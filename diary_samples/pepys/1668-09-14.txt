14th. Up betimes, and walked to the Temple, and stopped, viewing the
Exchange, and Paul’s, and St. Fayth’s, where strange how the very sight
of the stones falling from the top of the steeple do make me sea-sick!
But no hurt, I hear, hath yet happened in all this work of the steeple,
which is very much. So from the Temple I by coach to St. James’s, where
I find Sir W. Pen and Lord Anglesey, who delivered this morning his
answer to the Duke of York, but I could not see it. But after being
above with the Duke of York, but said nothing, I down with Mr. Wren; and
he and I read all over that I had, and I expounded them to him, and did
so order it that I had them home with me, so that I shall, to my heart’s
wish, be able to take a copy of them. After dinner, I by water to, White
Hall; and there, with the Cofferer and Sir Stephen Fox, attended
the Commissioners of the Treasury, about bettering our fund; and are
promised it speedily. Thence by water home, and so all the afternoon
and evening late busy at the office, and then home to supper, and Mrs.
Turner comes to see my wife before her journey to-morrow, but she is in
bed, and so sat talking to little purpose with me a great while, and,
she gone, I to bed.
