31st. This day my Lord took physic, and came not out of his chamber.

All the morning making orders. After dinner a great while below in the
great cabin trying with W. Howe some of Mr. Laws’ songs,’ particularly
that of “What is a kiss,” with which we had a great deal of pleasure.
After that to making of orders again. Captain Sparling of the Assistance
brought me a pair of silk stockings of a light blue, which I was
much pleased with. The Captain and I to supper, and after that a most
pleasant walk till to at night with him upon the deck, it being a fine
evening. My pain was gone again that I had yesterday, blessed be God.
This day the month ends, I in very good health, and all the world in a
merry mood because of the King’s coming. This day I began to teach Mr.
Edward; who I find to have a very good foundation laid for his Latin by
Mr. Fuller. I expect every minute to hear how my poor wife do. I find
myself in all things well as to body and mind, but troubled for the
absence of my wife.
