27th (Lord’s day). Very well in the morning, and up and to my chamber
all the morning to put my things and papers yet more in order, and so
to dinner. Thence all the afternoon at my office till late making up my
papers and letters there into a good condition of order, and so home to
supper, and after reading a good while in the King’s works,--[Charles
I.’s Works, now in the Pepysian Library]--which is a noble book, to bed.
