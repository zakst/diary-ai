20th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and here
among other things come Captain Cocke, and I did get him to sign me a
note for the L100 to pay for the plate he do present me with, which I am
very glad of. At noon home to dinner, where was Balty come, who is well
again, and the most recovered in his countenance that ever I did see.
Here dined with me also Mrs. Batters, poor woman! now left a sad widow
by the drowning of her husband the other day. I pity her, and will do
her what kindness I can; yet I observe something of ill-nature in myself
more than should be, that I am colder towards her in my charity than I
should be to one so painful as he and she have been and full of kindness
to their power to my wife and I. After dinner out with Balty, setting
him down at the Maypole in the Strand, and then I to my Lord Bellasses,
and there spoke with Mr. Moone about some business, and so away home
to my business at the office, and then home to supper and to bed,
after having finished the putting of little papers upon my books to be
numbered hereafter.
