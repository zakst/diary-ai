27th. Up, and to my office, where all the morning, at noon Creed dined
with me; and, after dinner, walked in the garden, he telling me that my
Lord Treasurer now begins to be scrupulous, and will know what becomes
of the L26,000 saved by my Lord Peterborough, before he parts with any
more money, which puts us into new doubts, and me into a great fear,
that all my cake will be doe still.

     [An obsolete proverb, signifying to lose one’s hopes, a cake coming
     out of the oven in a state of dough being considered spoiled.

         “My cake is dough; but I’ll in among the rest;
          Out of hope of all, but my share in the feast.”
                Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, act v., sc.  i.-M. B.]

But I am well prepared for it to bear it, being not clear whether it
will be more for my profit to have it, or go without it, as my profits
of the Navy are likely now to be. All the afternoon till late hard
at the office. Then to supper and to bed. This night William Hewer is
returned from Harwich, where he hath been paying off of some ships this
fortnight, and went to sea a good way with the fleete, which was 96
in company then, men of warr, besides some come in, and following them
since, which makes now above 100, whom God bless!
