20th. All the morning sitting at the office, at noon with Mr. Coventry
to the Temple to advise about Field’s, but our lawyers not being in the
way we went to St. James’s, and there at his chamber dined, and I am
still in love more and more with him for his real worth. I broke to
him my desire for my wife’s brother to send him to sea as a midshipman,
which he is willing to agree to, and will do it when I desire it. After
dinner to the Temple, to Mr. Thurland; and thence to my Lord Chief
Baron, Sir Edward Hale’s, and back with Mr. Thurland to his chamber,
where he told us that Field will have the better of us; and that we must
study to make up the business as well as we can, which do much vex and
trouble us: but I am glad the Duke is concerned in it. Thence by coach
homewards, calling at a tavern in the way (being guided by the messenger
in whose custody Field lies), and spoke with Mr. Smith our messenger
about the business, and so home, where I found that my wife had finished
very neatly my study with the former hangings of the diningroom, which
will upon occasion serve for a fine withdrawing room. So a little to
my office and so home, and spent the evening upon my house, and so to
supper and to bed.
