26th. Up at 4 o’clock, and all the morning in my office with W. Hewer
finishing my papers that were so long out of order, and at noon to my
bookseller’s, and there bespoke a book or two, and so home to dinner,
where Creed dined with me, and he and I afterwards to Alderman
Backewell’s to try him about supplying us with money, which he denied
at first and last also, saving that he spoke a little fairer at the end
than before. But the truth is I do fear I shall have a great deale of
trouble in getting of money. Thence home, and in the evening by water
to the Duke of Albemarle, whom I found mightily off the hooks, that the
ships are not gone out of the River; which vexed me to see, insomuch
that I am afeard that we must expect some change or addition of new
officers brought upon us, so that I must from this time forward resolve
to make myself appear eminently serviceable in attending at my office
duly and no where else, which makes me wish with all my heart that I had
never anything to do with this business of Tangier. After a while at my
office, home to supper vexed, and to bed.
