4th. At the office all the morning. At noon I went by appointment to the
Sun in Fish Street to a dinner of young Mr. Bernardâ€™s for myself, Mr.
Phillips, Davenport, Weaver, &c., where we had a most excellent dinner,
but a pie of such pleasant variety of good things, as in all my life I
never tasted. Hither came to me Captain Lambert to take his leave of me,
he being this day to set sail for the Straights. We drank his farewell
and a health to all our friends, and were very merry, and drank wine
enough. Hence to the Temple to Mr. Turner about drawing up my bill in
Chancery against T. Trice, and so to Salisbury Court, where Mrs. Turner
is come to town to-night, but very ill still of an ague, which I was
sorry to see. So to the Wardrobe and talked with my Lady, and so home
and to bed.
