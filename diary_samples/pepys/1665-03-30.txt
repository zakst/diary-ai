30th. Up, and to my Lord Ashly, but did nothing, and to Sir Ph. Warwicke
and spoke with him about business, and so back to the office, where
all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and thence to the Tangier
Committee, where, Lord! to see how they did run into the giving of Sir
J. Lawson (who is come to towne to-day to get this business done) L4000
about his Mole business, and were going to give him 4s. per yarde more,
which arises in the whole Mole to L36,000, is a strange thing, but the
latter by chance was stopped, the former was given. Thence to see Mrs.
Martin, whose husband being it seems gone away, and as she is informed
he hath another woman whom he uses, and has long done, as a wife, she is
mighty reserved and resolved to keep herself so till the return of her
husband, which a pleasant thing to think of her. Thence home, and to my
office, where late, and to bed.
