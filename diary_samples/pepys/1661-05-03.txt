3rd. Early to walk with Mr. Creed up and down the town, and it was in
his and some others’ thoughts to have got me made free of the town, but
the Mayor, it seems, unwilling, and so they could not do it. Then to
the payhouse, and there paid off the ship, and so to a short dinner,
and then took coach, leaving Mrs. Hater there to stay with her husband’s
friends, and we to Petersfield, having nothing more of trouble in all
my journey, but the exceeding unmannerly and most epicure-like palate
of Mr. Creed. Here my wife and I lay in the room the Queen lately lay at
her going into France.
