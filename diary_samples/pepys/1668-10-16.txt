16th. Up, and busy all the morning at the office, and before noon I took
my wife by coach, and Deb., and shewed her Mr. Wren’s hangings and
bed, at St. James’s, and Sir W. Coventry’s in the Pell Mell, for our
satisfaction in what we are going to buy; and so by Mr. Crow’s,
home, about his hangings, and do pitch upon buying his second suit of
Apostles-the whole suit, which comes to L83; and this we think the best
for us, having now the whole suit, to answer any other rooms or service.
So home to dinner, and with Mr. Hater by water to St. James’s: there Mr.
Hater, to give Mr. Wren thanks for his kindness about his place that he
hath lately granted him, of Petty Purveyor of petty emptions, upon the
removal of Mr. Turner to be Storekeeper at Deptford, on the death of
Harper. And then we all up to the Duke of York, and there did our usual
business, and so I with J. Minnes home, and there finding my wife gone
to my aunt Wight’s, to see her the first time after her coming to town,
and indeed the first time, I think, these two years (we having been
great strangers one to the other for a great while), I to them; and
there mighty kindly used, and had a barrel of oysters, and so to look
up and down their house, they having hung a room since I was there, but
with hangings not fit to be seen with mine, which I find all come home
to-night, and here staying an hour or two we home, and there to supper
and to bed.
