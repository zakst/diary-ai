22nd. To church in the morning, where the Reader made a boyish young
sermon. Home to dinner, and there I took occasion, from the blacknesse
of the meat as it came out of the pot, to fall out with my wife and my
maid for their sluttery, and so left the table, and went up to read in
Mr. Selden till church time, and then my wife and I to church, and there
in the pew, with the rest of the company, was Captain Holmes, in his
gold-laced suit, at which I was troubled because of the old business
which he attempted upon my wife. So with my mind troubled I sat still,
but by and by I took occasion from the rain now holding up (it raining
when we came into the church) to put my wife in mind of going to the
christening (which she was invited to) of N. Osborneâ€™s child, which she
did, and so went out of the pew, and my mind was eased. So home after
sermon and there came by appointment Dr. T. Pepys, Will. Joyce, and my
brother Tom, and supped with me, and very merry they were, and I seemed
to be, but I was not pleased at all with their company. So they being
gone we went to bed.
