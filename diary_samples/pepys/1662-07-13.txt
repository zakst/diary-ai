13th (Lordâ€™s day).... I had my old pain all yesterday and this morning,
and so kept my bed all this morning. So up and after dinner and some
of my people to church, I set about taking down my books and papers and
making my chamber fit against to-morrow to have the people come to work
in pulling down the top of my house. In the evening I walked to the
garden and sent for Mr. Turner (who yesterday did give me occasion of
speaking to him about the difference between him and me), and I told him
my whole mind, and how it was in my power to do him a discourtesy about
his place of petty purveyance, and at last did make him see (I think)
that it was his concernment to be friendly to me and what belongs to me.
After speaking my mind to him and he to me, we walked down and took boat
at the Tower and to Deptford, on purpose to sign and seal a couple of
warrants, as justice of peace in Kent, against one Annis, who is to be
tried next Tuesday, at Maidstone assizes, for stealing some lead out of
Woolwich Yard. Going and coming I did discourse with Mr. Turner about
the faults of our management of the business of our office, of which he
is sensible, but I believe is a very knave. Come home I found a rabbit
at the fire, and so supped well, and so to my journall and to bed.
