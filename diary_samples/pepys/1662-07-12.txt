12th. Up by five o’clock, and put things in my house in order to be laid
up, against my workmen come on Monday to take down the top of my house,
which trouble I must go through now, but it troubles me much to think of
it. So to my office, where till noon we sat, and then I to dinner and to
the office all the afternoon with much business. At night with Cooper at
arithmetique, and then came Mr. Creed about my Lord’s accounts to even
them, and he gone I to supper and to bed.
