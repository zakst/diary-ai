2d. At the office all the morning; where Sir John Minnes, our new
comptroller, was fetched by Sir Wm. Pen and myself from Sir Wm.
Batten’s, and led to his place in the office. The first time that he had
come hither, and he seems a good fair condition man, and one that I
am glad hath the office. After the office done, I to the Wardrobe, and
there dined, and in the afternoon had an hour or two’s talk with my Lady
with great pleasure. And so with the two young ladies by coach to my
house, and gave them some entertainment, and so late at night sent them
home with Captain Ferrers by coach. This night my boy Wayneman, as I was
in my chamber, I overheard him let off some gunpowder; and hearing my
wife chide him below for it, and a noise made, I call him up, and find
that it was powder that he had put in his pocket, and a match carelessly
with it, thinking that it was out, and so the match did give fire to the
powder, and had burnt his side and his hand that he put into his pocket
to put out the fire. But upon examination, and finding him in a lie
about the time and place that he bought it, I did extremely beat him,
and though it did trouble me to do it, yet I thought it necessary to do
it. So to write by the post, and to bed.
