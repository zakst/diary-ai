3rd. Up and to the office, where all the forenoon, and then (by Mr.
Coventry’s coach) to the ‘Change, and so home to dinner, very pleasant
with my poor wife. Somebody from Portsmouth, I know not who, has this
day sent me a Runlett of Tent. So to my office all the afternoon, where
much business till late at night, and so home to my wife, and then to
supper and to bed. This day Sir G. Carteret did tell us at the table,
that the Navy (excepting what is due to the Yards upon the quarter now
going on, and what few bills he hath not heard of) is quite out of debt;
which is extraordinary good newes, and upon the ‘Change to hear how our
creditt goes as good as any merchant’s upon the ‘Change is a joyfull
thing to consider, which God continue! I am sure the King will have the
benefit of it, as well as we some peace and creditt.
