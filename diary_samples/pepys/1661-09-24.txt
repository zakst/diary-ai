24th. We rose, and set forth, but found a most sad alteration in the
road by reason of last night’s rains, they being now all dirty and
washy, though not deep. So we rode easily through, and only drinking at
Holloway, at the sign of a woman with cakes in one hand and a pot of ale
in the other, which did give good occasion of mirth, resembling her to
the maid that served us, we got home very timely and well, and finding
there all well, and letters from sea, that speak of my Lord’s
being well, and his action, though not considerable of any side, at
Argier.--[Algiers]--I went straight to my Lady, and there sat and talked
with her, and so home again, and after supper we to bed somewhat weary,
hearing of nothing ill since my absence but my brother Tom, who is
pretty well though again.
