7th. Lay long, then up, and among others Bagwell’s wife coming to speak
with me put new thoughts of folly into me which I am troubled at. Thence
after doing business at my office, I by coach to my Lady Sandwich’s,
and there dined with her, and found all well and merry. Thence to White
Hall, and we waited on the Duke, who looks better than he did, methinks,
before his voyage; and, I think, a little more stern than he used to do.
Thence to the Temple to my cozen Roger Pepys, thinking to have met the
Doctor to have discoursed our business, but he came not, so I home,
and there by agreement came my Lord Rutherford, Povy, Gauden, Creed,
Alderman Backewell, about Tangier business of accounts between
Rutherford and Gauden. Here they were with me an hour or more, then
after drinking away, and Povy and Creed staid and eat with me; but I was
sorry I had no better cheer for Povy; for the foole may be useful, and
is a cunning fellow in his way, which is a strange one, and that, that
I meet not in any other man, nor can describe in him. They late with me,
and when gone my boy and I to musique, and then to bed.
