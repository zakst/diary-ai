13th. So up and by coach to Sir W. Coventry’s, but he gone out, so I to
White Hall, and thence walked out into the Park, all in the snow, with
the Duke of York and the rest, and so home, after visiting my Lady
Peterborough, and there by invitation find Mr. Povy, and there was also
Talbot Pepys, newly come from Impington, and dined with me; and after
dinner and a little talk with Povy about publick matters, he gone, and
I and my wife and Talbot towards the Temple, and there to the King’s
playhouse, and there saw, I think, “The Maiden Queene,” and so home and
to supper and read, and to bed. This day come home the instrument I have
so long longed for, the Parallelogram.
