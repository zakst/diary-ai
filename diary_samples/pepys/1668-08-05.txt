5th. So to bed about two o’clock, and then up about seven and to White
Hall, where read over my report to Lord Arlington and Berkeley, and then
afterward at the Council Board with great good liking, but, Lord! how it
troubled my eyes, though I did not think I could have done it, but did
do it, and was not very bad afterward. So home to dinner, and thence out
to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Guardian;” formerly
the same, I find, that was called “Cutter of Coleman Street;” a silly
play. And thence to Westminster Hall, where I met Fitzgerald; and with
him to a tavern, to consider of the instructions for Sir Thomas Allen,
against his going to Algiers; he and I being designed to go down to
Portsmouth by the Council’s order, and by and by he and I went to the
Duke of York, who orders me to go down to-morrow morning. So I away
home, and there bespeak a coach; and so home and to bed, my wife being
abroad with the Mercers walking in the fields, and upon the water.
