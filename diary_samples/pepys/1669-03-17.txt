17th. Up, and by water to see Mr. Wren, and then Mr. Williamson, who
did shew me the very original bookes of propositions made by the
Commissioners for the Navy, in 1618, to my great content; but no other
Navy papers he could now shew me. Thence to Westminster by water and to
the Hall, where Mrs. Michell do surprize me with the news that Doll Lane
is suddenly brought to bed at her sister’s lodging, and gives it out
that she is married, but there is no such thing certainly, she never
mentioning it before, but I have cause to rejoice that I have not seen
her a great while, she having several times desired my company, but I
doubt to an evil end. Thence to the Exchequer, where W. Hewer come to
me, and after a little business did go by water home, and there dined,
and took my wife by a hackney to the King’s playhouse, and saw “The
Coxcomb,” the first time acted, but an old play, and a silly one, being
acted only by the young people. Here met cozen Turner and The. So parted
there from them, and home by coach and to my letters at the office,
where pretty late, and so to supper and to bed.
