5th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten (at whose lodgings calling for him, I
saw his Lady the first time since her coming to towne since the plague,
having absented myself designedly to shew some discontent, and that I am
not at all the more suppliant because of my Lord Sandwich’s fall), to
my Lord Bruncker’s, to see whether he goes to the Duke’s this morning
or no. But it is put off, and so we parted. My Lord invited me to dinner
to-day to dine with Sir W. Batten and his Lady there, who were invited
before, but lest he should thinke so little an invitation would serve
my turne I refused and parted, and to Westminster about business, and
so back to the ‘Change, and there met Mr. Hill, newly come to town,
and with him the Houblands, preparing for their ship’s and his going to
Tangier, and agreed that I must sup with them to-night. So home and eat
a bit, and then to White Hall to a Committee for Tangier, but it did
not meet but was put off to to-morrow, so I did some little business and
visited my Lord Sandwich, and so, it raining, went directly to the Sun,
behind the Exchange, about seven o’clock, where I find all the five
brothers Houblons, and mighty fine gentlemen they are all, and used me
mighty respectfully. We were mighty civilly merry, and their discourses,
having been all abroad, very fine. Here late and at last accompanied
home with Mr. J. Houblon and Hill, whom I invited to sup with me on
Friday, and so parted and I home to bed.
