15th. Up, and carrying my wife to my Lord’s lodgings left her, and I to
White Hall, to the Duke; where he first put on a periwigg to-day; but
methought his hair cut short in order thereto did look very prettily of
itself, before he put on his periwigg.

     [Charles II. followed his brother in the use of the periwig in the
     following April.]

Thence to his closet and there did our business, and thence Mr. Coventry
and I down to his chamber and spent a little time, and so parted, and
I took my wife homeward, I stopping at the Coffee-house, and thence
a while to the ‘Change, where great newes of the arrivall of two rich
ships, the Greyhound and another, which they were mightily afeard of,
and great insurance given, and so home to dinner, and after an houre
with my wife at her globes, I to the office, where very busy till 11
at night, and so home to supper and to bed. This afternoon Sir Thomas
Chamberlin came to the office to me, and showed me several letters from
the East Indys, showing the height that the Dutch are come to there,
showing scorn to all the English, even in our only Factory there of
Surat, beating several men, and hanging the English Standard St. George
under the Dutch flagg in scorn; saying, that whatever their masters do
or say at home, they will do what they list, and will be masters of all
the world there; and have so proclaimed themselves Soveraigne of all the
South Seas; which certainly our King cannot endure, if the Parliament
will give him money. But I doubt and yet do hope they will not yet, till
we are more ready for it.
