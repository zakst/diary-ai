5th. Got right again with much ado, after two or three circles and so
on, and at Greenwich set in Captain Cocke, and I set forward, hailing to
all the King’s ships at Deptford, but could not wake any man: so that we
could have done what we would with their ships. At last waked one man;
but it was a merchant ship, the Royall Catharine: so to the Towerdock
and home, where the girl sat up for me. It was about three o’clock,
and putting Mr. Boddam out of my bed, went to bed, and lay till nine
o’clock, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I did
give some accounts of my service. Dined alone at home, and was glad my
house is begun tiling. And to the office again all the afternoon, till
it was so dark that I could not see hardly what it is that I now set
down when I write this word, and so went to my chamber and to bed, being
sleepy.
