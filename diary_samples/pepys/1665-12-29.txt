29th. Up betimes, and all day long within doors upon my accounts,
publique and private, and find the ill effect of letting them go so
long without evening, that no soul could have ever understood them but
myself, and I with much ado. But, however, my regularity in all I did
and spent do helpe me, and I hope to find them well. Late at them and to
bed.
