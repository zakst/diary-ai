26th. Up by four o’clock in the morning, and fell to the preparing of
some accounts for my Lord of Sandwich. By and by, by appointment comes
Mr. Moore, and, by what appears to us at present, we found that my Lord
is above L7,000 in debt, and that he hath money coming into him that
will clear all, and so we think him clear, but very little money in his
purse. So to my Lord’s, and after he was ready, we spent an hour with
him, giving him an account thereof; and he having some L6,000 in his
hands, remaining of the King’s, he is resolved to make use of that, and
get off of it as well as he can, which I like well of, for else I fear
he will scarce get beforehand again a great while. Thence home, and
to the Trinity House; where the Brethren (who have been at Deptford
choosing a new Maister; which is Sir J. Minnes, notwithstanding Sir W.
Batten did contend highly for it: at which I am not a little pleased,
because of his proud lady) about three o’clock came hither, and so to
dinner. I seated myself close by Mr. Prin, who, in discourse with me,
fell upon what records he hath of the lust and wicked lives of the
nuns heretofore in England, and showed me out of his pocket one wherein
thirty nuns for their lust were ejected of their house, being not fit
to live there, and by the Pope’s command to be put, however, into
other nunnerys. I could not stay to end dinner with them, but rose, and
privately went out, and by water to my brother’s, and thence to take my
wife to the Redd Bull, where we saw “Doctor Faustus,” but so wretchedly
and poorly done, that we were sick of it, and the worse because by
a former resolution it is to be the last play we are to see till
Michaelmas. Thence homewards by coach, through Moorefields, where we
stood awhile, and saw the wrestling. At home, got my lute upon the
leads, and there played, and so to bed.
