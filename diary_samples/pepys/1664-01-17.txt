17th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and I and my wife to church, where Pembleton
appeared, which, God forgive me, did vex me, but I made nothing of it.
So home to dinner, and betimes my wife and I to the French church and
there heard a good sermon, the first time my wife and I were there ever
together. We sat by three sisters, all pretty women. It was pleasant to
hear the reader give notice to them, that the children to be catechized
next Sunday were them of Hounsditch and Blanche Chapiton. Thence home,
and there found Ashwell come to see my wife (we having called at her
lodging the other, day to speak with her about dressing my wife when
my Lord Sandwich dines here), and is as merry as ever, and speaks as
disconcerned for any difference between us on her going away as ever.
She being gone, my wife and I to see Sir W. Pen and there supped with
him much against my stomach, for the dishes were so deadly foule that I
could not endure to look upon them. So after supper home to prayers and
to bed.
