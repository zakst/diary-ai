10th (Lord’s day). Lay in bed with my wife till 10 or 11 o’clock, having
been very sleepy all night. So up, and my brother Tom being come to
see me, we to dinner, he telling me how Mrs. Turner found herself
discontented with her late bad journey, and not well taken by them in
the country, they not desiring her coming down, nor the burials of Mr.
Edward Pepys’s corps there. After dinner I to the office, where all the
afternoon, and at night my wife and I to my uncle Wight’s, and there eat
some of their swan pie, which was good, and I invited them to my house
to eat a roasted swan on Tuesday next, which after I was come home did
make a quarrels between my wife and I, because she had appointed a wish
to-morrow. But, however, we were friends again quickly. So to bed.
All our discourse to-night was Mr. Tryan’s late being robbed; and that
Collonell Turner (a mad, swearing, confident fellow, well known by all,
and by me), one much indebted to this man for his very livelihood, was
the man that either did or plotted it; and the money and things are
found in his hand, and he and his wife now in Newgate for it; of which
we are all glad, so very a known rogue he was.
