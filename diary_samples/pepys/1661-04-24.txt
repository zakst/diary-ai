24th. Waked in the morning with my head in a sad taking through the last
night’s drink, which I am very sorry for; so rose and went out with Mr.
Creed to drink our morning draft, which he did give me in chocolate

     [Chocolate was introduced into England about the year 1652.  In the
     “Publick Advertiser” of Tuesday, June 16-22, 1657, we find the
     following; “In Bishopsgate Street in Queen’s Head Alley, at a
     Frenchman’s house, is an excellent West India drink called
     chocolate, to be sold, where you may have it ready at any time, and

Frankelyn at the next door to Mrs. Hunt’s, and they were ready, and so I
took them up in a coach, and carried the ladies to Paul’s, and there
set her down, and so my wife and I home, and I to the office. That being
done my wife and I went to dinner to Sir W. Batten, and all our talk
about the happy conclusion of these last solemnities. After dinner home,
and advised with my wife about ordering things in my house, and then
she went away to my father’s to lie, and I staid with my workmen, who do
please me very well with their work. At night, set myself to write down
these three days’ diary, and while I am about it, I hear the noise of
the chambers,--[A chamber is a small piece of ordnance.]--and other
things of the fire-works, which are now playing upon the Thames before
the King; and I wish myself with them, being sorry not to see them. So
to bed.
