25th (Christmas-day). Up, and continued on my waistcoat, the first day
this winter, and I to church, where Alderman Backewell, coming in late,
I beckoned to his lady to come up to us, who did, with another lady;
and after sermon, I led her down through the church to her husband and
coach, a noble, fine woman, and a good one, and one my wife shall be
acquainted with. So home, and to dinner alone with my wife, who, poor
wretch! sat undressed all day, till ten at night, altering and lacing of
a noble petticoat: while I by her, making the boy read to me the Life of
Julius Caesar, and Des Cartes’ book of Musick

     [“Musicae Compendium.”  By Rene Des Cartes, Amsterdam, 1617;
     rendered into English, London, 1653, 4to.  The translator, whose
     name did not appear on the title, was William, Viscount Brouncker,
     Pepys’s colleague, who proved his knowledge of music by the
     performance.]

--the latter of which I understand not, nor think he did well that writ
it, though a most learned man. Then, after supper, I made the boy play
upon his lute, which I have not done twice before since he come to me;
and so, my mind in mighty content, we to bed.
