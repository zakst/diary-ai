17th (Lord’s day). Up and in my chamber all the morning, preparing my
great letters to my father, stating to him the perfect condition of our
estate. My wife and Ashwell to church, and after dinner they to church
again, and I all the afternoon making an end of my morning’s work,
which I did about the evening, and then to talk with my wife till after
supper, and so to bed having another small falling out and myself vexed
with my old fit of jealousy about her dancing-master. But I am a fool
for doing it. So to bed by daylight, I having a very great cold, so as
I doubt whether I shall be able to speak to-morrow at our attending the
Duke, being now so hoarse.
