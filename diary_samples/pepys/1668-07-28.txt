28th. All the morning at the office, and after dinner with my wife and
Deb. to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “The Slighted Maid,”
 but a mean play; and thence home, there being little pleasure now in a
play, the company being but little. Here we saw Gosnell, who is become
very homely, and sings meanly, I think, to what I thought she did.
