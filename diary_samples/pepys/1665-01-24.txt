24th. Up and by coach to Westminster Hall and the Parliament House, and
there spoke with Mr. Coventry and others about business and so back to
the â€˜Change, where no news more than that the Dutch have, by consent of
all the Provinces, voted no trade to be suffered for eighteen months,
but that they apply themselves wholly to the warr.

     [This statement of a total prohibition of all trade, and for so long
     a period as eighteen months, by a government so essentially
     commercial as that of the United Provinces, seems extraordinary.
     The fact was, that when in the beginning of the year 1665 the States
     General saw that the war with England was become inevitable, they
     took several vigorous measures, and determined to equip a formidable
     fleet, and with a view to obtain a sufficient number of men to man
     it, prohibited all navigation, especially in the great and small
     fisheries as they were then called, and in the whale fishery.  This
     measure appears to have resembled the embargoes so commonly resorted
     to in this country on similar occasions, rather than a total
     prohibition of trade.--B.]

And they say it is very true, but very strange, for we use to believe
they cannot support themselves without trade. Thence home to dinner
and then to the office, where all the afternoon, and at night till
very late, and then home to supper and bed, having a great cold, got on
Sunday last, by sitting too long with my head bare, for Mercer to comb
my hair and wash my eares.
