6d. So out, and lost our way, which made me vexed, but come into it
again; and in the evening betimes come to Reading, and there heard my
wife read more of “Mustapha,” and then to supper, and then I to walk
about the town, which is a very great one, I think bigger than Salsbury:
a river runs through it, in seven branches, and unite in one, in one
part of the town, and runs into the Thames half-a-mile off one odd sign
of the Broad Face. W. Hewer troubled with the headake we had none of his
company last night, nor all this day nor night to talk. Then to my inn,
and so to bed.
