28th. Up, and sent for Thomas Willson, and broke the victualling
business to him and he is mightily contented, and so am I that I have
bestowed it on him, and so I to Mr. Boreman’s, where Sir W. Batten is,
to tell him what I had proposed to Thomas Willson, and the newes also I
have this morning from Sir W. Clerke, which is, that notwithstanding
all the care the Duke of Albemarle hath taken about the putting the
East India prize goods into the East India Company’s hands, and my Lord
Bruncker and Sir J. Minnes having laden out a great part of the goods,
an order is come from Court to stop all, and to have the goods delivered
to the Sub-Commissioners of prizes. At which I am glad, because it do
vex this simple weake man, and we shall have a little reparation for
the disgrace my Lord Sandwich has had in it. He tells me also that the
Parliament hath given the Duke of Yorke L120,000, to be paid him after
the L1,250,000 is gathered upon the tax which they have now given the
King.

     [This sum was granted by the Commons to Charles, with a request that
     he would bestow it on his brother.--B.]

He tells me that the Dutch have lately launched sixteen new ships; all
which is great news. Thence by horsebacke with Mr. Deane to Erith, and
so aboard my Lord Bruncker and dined, and very merry with him and good
discourse between them about ship building, and, after dinner and a
little pleasant discourse, we away and by horse back again to Greenwich,
and there I to the office very late, offering my persons for all the
victualling posts much to my satisfaction. Also much other business I
did to my mind, and so weary home to my lodging, and there after eating
and drinking a little I to bed. The King and Court, they say, have
now finally resolved to spend nothing upon clothes, but what is of the
growth of England; which, if observed, will be very pleasing to the
people, and very good for them.
