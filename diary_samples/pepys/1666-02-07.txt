7th. It being fast day I staid at home all day long to set things to
rights in my chamber by taking out all my books, and putting my chamber
in the same condition it was before the plague. But in the morning doing
of it, and knocking up a nail I did bruise my left thumb so as broke
a great deal of my flesh off, that it hung by a little. It was a sight
frighted my wife, but I put some balsam of Mrs. Turnerâ€™s to it, and
though in great pain, yet went on with my business, and did it to my
full content, setting every thing in order, in hopes now that the worst
of our fears are over as to the plague for the next year. Interrupted I
was by two or three occasions this day to my great vexation, having this
the only day I have been able to set apart for this work since my
coming to town. At night to supper, weary, and to bed, having had the
plasterers and joiners also to do some jobbs.
