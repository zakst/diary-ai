12th. At the office this morning. At home in the afternoon, and had
notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with
the fruit that I did give them on Saturday last at my house: so in the
evening I went thither and there found him very ill, and in great fear
of the smallpox. I supped with my Lady, and did consult about him, but
we find it best to let him lie where he do; and so I went home with my
heart full of trouble for my Lord Hinchinabroke’s sickness, and more for
my Lord Sandwich’s himself, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at
Alicante, who, if he should miscarry, God knows in what condition would
his family be. I dined to-day with my Lord Crew, who is now at Sir H.
Wright’s, while his new house is making fit for him, and he is much
troubled also at these things.
