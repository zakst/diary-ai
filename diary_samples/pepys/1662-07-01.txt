July 1st. To the office, and there we sat till past noon, and then
Captain Cuttance and I by water to Deptford, where the Royal James (in
which my Lord went out the last voyage, though [he] came back in the
Charles) was paying off by Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen. So to dinner,
where I had Mr. Sheply to dine with us, and from thence I sent to my
Lord to know whether she should be a first rate, as the men would have
her, or a second. He answered that we should forbear paying the officers
and such whose pay differed upon the rate of the ship, till he could
speak with his Royal Highness. To the Pay again after dinner, and seeing
of Cooper, the mate of the ship, whom I knew in the Charles, I spoke
to him about teaching the mathematiques, and do please myself in my
thoughts of learning of him, and bade him come to me in a day or two.
Towards evening I left them, and to Redriffe by land, Mr. Cowly, the
Clerk of the Cheque, with me, discoursing concerning the abuses of the
yard, in which he did give me much light. So by water home, and after
half an hour sitting talking with my wife, who was afeard I did intend
to go with my Lord to fetch the Queen mother over, in which I did clear
her doubts, I went to bed by daylight, in order to my rising early
to-morrow.
