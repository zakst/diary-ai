11th (Lord’s day). To our church in the morning, where, our Minister
being out of town, a dull, flat Presbiter preached. Dined at home,
and my wife’s brother with us, we having a good dish of stewed beef of
Jane’s own dressing, which was well done, and a piece of sturgeon of
a barrel sent me by Captain Cocke. In the afternoon to White Hall; and
there walked an hour or two in the Park, where I saw the King now out
of mourning, in a suit laced with gold and silver, which it was said
was out of fashion. Thence to the Wardrobe; and there consulted with the
ladies about our going to Hampton Court to-morrow, and thence home, and
after settled business there my wife and I to the Wardrobe, and there we
lay all night in Captain Ferrers’ chambers, but the bed so soft that I
could not sleep that hot night.
