28th. Up betimes, and to Sir W. Coventry’s by water, but lost my labour,
so through the Park to White Hall, and thence to my Lord Crew’s to
advise again with him about my Lord Sandwich, and so to the office,
where till noon, and then I by coach to Westminster Hall, and there
do understand that the business of religion, and the Act against
Conventicles, have so taken them up all this morning, and do still, that
my Lord Sandwich’s business is not like to come on to-day, which I am
heartily glad of. This law against Conventicles is very severe; but
Creed, whom I met here, do tell me that, it being moved that Papists’
meetings might be included, the House was divided upon it, and it was
carried in the negative; which will give great disgust to the people,
I doubt. Thence with Creed to Hercules Pillars by the Temple again,
and there dined he and I all alone, and thence to the King’s house, and
there did see “Love in a Maze,” wherein very good mirth of Lacy, the
clown, and Wintersell, the country-knight, his master. Thence to the New
Exchange to pay a debt of my wife’s there, and so home, and there to the
office and walk in the garden in the dark to ease my eyes, and so home
to supper and to bed.
