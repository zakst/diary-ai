21st. With Sir W. Batten by water to Whitehall, and he to Westminster. I
went to see Sarah and my Lord’s lodgings, which are now all in dirt, to
be repaired against my Lord’s coming from sea with the Queen. Thence
to Westminster Hall; and there walked up and down and heard the great
difference that hath been between my Lord Chancellor and my Lord of
Bristol, about a proviso that my Lord Chancellor would have brought into
the Bill for Conformity, that it shall be in the power of the King, when
he sees fit, to dispense with the Act of Conformity; and though it be
carried in the House of Lords, yet it is believed it will hardly pass
in the Commons. Here I met with Chetwind, Parry, and several others, and
went to a little house behind the Lords’ house to drink some wormwood
ale, which doubtless was a bawdy house, the mistress of the house having
the look and dress: Here we staid till noon and then parted, I by water
to the Wardrobe to meet my wife, but my Lady and they had dined, and so
I dined with the servants, and then up to my Lady, and there staid and
talked a good while, and then parted and walked into Cheapside, and
there saw my little picture, for which I am to sit again the next week.
So home, and staid late writing at my office, and so home and to bed,
troubled that now my boy is also fallen sick of an ague we fear.
