2nd. Up, and at the office all the morning. At noon with Lord Brouncker
in his coach as far as the Temple, and there ‘light and to Hercules
Pillars, and there dined, and thence to the Duke of York’s playhouse,
at a little past twelve, to get a good place in the pit, against the new
play, and there setting a poor man to keep my place, I out, and spent an
hour at Martin’s, my bookseller’s, and so back again, where I find the
house quite full. But I had my place, and by and by the King comes and
the Duke of York; and then the play begins, called “The Sullen Lovers;
or, The Impertinents,” having many good humours in it, but the play
tedious, and no design at all in it. But a little boy, for a farce, do
dance Polichinelli, the best that ever anything was done in the world,
by all men’s report: most pleased with that, beyond anything in the
world, and much beyond all the play. Thence to the King’s house to see
Knepp, but the play done; and so I took a hackney alone, and to the
park, and there spent the evening, and to the lodge, and drank new milk.
And so home to the Office, ended my letters, and, to spare my eyes,
home, and played on my pipes, and so to bed.
