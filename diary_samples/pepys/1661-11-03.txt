3rd (Lord’s day). This day I stirred not out, but took physique, and it
did work very well, and all the day as I was at leisure I did read in
Fuller’s Holy Warr, which I have of late bought, and did try to make a
song in the praise of a liberall genius (as I take my own to be) to all
studies and pleasures, but it not proving to my mind I did reject it
and so proceeded not in it. At night my wife and I had a good supper by
ourselves of a pullet hashed, which pleased me much to see my condition
come to allow ourselves a dish like that, and so at night to bed.
