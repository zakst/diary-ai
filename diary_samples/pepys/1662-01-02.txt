2nd. An invitation sent us before we were up from my Lady Sandwich’s,
to come and dine with her: so at the office all the morning, and at
noon thither to dinner, where there was a good and great dinner, and the
company, Mr. William Montagu and his Lady (but she seemed so far from
the beauty that I expected her from my Lady’s talk to be, that it put
me into an ill humour all the day, to find my expectation so lost), Mr.
Rurttball and Townsend and their wives. After dinner, borne by water,
and so to the office till night, and then I went forth, by appointment,
to meet with Mr. Grant, who promised to meet me at the Coffee-house to
bring me acquainted with Cooper the great limner in little, but they
deceived me, and so I went home, and there sat at my lute and singing
till almost twelve at night, and so to bed. Sir Richd. Fanshaw is come
suddenly from Portugall, but nobody knows what his business is.
