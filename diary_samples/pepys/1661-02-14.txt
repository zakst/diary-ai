14th (Valentine’s day). Up early and to Sir W. Batten’s, but would not
go in till I asked whether they that opened the door was a man or a
woman, and Mingo, who was there, answered a woman, which, with his tone,
made me laugh; so up I went and took Mrs. Martha for my Valentine (which
I do only for complacency), and Sir W. Batten he go in the same manner
to my wife, and so we were very merry. About 10 o’clock we, with a great
deal of company, went down by our barge to Deptford, and there only went
to see how forward Mr. Pett’s yacht is; and so all into the barge again,
and so to Woolwich, on board the Rose-bush, Captain Brown’s’ ship, that
is brother-in-law to Sir W. Batten, where we had a very fine dinner,
dressed on shore, and great mirth and all things successfull; the first
time I ever carried my wife a-ship-board, as also my boy Wayneman, who
hath all this day been called young Pepys, as Sir W. Pen’s boy young
Pen. So home by barge again; good weather, but pretty cold. I to my
study, and began to make up my accounts for my Lord, which I intend to
end tomorrow. To bed. The talk of the town now is, who the King is
like to have for his Queen: and whether Lent shall be kept with the
strictness of the King’s proclamation;

     [“A Proclamation for restraint of killing, dressing, and eating of
     Flesh in Lent or on fish-dayes appointed by the law to be observed,”
      was dated 29th January, 1660-61].

which it is thought cannot be, because of the poor, who cannot buy
fish. And also the great preparation for the King’s crowning is now much
thought upon and talked of.
