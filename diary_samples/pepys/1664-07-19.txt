19th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon
dined alone at home. After dinner Sir W. Batten and I down by water to
Woolwich, where coming to the ropeyarde we are told that Mr. Falconer,
who hath been ill of a relapse these two days, is just now dead. We
went up to his widow, who is sicke in bed also. The poor woman in great
sorrow, and entreats our friendship, which we shall, I think, in every
thing do for her. I am sure I will. Thence to the Docke, and there in
Sheldon’s garden eat some fruit; so to Deptford a little, and thence
home, it raining mightily, and being cold I doubted my health after it.
At the office till 9 o’clock about Sir W. Warren’s contract for masts,
and then at home with Lanyon and Yeabsly till 12 and past about their
contract for Tangier, wherein they and I differed, for I would have it
drawn to the King’s advantage, as much as might be, which they did not
like, but parted good friends; however, when they were gone, I wished
that I had forborne any disagreement till I had had their promise to me
in writing. They being gone, I to bed.
