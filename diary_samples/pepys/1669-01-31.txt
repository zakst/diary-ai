31st (Lord’s day). Lay long talking with pleasure, and so up and I to
church, and there did hear the Doctor that is lately turned Divine,
I have forgot his name, I met him a while since at Sir D. Gawden’s
at dinner, Dr. Waterhouse! He preaches in a devout manner of way, not
elegant nor very persuasive, but seems to mean well, and that he would
preach holily; and was mighty passionate against people that make a
scoff of religion. And, the truth is, I did observe Mrs. Hollworthy
smile often, and many others of the parish, who, I perceive, have known
him, and were in mighty expectation of hearing him preach, but could not
forbear smiling, and she particularly upon me, and I on her. So home to
dinner: and before dinner to my Office, to set down my journal for this
week, and then home to dinner; and after dinner to get my wife and boy,
one after another, to read to me: and so spent the afternoon and the
evening, and so after supper to bed. And thus endeth this month, with
many different days of sadness and mirth, from differences between me
and my wife, from her remembrance of my late unkindness to her with
Willet, she not being able to forget it, but now and then hath her
passionate remembrance of it as often as prompted to it by any occasion;
but this night we are at present very kind. And so ends this month.
