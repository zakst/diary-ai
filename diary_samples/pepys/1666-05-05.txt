5th. At the office all the morning. After dinner upon a letter from
the fleete from Sir W. Coventry I did do a great deale of worke for the
sending away of the victuallers that are in the river, &c., too much to
remember. Till 10 at night busy about letters and other necessary matter
of the office. About 11 home, it being a fine moonshine and so my wife
and Mercer come into the garden, and, my business being done, we sang
till about twelve at night, with mighty pleasure to ourselves and
neighbours, by their casements opening, and so home to supper and to
bed.
