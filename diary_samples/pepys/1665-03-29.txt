29th. Up betimes and to Povy’s, where a good while talking about our
business; thence abroad into the City, but upon his tally could not get
any money in Lumbard Streete, through the disrepute which he suffers,
I perceive, upon his giving up his place, which people think was not
choice, but necessity, as indeed it was. So back to his house, after we
had been at my house to taste my wine, but my wife being abroad nobody
could come at it, and so we were defeated. To his house, and before
dinner he and I did discourse of the business of freight, wherein I am
so much concerned, above L100 for myself, and in my over hasty making
a bill out for the rest for him, but he resolves to move Creed in it.
Which troubled me much, and Creed by and by comes, and after dinner
he did, but in the most cunning ingenious manner, do his business with
Creed by bringing it in by the by, that the most subtile man in the
world could never have done it better, and I must say that he is a
most witty, cunning man and one that I (am) most afeard of in my
conversation, though in all serious matters of business the eeriest
foole that ever I met with. The bill was produced and a copy given
Creed, whereupon he wrote his Intratur upon the originall, and I hope
it will pass, at least I am now put to it that I must stand by it
and justify it, but I pray God it may never come to that test. Thence
between vexed and joyed, not knowing what yet to make of it, home,
calling for my Lord Cooke’s 3 volumes at my bookseller’s, and so home,
where I found a new cook mayd, her name is-----that promises very
little. So to my office, where late about drawing up a proposal for
Captain Taylor, for him to deliver to the City about his building the
new ship, which I have done well, and I hope will do the business, and
so home to supper and to bed.
