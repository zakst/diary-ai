6th. Up, and to the office, where very busy all the morning. We met
upon a report to the Duke of Yorke of the debts of the Navy, which we
finished by three o’clock, and having eat one little bit of meate, I by
water before the rest to White Hall (and they to come after me) because
of a Committee for Tangier, where I did my business of stating my
accounts perfectly well, and to good liking, and do not discern, but
the Duke of Albemarle is my friend in his intentions notwithstanding my
general fears. After that to our Navy business, where my fellow officers
were called in, and did that also very well, and then broke up, and I
home by coach, Tooker with me, and staid in Lumbard Streete at Viner’s,
and sent home for the plate which my wife and I had a mind to change,
and there changed it, about L50 worth, into things more usefull, whereby
we shall now have a very handsome cupboard of plate. So home to the
office, wrote my letters by the post, and to bed.
