19th. Up and to the office, where Mr. Coventry and Sir W. Pen and I sat
all the morning hiring of ships to go to Guinny, where we believe the
warr with Holland will first break out. At noon dined at home, and after
dinner my wife and I to Sir W. Pen’s, to see his Lady, the first time,
who is a well-looked, fat, short, old Dutchwoman, but one that hath been
heretofore pretty handsome, and is now very discreet, and, I believe,
hath more wit than her husband. Here we staid talking a good while, and
very well pleased I was with the old woman at first visit. So away home,
and I to my office, my wife to go see my aunt Wight, newly come to town.
Creed came to me, and he and I out, among other things, to look out a
man to make a case, for to keep my stone, that I was cut of, in, and he
to buy Daniel’s history, which he did, but I missed of my end. So parted
upon Ludgate Hill, and I home and to the office, where busy till supper,
and home to supper to a good dish of fritters, which I bespoke, and were
done much to my mind. Then to the office a while again, and so home
to bed. The newes of the Emperour’s victory over the Turkes is by some
doubted, but by most confessed to be very small (though great) of what
was talked, which was 80,000 men to be killed and taken of the Turke’s
side.
