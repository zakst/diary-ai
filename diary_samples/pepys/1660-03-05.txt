5th. Early in the morning Mr. Hill comes to string my theorbo,

     [The theorbo was a bass lute.  Having gut strings it was played with
     the fingers.  There is a humorous comparison of the long waists of
     ladies, which came into fashion about 1621, with the theorbo, by
     Bishop Corbet:

         “She was barr’d up in whale-bones, that did leese
          None of the whale’s length, for they reached her knees;
          Off with her head, and then she hath a middle
          As her waste stands, just like the new found fiddle,
          The favourite Theorbo, truth to tell ye,
          Whose neck and throat are deeper than the belly.”

                                   Corbet, ‘Iter Boreale’.]

which we were about till past ten o’clock, with a great deal of
pleasure. Then to Westminster, where I met with Mr. Sheply and Mr.
Pinkney at Will’s, who took me by water to Billingsgate, at the
Salutation Tavern, whither by-and-by, Mr. Talbot and Adams came, and
bring a great [deal of] good meat, a ham of bacon, &c. Here we staid
and drank till Mr. Adams began to be overcome. Then we parted, and so to
Westminster by water, only seeing Mr. Pinkney at his own house, where he
shewed me how he had alway kept the Lion and Unicorn, in the back of his
chimney, bright, in expectation of the King’s coming again. At home
I found Mr. Hunt, who told me how the Parliament had voted that the
Covenant be printed and hung in churches again. Great hopes of the
King’s coming again. To bed.
