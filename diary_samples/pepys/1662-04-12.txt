12th. Up betimes and to my office, and up to my workmen, which goes on
slowly and troubles me much. Besides, my mind is troubled till I see how
Sir John Minnes will carry himself to me about my lodgings, for all my
fear is that he will get my best chamber from me, for as for the leads
I care not a farthing for them. At my office all the morning, Mr. Lewes
teaching me to understand the method of making up Purser’s accounts,
which is very needful for me and very hard. Dined at home all in dirt,
and my mind weary of being thus out of order, but I hope in God it will
away, but for the present I am very melancholy, as I have been a great
while. All the afternoon till 9 at night at my office, and then home
and eat an egg or two, and so to my lodgings and to bed. This day, by
letters from my father, I hear that Captain Ferrers, who is with my Lord
in the country, was at Brampton (with Mr. Creed) to see him; and that a
day or two ago, being provoked to strike one of my Lord’s footmen, the
footman drew his sword, and hath almost cut the fingers of one of his
hands off; which I am sorry for: but this is the vanity of being apt to
command and strike.
