8th. Up, and to the office all the morning. At noon dined at home, my
wifeâ€™s cheek bad still. After dinner to the office again and thither
comes Mr. Downing, the anchor-smith, who had given me 50 pieces in gold
the last month to speake for him to Sir W. Coventry, for his being smith
at Deptford; but after I had got it granted to him, he finds himself not
fit to go on with it, so lets it fall. So has no benefit of my motion. I
therefore in honour and conscience took him home the money, and, though
much to my grief, did yet willingly and forcibly force him to take it
again, the poor man having no mind to have it. However, I made him take
it, and away he went, and I glad to have given him so much cause to
speake well of me. So to my office again late, and then home to supper
to a good lobster with my wife, and then a little to my office again,
and so to bed.
