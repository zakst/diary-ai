5th (Lordâ€™s day). About one in the morning I was knocked up by my mayds
to come to my wife who is very ill. I rose, and from some cold she got
to-day, or from something else, she is taken with great gripings, a
looseness, and vomiting. I lay a while by her upon the bed, she being
in great pain, poor wretch, but that being a little over I to bed again,
and lay, and then up and to my office all the morning, setting matters
to rights in some accounts and papers, and then to dinner, whither
Mr. Shepley, late come to town, came to me, and after dinner and
some pleasant discourse he went his way, being to go out of town
to Huntington again to-morrow. So all the afternoon with my wife
discoursing and talking, and in the evening to my office doing business,
and then home to supper and to bed.
