10th. Up and to my house, and there contrived a way how Sir John Minnes
shall come into the leads, and yet I save part of the closet I hoped
for, which, if it will not please him, I am a madman to be troubled at
it. To my office, and then at my house among my lazy workmen all day. In
the afternoon to the Wardrobe to speak with Mr. Townsend, who tells me
that he has spoke with Mr. Young about my brother Tom’s business, and
finds that he has made enquiry of him, and do hear him so well spoken of
that he doubts not that the business will take with ordinary endeavours.
So to my brother’s, and there finding both door and hatch open, I went
in and knocked 3 or 4 times, and nobody came to me, which troubled me
mightily; at last came Margaret, who complained of Peter, who by and
by came in, and I did rattle him soundly for it. I did afterwards
take occasion to talk seriously alone with Margaret, who I find a very
discreet, good woman, and tells me, upon my demand, that her master is a
very good husband, and minds his business well, but his fault is that he
has not command over his two men, but they do what they list, and care
not for his commands, and especially on Sundays they go whither they
please, and not to church, which vexes me mightily, and I am resolved to
school [him] soundly for it, it being so much unlike my father, that I
cannot endure it in myself or him. So walked home and in my way at the
Exchange found my uncle Wight, and he and I to an alehouse to drink a
cup of beer, and so away, and I home and at the office till 9 o’clock
and past, and so to my lodgings. I forgot that last night Mr. Cooke
came to me to make his peace for inviting my brother lately out of town
without my leave, but he do give me such a character of the lady that
he has found out for him that I do much rejoice at, and did this night
write a letter to her, which he enclosed in one of his, and by the
report that I hear of her I confess I am much pleased with the match.
