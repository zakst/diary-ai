15th. Up, and at the Office all the morning. Dined at home and Creed
with me home, and I did discourse about evening some reckonings with him
in the afternoon; but I could not, for my eyes, do it, which troubled
me, and vexed him that would not; but yet we were friends, I advancing
him more without it, and so to walk all the afternoon together in
the garden; and I perceive still he do expect a change in of matters,
especially as to religion, and fits himself for it by professing himself
for it in his discourse. He gone, I to my business at my Office, and so
at night home to supper, and to bed.
