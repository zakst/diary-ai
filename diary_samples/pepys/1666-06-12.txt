12th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon to
dinner, and then to White Hall in hopes of a meeting of Tangier about
Yeabsly’s business, but it could not be obtained, Sir G. Carteret nor
Sir W. Coventry being able to be there, which still vexes [me] to see
the poor man forced still to attend, as also being desirous to see
what my profit is, and get it. Walking here in the galleries I find the
Ladies of Honour dressed in their riding garbs, with coats and doublets
with deep skirts, just for all the world like mine, and buttoned their
doublets up the breast, with perriwigs and with hats; so that, only for
a long petticoat dragging under their men’s coats, nobody could take
them for women in any point whatever; which was an odde sight, and a
sight did not please me. It was Mrs. Wells and another fine lady that I
saw thus. Thence down by water to Deptford, and there late seeing some
things dispatched down to the fleete, and so home (thinking indeed to
have met with Bagwell, but I did not) to write my letters very late, and
so to supper and to bed.
