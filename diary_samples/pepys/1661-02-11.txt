Exchequer, and took Mr. Warren with me to Mr. Kennard, the master
joiner, at Whitehall, who was at a tavern, and there he and I to him,
and agreed about getting some of my Lord’s deals on board to-morrow.
Then with young Mr. Reeve home to his house, who did there show me many
pretty pleasures in perspectives,

mother did, and so with him to Mr. Adam Chard’s’ (the first time I ever
was at his house since he was married) to drink, then we parted, and I
home to my study, and set some papers and money in order, and so to bed.
