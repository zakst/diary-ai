6th. Up betimes and did much business before office time. Then to the
office and there till noon and so home to dinner and to the office again
till night. In the evening being at Sir W. Batten’s, stepped in (for I
have not used to go thither a good while), I find my Lord Bruncker and
Mrs. Williams, and they would of their own accord, though I had never
obliged them (nor my wife neither) with one visit for many of theirs, go
see my house and my wife; which I showed them and made them welcome with
wine and China oranges (now a great rarity since the war, none to be
had). There being also Captain Cocke and Mrs. Turner, who had never been
in my house since I come to the office before, and Mrs. Carcasse, wife
of Mr. Carcasses. My house happened to be mighty clean, and did me great
honour, and they mightily pleased with it. They gone I to the office and
did some business, and then home to supper and to bed. My mind
troubled through a doubtfulness of my having incurred Sir W. Coventry’s
displeasure by not having waited on him since his coming to towne, which
is a mighty faulte and that I can bear the fear of the bad effects of
till I have been with him, which shall be to-morrow, God willing. So to
bed.
