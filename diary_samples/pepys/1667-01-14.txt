14th. Up, and to the office, where busy getting beforehand with my
business as fast as I can. At noon home to dinner, and presently
afterward at my office again. I understand my father is pretty well
again, blessed be God! and would have my Br[other] John comedown to him
for a little while. Busy till night, pleasing myself mightily to see
what a deal of business goes off of a man’s hands when he stays by it,
and then, at night, before it was late (yet much business done) home to
supper, discourse with my wife, and to bed. Sir W. Batten tells me the
Lords do agree at last with the Commons about the word “Nuisance” in the
Irish Bill, and do desire a good correspondence between the two Houses;
and that the King do intend to prorogue them the last of this month.
