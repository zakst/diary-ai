18th (Saturday). Up, and my bookseller brought home books, bound--the
binding comes to 17s. Advanced to my maid Bridget L1. Sir W. Pen at the
Office, seemingly merry. Do hear this morning that Harman is committed
by the Parliament last night, the day he come up, which is hard; but
he took all upon himself first, and then when a witness come in to say
otherwise, he would have retracted; and the House took it so ill, they
would commit him. Thence home to dinner with my clerks, and so to White
Hall by water, 1s., and there a short Committee for Tangier, and so I to
the King’s playhouse, 1s., and to the play of the “Duke of Lerma,” 2s.
