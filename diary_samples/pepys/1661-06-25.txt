25th. Up this morning to put my papers in order that are come from my
Lord’s, so that now I have nothing there remaining that is mine, which I
have had till now. This morning came Mr. Goodgroome

     [Theodore Goodgroome, Pepys’s singing-master.  He was probably
     related to John Goodgroome, a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, who is
     also referred to in the Diary.]

to me (recommended by Mr. Mage), with whom I agreed presently to give
him 20s. entrance, which I then did, and 20s. a month more to teach me
to sing, and so we began, and I hope I have come to something in it. His
first song is “La cruda la bella.” He gone my brother Tom comes, with
whom I made even with my father and the two drapers for the cloths I
sent to sea lately. At home all day, in the afternoon came Captain
Allen and his daughter Rebecca and Mr. Hempson, and by and by both Sir
Williams, who sat with me till it was late, and I had a very gallant
collation for them. At night to bed.
