19th. Up, and to my accounts again, and stated them very clear and fair,
and at noon dined at my lodgings with Mr. Hater and W. Hewer at table
with me, I being come to an agreement yesterday with my landlady for L6
per month, for so many rooms for myself, them, and my wife and mayde,
when she shall come, and to pay besides for my dyett. After dinner I did
give them my accounts and letters to write against I went to the Duke of
Albemarle’s this evening, which I did; and among other things, spoke to
him for my wife’s brother, Balty, to be of his guard, which he kindly
answered that he should. My business of the Victualling goes on as I
would have it; and now my head is full how to make some profit of it to
myself or people. To that end, when I came home, I wrote a letter to
Mr. Coventry, offering myself to be the Surveyor Generall, and am apt
to think he will assist me in it, but I do not set my heart much on it,
though it would be a good helpe. So back to my office, and there till
past one before I could get all these letters and papers copied out,
which vexed me, but so sent them away without hopes of saving the post,
and so to my lodging to bed.
