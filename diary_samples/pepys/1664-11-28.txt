28th. Up, and with Sir J. Minnes and W. Batten to White Hall, but no
Committee of Lords (which is like to do the King’s business well). So to
Westminster, and there to Jervas’s and was a little while with Jane, and
so to London by coach and to the Coffee-house, where certain news of our
peace made by Captain Allen with Argier, which is good news; and that
the Dutch have sent part of their fleete round by Scotland; and resolve
to pay off the rest half-pay, promising the rest in the Spring, hereby
keeping their men. But how true this, I know not. Home to dinner, then
come Dr. Clerke to speak with me about sick and wounded men, wherein he
is like to be concerned. After him Mr. Cutler, and much talk with him,
and with him to White Hall, to have waited on the Lords by order, but
no meeting, neither to-night, which will spoil all. I think I shall get
something by my discourse with Cutler. So home, and after being at my
office an hour with Mr. Povy talking about his business of Tangier,
getting him some money allowed him for freight of ships, wherein I hope
to get something too. He gone, home hungry and almost sick for want of
eating, and so to supper and to bed.
