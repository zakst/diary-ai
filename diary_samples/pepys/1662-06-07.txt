7th. To the office, where all the morning, and I find Mr. Coventry is
resolved to do much good, and to enquire into all the miscarriages of
the office. At noon with him and Sir W. Batten to dinner at Trinity
House; where, among others, Sir J. Robinson, Lieutenant of the Tower,
was, who says that yesterday Sir H. Vane had a full hearing at the
King’s Bench, and is found guilty; and that he did never hear any man
argue more simply than he in all his life, and so others say. My mind
in great trouble whether I should go as I intended to Hampton Court
to-morrow or no. At last resolved the contrary, because of the charge
thereof, and I am afraid now to bring in any accounts for journeys, and
so will others I suppose be, because of Mr. Coventry’s prying into them.
Thence sent for to Sir G. Carteret’s, and there talked with him a good
while. I perceive, as he told me, were it not that Mr. Coventry had
already feathered his nest in selling of places, he do like him very
well, and hopes great good from him. But he complains so of lack of
money, that my heart is very sad, under the apprehension of the fall of
the office. At my office all the afternoon, and at night hear that my
father is gone into the country, but whether to Richmond as he intended,
and thence to meet us at Hampton Court on Monday, I know not, or to
Brampton. At which I am much troubled. In the evening home and to bed.
