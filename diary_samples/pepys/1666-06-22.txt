22nd. Up, and before I went out Mr. Peter Barr sent me a tierce of
claret, which is very welcome. And so abroad down the river to Deptford
and there did some business, and then to Westminster, and there did
with much ado get my tallys (my small ones instead of one great one of
L2,000), and so away home and there all day upon my Tangier accounts
with Creed, and, he being gone, with myself, in settling other accounts
till past twelve at night, and then every body being in bed, I to bed,
my father, wife, and sister late abroad upon the water, and Mercer
being gone to her motherâ€™s and staid so long she could not get into the
office, which vexed me.
