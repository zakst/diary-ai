which the oftener I read the more I admire. There found Captain Cocke,
and up and down to many places to look after matters, and so walked back
again with him to his house, and there dined very finely. With much ado
obtained an excuse from drinking of wine, and did only taste a drop of
Sack which he had for his lady, who is, he fears, a little consumptive,
and her beauty begins to want its colour. It was Malago Sack, which, he
says, is certainly 30 years old, and I tasted a drop of it, and it was
excellent wine, like a spirit rather than wine. Thence by water to the
office, and taking some papers by water to White Hall and St. James’s,
but there being no meeting with the Duke to-day, I returned by water and
down to Greenwich, to look after some blocks that I saw a load carried
off by a cart from Woolwich, the King’s Yard. But I could not find them,
and so returned, and being heartily weary I made haste to bed, and being
in bed made Will read and construe three or four Latin verses in the
Bible, and chide him for forgetting his grammar. So to sleep, and sleep
ill all the night, being so weary, and feverish with it.
