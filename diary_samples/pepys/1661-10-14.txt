14th. This morning I ventured by water abroad to Westminster, but lost
my labour, for Mr. Montagu was not in town. So to the Wardrobe, and
there dined with my Lady, which is the first time I have seen her dine
abroad since her being brought to bed of my Lady Katherine. In the
afternoon Captain Ferrers and I walked abroad to several places, among
others to Mr. Pim’s, my Lord’s Taylour’s, and there he went out with us
to the Fountain tavern and did give us store of wine, and it being the
Duke of York’s birthday, we drank the more to his health. But, Lord!
what a sad story he makes of his being abused by a Dr. of Physique who
is in one part of the tenement wherein he dwells. It would make one
laugh, though I see he is under a great trouble in it. Thence home by
link and found a good answer from my father that Sir R. Bernard do clear
all things as to us and our title to Brampton, which puts my heart in
great ease and quiet.
