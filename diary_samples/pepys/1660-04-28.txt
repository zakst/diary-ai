28th. This morning sending a packet by Mr. Dunne to London. In the
afternoon I played at ninepins with Mr. Pickering, I and Mr. Pett
against him and Ted Osgood, and won a crown apiece of him. He had not
money enough to pay me. After supper my Lord exceeding merry, and he and
I and W. Howe to sing, and so to bed.
