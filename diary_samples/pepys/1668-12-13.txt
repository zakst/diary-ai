13th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and with W. Hewer to the Office, where all the
morning, and then home to a little dinner, and presently to it again all
alone till twelve at night, drawing up my answer to Middleton, which
I think I shall do to very good purpose--at least, I satisfy myself
therein; and so to bed, weary with walking in my Office dictating to him
[Hewer]. In the night my wife very ill, vomited, but was well again by
and by.
