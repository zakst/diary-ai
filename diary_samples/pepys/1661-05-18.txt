18th. Towards Westminster, from the Towre, by water, and was fain to
stand upon one of the piers about the bridge,

     [The dangers of shooting the bridge were so great that a popular
     proverb has it--London Bridge was made for wise men to go over and
     fools to go under.]

before the men could drag their boat through the lock, and which they
could not do till another was called to help them. Being through bridge
I found the Thames full of boats and gallys, and upon inquiry found that
there was a wager to be run this morning. So spying of Payne in a gully,
I went into him, and there staid, thinking to have gone to Chelsy with
them. But upon, the start, the wager boats fell foul one of another,
till at last one of them gives over, pretending foul play, and so the
other row away alone, and all our sport lost. So, I went ashore, at
Westminster; and to the Hall I went, where it was very pleasant to see
the Hall in the condition it is now with the judges on the benches at
the further end of it, which I had not seen all this term till now.
Thence with Mr. Spicer, Creed and some others to drink. And so away
homewards by water with Mr. Creed, whom I left in London going about
business and I home, where I staid all the afternoon in the garden
reading “Faber Fortunae” with great pleasure. So home to bed.
