12th. With Colonel Slingsby and a friend of his, Major Waters (a deaf
and most amorous melancholy gentleman, who is under a despayr in love,
as the Colonel told me, which makes him bad company, though a most
good-natured man), by water to Redriffe, and so on foot to Deptford (our
servants by water), where we fell to choosing four captains to command
the guards, and choosing the places where to keep them, and other things
in order thereunto. We dined at the Globe, having our messenger with us
to take care for us. Never till now did I see the great authority of my
place, all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us. Having
staid very late there talking with the Colonel, I went home with Mr.
Davis, storekeeper (whose wife is ill and so I could not see her), and
was there most prince-like lodged, with so much respect and honour that
I was at a loss how to behave myself.
