20th (Lordâ€™s day). To Church in the morning. Dined at home. My wife
and I to Church in the afternoon, and that being done we went to see my
uncle and aunt Wight. There I left my wife and came back, and sat with
Sir W. Pen, who is not yet well again. Thence back again to my wife
and supped there, and were very merry and so home, and after prayers to
write down my journall for the last five days, and so to bed.
