22d (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed and went not out all day; but after
dinner to Sir W. Batten’s and Sir W. Pen’s, where discoursing much of
yesterday’s trouble and scandal; but that which troubled me most was
Sir J. Minnes coming from Court at night, and instead of bringing great
comfort from thence (but I expected no better from him), he tells me
that the Duke and Mr. Coventry make no great matter of it. So at night
discontented to prayers, and to bed.
