19th. At the office all the morning, and at noon Mr. Coventry, who sat
with us all the morning, and Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Pen, and myself,.
by coach to Captain Marshe’s, at Limehouse, to a house that hath been
their ancestors for this 250 years, close by the lime-house which gives
the name to the place. Here they have a design to get the King to hire
a dock for the herring busses, which is now the great design on foot, to
lie up in. We had a very good and handsome dinner, and excellent wine.
I not being neat in clothes, which I find a great fault in me, could not
be so merry as otherwise, and at all times I am and can be, when I am
in good habitt, which makes me remember my father Osborne’s’ rule for a
gentleman to spare in all things rather than in that. So by coach home,
and so to write letters by post, and so to bed.
