15th (Lord’s day). Up and with my wife and her woman Ashwell the first
time to church, where our pew was so full with Sir J. Minnes’s sister
and her daughter, that I perceive, when we come all together, some of us
must be shut out, but I suppose we shall come to some order what to do
therein. Dined at home, and to church again in the afternoon, and so
home, and I to my office till the evening doing one thing or other and
reading my vows as I am bound every Lord’s day, and so home to supper
and talk, and Ashwell is such good company that I think we shall be very
lucky in her. So to prayers and to bed. This day the weather, which of
late has been very hot and fair, turns very wet and cold, and all the
church time this afternoon it thundered mightily, which I have not heard
a great while.
