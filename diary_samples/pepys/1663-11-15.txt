15th (Lord’s day). Lay very long in bed with my wife and then up and to
my office there to copy fair my letter to Sir G. Carteret, which I did,
and by and by most opportunely a footman of his came to me about other
business, and so I sent it him by his own servant. I wish good luck with
it. At noon home to dinner, my wife not being up, she lying to expect
Mr. Holyard the surgeon. So I dined by myself, and in the afternoon to
my office again, and there drew up a letter to my Lord, stating to him
what the world talks concerning him, and leaving it to him and myself to
be thought of by him as he pleases, but I have done but my duty in it.
I wait Mr. Moore’s coming for his advice about sending it. So home
to supper to my wife, myself finding myself by cold got last night
beginning to have some pain, which grieves me much in my mind to see
to what a weakness I am come. This day being our Queene’s birthday, the
guns of the Tower went all off; and in the evening the Lord Mayor sent
from church to church to order the constables to cause bonfires to be
made in every streete, which methinks is a poor thing to be forced to
be commanded. After a good supper with my wife, and hearing of the mayds
read in the Bible, we to prayers, and to bed.
