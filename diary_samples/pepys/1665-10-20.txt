20th. Up, and had my last nightâ€™s letters brought back to me, which
troubles me, because of my accounts, lest they should be asked for
before they come, which I abhorr, being more ready to give than they can
be to demand them: so I sent away an expresse to Oxford with them, and
another to Portsmouth, with a copy of my letter to Mr. Coventry about
my victualling business, for fear he should be gone from Oxford, as he
intended, thither. So busy all the morning and at noon to Cocke, and
dined there. He and I alone, vexed that we are not rid of all our
trouble about our goods, but it is almost over, and in the afternoon
to my lodging, and there spent the whole afternoon and evening with Mr.
Hater, discoursing of the business of the office, where he tells me that
among others Thomas Willson do now and then seem to hint that I do take
too much business upon me, more than I can do, and that therefore some
do lie undone. This I confess to my trouble is true, but it arises from
my being forced to take so much on me, more than is my proper task to
undertake. But for this at last I did advise to him to take another
clerk if he thinks fit, I will take care to have him paid. I discoursed
also much with him about persons fit to be put into the victualling
business, and such as I could spare something out of their salaries for
them, but without trouble I cannot, I see, well do it, because Thomas
Willson must have the refusal of the best place which is London of L200
per annum, which I did intend for Tooker, and to get L50 out of it as
a help to Mr. Hater. How[ever], I will try to do something of this kind
for them. Having done discourse with him late, I to enter my Tangier
accounts fair, and so to supper and to bed.
