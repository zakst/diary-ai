8th. Up, and with Colonel Middleton, in his coach, and Mr. Tippets to
White Hall; and there attended the Duke of York with the rest, where the
Duke was mighty plain with the Treasurers, according to the advice my
Lord Brouncker and I did give him the other night, and he did it fully;
and so as, I believe, will make the Treasurers carefull of themselves,
unless they do resolve upon defying the Duke of York. Thence with W.
Hewer home, and to dinner, and so out again, my wife and I and Mr. Hater
to White Hall, where she set us down, and she up and down to buy things,
while we at the Treasury-Chamber, where I alone did manage the business
of “The Leopard” against the whole Committee of the East India Company,
with Mr. Blackburne with them; and to the silencing of them all, to my
no great content. Thence walked to my wife, and so set out for home
in our coach, it being very cold weather, and so to the office to do a
little business, and then home to my wife’s chamber, my people having
laid the cloth, and got the rooms all clean above-stairs to-night for
our dinner to-morrow, and therefore I to bed.
