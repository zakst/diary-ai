11th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, where some
discourse arose from Sir G. Carteret and Mr. Coventry, which gives me
occasion to think that something like a war is expected now indeed,
though upon the ‘Change afterwards I hear too that an Embassador is
landed from Holland, and one from their East India Company, to treat
with ours about the wrongs we pretend to. Mr. Creed dined with me, and
thence after dinner by coach with my wife only to take the ayre, it
being very warm and pleasant, to Bowe and Old Ford; and thence to
Hackney. There ‘light, and played at shuffle-board, eat cream and good
churies; and so with good refreshment home. Then to my office vexed with
Captain Taylor about the delay of carrying down the ship hired by me for
Tangier, and late about that and other things at the office. So home to
supper and to bed.
