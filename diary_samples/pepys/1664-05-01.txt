May 1st (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed. Went not to church, but staid at
home to examine my last night’s accounts, which I find right, and that
I am L908 creditor in the world, the same I was last month. Dined, and
after dinner down by water with my wife and Besse with great pleasure
as low as Greenwich and so back, playing as it were leisurely upon the
water to Deptford, where I landed and sent my wife up higher to land
below Half-way house. I to the King’s yard and there spoke about several
businesses with the officers, and so with Mr. Wayth consulting about
canvas, to Half-way house where my wife was, and after eating there we
broke and walked home before quite dark. So to supper, prayers, and to
bed.
