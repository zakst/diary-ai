4th. Up and to the office, where after a while sitting, I left the board
upon pretence of serious business, and by coach to Paul’s School, where
I heard some good speeches of the boys that were to be elected
this year. Thence by and by with Mr. Pullen and Barnes (a great
Non-Conformist) with several others of my old acquaintance to the Nag’s
Head Taverne, and there did give them a bottle of sacke, and away again
and I to the School, and up to hear the upper form examined; and
there was kept by very many of the Mercers, Clutterbucke, a Barker,
Harrington, and others; and with great respect used by them all, and
had a noble dinner. Here they tell me, that in Dr. Colett’s will he says
that he would have a Master found for the School that hath good skill in
Latin, and (if it could be) one that had some knowledge of the Greeke;
so little was Greeke known here at that time. Dr. Wilkins and one Mr.
Smallwood, Posers. After great pleasure there, and specially to Mr.
Crumlum, so often to tell of my being a benefactor to the School, I to
my bookseller’s and there spent an hour looking over Theatrum Urbium
and Flandria illustrata, with excellent cuts, with great content. So
homeward, and called at my little milliner’s, where I chatted with her,
her husband out of the way, and a mad merry slut she is. So home to
the office, and by and by comes my wife home from the burial of Captain
Grove’s wife at Wapping (she telling me a story how her mayd Jane going
into the boat did fall down and show her arse in the boat), and alone
comes my uncle Wight and Mr. Maes with the state of their case, which he
told me very discreetly, and I believe is a very hard one, and so after
drinking a bottle of ale or two they gone, and I a little more to the
office, and so home to prayers and to bed. This evening I made an end of
my letter to Creed about his pieces of eight, and sent it away to him.
I pray God give good end to it to bring me some money, and that duly as
from him.
