5th. To the Privy Seal this morning about business, in my way taking
leave of my mother, who goes to Brampton to-day. But doing my business
at the Privy Seal pretty soon, I took boat and went to my uncle
Fenner’s, and there I found my mother and my wife and Pall (of whom I
had this morning at my own house taken leave, and given her 20s. and
good counsel how to carry herself to my father and mother), and so I
took them, it being late, to Beard’s, where they were staid for, and so
I put them into the waggon, and saw them going presently, Pall crying
exceedingly. Then in with my wife, my aunt Bell and Charles Pepys, whom
we met there, and drank, and so to my uncle Fenner’s to dinner (in the
way meeting a French footman with feathers, who was in quest of my wife,
and spoke with her privately, but I could not tell what it was, only my
wife promised to go to some place to-morrow morning, which do trouble
my mind how to know whither it was), where both his sons and daughters
were, and there we were merry and dined. After dinner news was brought
that my aunt Kite, the butcher’s widow in London, is sick ready to die
and sends for my uncle and me to come to take charge of things, and to
be entrusted with the care of her daughter. But I through want of time
to undertake such a business, I was taken up by Antony Joyce, which
came at last to very high words, which made me very angry, and I did
not think that he would ever have been such a fool to meddle with other
people’s business, but I saw he spoke worse to his father than to me and
therefore I bore it the better, but all the company was offended with
him, so we parted angry he and I, and so my wife and I to the fair,
and I showed her the Italians dancing the ropes, and the women that
do strange tumbling tricks and so by foot home vexed in my mind about
Antony Joyce.
