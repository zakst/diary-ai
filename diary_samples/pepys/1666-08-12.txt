12th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and to my chamber, where busy all the morning, and
my thoughts very much upon the manner of my removal of my closett things
the next weeke into my present musique room, if I find I can spare or
get money to furnish it. By and by comes Reeves, by appointment, but
did not bring the glasses and things I expected for our discourse and my
information to-day, but we have agreed on it for next Sunday. By and
by, in comes Betty Michell and her husband, and so to dinner, I mightily
pleased with their company. We passed the whole day talking with them,
but without any pleasure, but only her being there. In the evening, all
parted, and I and my wife up to her closett to consider how to order
that the next summer, if we live to it; and then down to my chamber at
night to examine her kitchen accounts, and there I took occasion to fall
out with her for her buying a laced handkercher and pinner without my
leave. Though the thing is not much, yet I would not permit her begin
to do so, lest worse should follow. From this we began both to be angry,
and so continued till bed, and did not sleep friends.
