4th. At home all the morning; in the afternoon I went to the Theatre,
and there I saw “Claracilla” (the first time I ever saw it), well acted.
But strange to see this house, that used to be so thronged, now empty
since the Opera begun; and so will continue for a while, I believe.
Called at my father’s, and there I heard that my uncle Robert--[Robert
Pepys, of Brampton, who died on the following day.]--continues to have
his fits of stupefaction every day for 10 or 12 hours together. From
thence to the Exchange at night, and then went with my uncle Wight to
the Mitre and were merry, but he takes it very ill that my father would
go out of town to Brampton on this occasion and would not tell him of
it, which I endeavoured to remove but could not. Here Mr. Batersby
the apothecary was, who told me that if my uncle had the
emerods--[Haemorrhoids or piles.]--(which I think he had) and that now
they are stopped, he will lay his life that bleeding behind by leeches
will cure him, but I am resolved not to meddle in it. Home and to bed.
