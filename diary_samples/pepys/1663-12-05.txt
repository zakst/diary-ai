5th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and then with
the whole board, viz., Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, and myself along
with Captain Allen home to dinner, where he lives hard by in Mark Lane,
where we had a very good plain dinner and good welcome, in a pretty
little house but so smoky that it was troublesome to us all till they
put out the fire, and made one of charcoale. I was much pleased with
this dinner for the many excellent stories told by Mr. Coventry, which I
have put down in my book of tales and so shall not mention them here. We
staid till night, and then Mr. Coventry away, and by and by I home to
my office till 9 or 10 at night, and so home to supper and to bed after
some talke and Arithmetique with my poor wife, with whom now-a-days I
live with great content, out of all trouble of mind by jealousy (for
which God forgive me), or any other distraction more than my fear of my
Lord Sandwichâ€™s displeasure.
