5th. Up, and by water to White Hall, where did a little business with
the Duke of York at our usual attending him, and thence to my wife, who
was with my coach at Unthanke’s, though not very well of those upon her,
and so home to dinner, and after dinner I to the Tower, where I find
Sir W. Coventry with abundance of company with him; and after sitting
awhile, and hearing some merry discourse, and, among others, of Mr.
Brouncker’s being this day summoned to Sir William Morton, one of the
judges, to give in security for his good behaviour, upon his words the
other day to Sir John Morton, a Parliament-man, at White Hall, who had
heretofore spoke very highly against Brouncker in the House, I away,
and to Aldgate, and walked forward towards White Chapel, till my wife
overtook me with the coach, it being a mighty fine afternoon; and there
we went the first time out of town with our coach and horses, and went
as far as Bow, the spring beginning a little now to appear, though the
way be dirty; and so, with great pleasure, with the fore-part of our
coach up, we spent the afternoon. And so in the evening home, and there
busy at the Office awhile, and so to bed, mightily pleased with being at
peace with my poor wife, and with the pleasure we may hope to have with
our coach this summer, when the weather comes to be good.
