21st, All the morning putting things in my house in order, and packing
up glass to send into the country to my father, and books to my brother
John, and then to my Lord Crew’s to dinner; and thence to Mr. Lewes
Philip’s chamber, and there at noon with him for business, and received
L80 upon Jaspar Trice’s account, and so home with it, and so to my
chamber for all this evening, and then to bed.
