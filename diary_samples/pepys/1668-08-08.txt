8th. Up, and I walked out, and met Uncle Wight, whom I sent to last
night, and Mr. Wight coming to see us, and I walked with them back to
see my aunt at Katherine Hill, and there walked up and down the hill and
places, about: but a dull place, but good ayre, and the house dull. But
here I saw my aunt, after many days not seeing her--I think, a year or
two; and she walked with me to see my wife. And here, at the Red Lyon,
we all dined together, and mighty merry, and then parted: and we home
to Fox Hall, where Fitzgerald and I â€˜light, and by water to White Hall,
where the Duke of York being abroad, I by coach and met my wife, who
went round, and after doing at the office a little, and finding all well
at home, I to bed. I hear that Colbert, the French Ambassador, is come,
and hath been at Court incognito. When he hath his audience, I know not.
