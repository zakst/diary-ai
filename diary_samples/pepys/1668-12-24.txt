24th. A cold day. Up, and to the Office, where all the morning alone at
the Office, nobody meeting, being the eve of Christmas. At noon home
to dinner, and then to the Office busy, all the afternoon, and at night
home to supper, and it being now very cold, and in hopes of a frost, I
begin this night to put on a waistcoat, it being the first winter in my
whole memory that ever I staid till this day before I did so. So to bed
in mighty good humour with my wife, but sad, in one thing, and that is
for my poor eyes.
