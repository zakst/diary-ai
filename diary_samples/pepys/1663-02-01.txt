February 1st (Lord’s day). Up and to church, where Mr. Mills, a good
sermon, and so home and had a good dinner with my wife, with which I was
pleased to see it neatly done, and this troubled me to think of parting
with Jane, that is come to be a very good cook. After dinner walked to
my Lord Sandwich, and staid with him in the chamber talking almost all
the afternoon, he being not yet got abroad since his sickness. Many
discourses we had; but, among others, how Sir R. Bernard is turned out
of his Recordership of Huntingdon by the Commissioners for Regulation,
&c., at which I am troubled, because he, thinking it is done by my Lord
Sandwich, will act some of his revenge, it is likely, upon me in my
business, so that I must cast about me to get some other counsel to rely
upon. In the evening came Mr. Povey and others to see my Lord, and they
gone, my Lord and I and Povey fell to the business of Tangier, as to
the victualling, and so broke up, and I, it being a fine frost, my boy
lighting me I walked home, and after supper up to prayers, and then
alone with my wife and Jane did fall to tell her what I did expect would
become of her since, after so long being my servant, she had carried
herself so as to make us be willing to put her away, and desired God to
bless [her], but bid her never to let me hear what became of her,
for that I could never pardon ingratitude. So I to bed, my mind
much troubled for the poor girl that she leaves us, and yet she not
submitting herself, for some words she spoke boldly and yet I believe
innocently and out of familiarity to her mistress about us weeks ago, I
could not recall my words that she should stay with me. This day Creed
and I walking in White Hall garden did see the King coming privately
from my Lady Castlemaine’s; which is a poor thing for a Prince to do;
and I expressed my sense of it to Creed in terms which I should not have
done, but that I believe he is trusty in that point.
