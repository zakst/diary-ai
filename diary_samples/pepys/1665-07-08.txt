8th. All day very diligent at the office, ended my letters by 9 at
night, and then fitted myself to go down to Woolwich to my wife, which
I did, calling at Sir G. Carteret’s at Deptford, and there hear that
my Lady Sandwich is come, but not very well. By 12 o’clock to Woolwich,
found my wife asleep in bed, but strange to think what a fine night I
had down, but before I had been one minute on shore, the mightiest storm
come of wind and rain that almost could be for a quarter of an houre
and so left. I to bed, being the first time I come to her lodgings, and
there lodged well.
