4th. Up, and to the office, and then my wife being gone to see her
mother at Deptford, I before the office sat went to the Excise Office,
and thence being alone stepped into Duck Lane, and thence tried to have
sent a porter to Deb.’s, but durst not trust him, and therefore having
bought a book to satisfy the bookseller for my stay there, a 12d. book,
Andronicus of Tom Fuller, I took coach, and at the end of Jewen Street
next Red Cross Street I sent the coachman to her lodging, and understand
she is gone for Greenwich to one Marys’s, a tanner’s, at which I, was
glad, hoping to have opportunity to find her out; and so, in great fear
of being seen, I to the office, and there all the morning, dined at
home, and presently after dinner comes home my wife, who I believe is
jealous of my spending the day, and I had very good fortune in being at
home, for if Deb. had been to have been found it is forty to one but I
had been abroad, God forgive me. So the afternoon at the office, and at
night walked with my wife in the garden, and my Lord Brouncker with us,
who is newly come to W. Pen’s lodgings; and by and by comes Mr. Hooke;
and my Lord, and he, and I into my Lord’s lodgings, and there discoursed
of many fine things in philosophy, to my great content, and so home to
supper and to bed.
