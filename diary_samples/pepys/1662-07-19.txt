19th. Up early and to some business, and my wife coming to me I staid
long with her discoursing about her going into the country, and as she
is not very forward so am I at a great loss whether to have her go or
no because of the charge, and yet in some considerations I would be glad
she was there, because of the dirtiness of my house and the trouble of
having of a family there. So to my office, and there all the morning,
and then to dinner and my brother Tom dined with me only to see me. In
the afternoon I went upon the river to look after some tarr I am sending
down and some coles, and so home again; it raining hard upon the water,
I put ashore and sheltered myself, while the King came by in his barge,
going down towards the Downs to meet the Queen: the Duke being gone
yesterday. But methought it lessened my esteem of a king, that he should
not be able to command the rain. Home, and Cooper coming (after I had
dispatched several letters) to my mathematiques, and so at night to bed
to a chamber at Sir W. Penâ€™s, my own house being so foul that I cannot
lie there any longer, and there the chamber lies so as that I come into
it over my leads without going about, but yet I am not fully content
with it, for there will be much trouble to have servants running over
the leads to and fro.
