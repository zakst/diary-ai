August 1st. Up, my head aching, and to my office, where Cooper read me
another lecture upon my modell very pleasant. So to my business all the
morning, which increases by people coming now to me to the office. At
noon to the Exchange, where meeting Mr. Creed and Moore we three to a
house hard by (which I was not pleased with) to dinner, and after dinner
and some discourse ordinary by coach home, it raining hard, and so at
the office all the afternoon till evening to my chamber, where, God
forgive me, I was sorry to hear that Sir W. Penâ€™s maid Betty was gone
away yesterday, for I was in hopes to have had a bout with her before
she had gone, she being very pretty. I had also a mind to my own wench,
but I dare not for fear she should prove honest and refuse and then
tell my wife. I staid up late, putting things in order for my going
to Chatham to-morrow, and so to bed, being in pain... with the little
riding in a coach to-day from the Exchange, which do trouble me.
