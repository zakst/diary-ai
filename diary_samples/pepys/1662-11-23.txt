23rd (Lord’s day). Up, after some talk with my wife, soberly, upon
yesterday’s difference, and made good friends, and to church to hear Mr.
Mills, and so home, and Mr. Moore and my brother Tom dined with me.
My wife not being well to-day did not rise. In the afternoon to church
again, and heard drowsy Mr. Graves, and so to see Sir W. Pen, who
continues ill in bed, but grows better and better every day. Thence
to Sir W. Batten’s, and there staid awhile and heard how Sir R. Ford’s
daughter is married to a fellow without friends’ consent, and the match
carried on and made up at Will Griffin’s, our doorkeeper’s. So to my
office and did a little business, and so home and to bed. I talked to
my brother to-day, who desires me to give him leave to look after his
mistress still; and he will not have me put to any trouble or obligation
in it, which I did give him leave to do. I hear to-day how old rich
Audley is lately dead, and left a very great estate, and made a great
many poor familys rich, not all to one. Among others, one Davis, my old
schoolfellow at Paul’s, and since a bookseller in Paul’s Church Yard:
and it seems do forgive one man L60,000 which he had wronged him of, but
names not his name; but it is well known to be the scrivener in Fleet
Street, at whose house he lodged. There is also this week dead a
poulterer, in Gracious Street, which was thought rich, but not so rich,
that hath left L800 per annum, taken in other men’s names, and 40,000
Jacobs in gold.
