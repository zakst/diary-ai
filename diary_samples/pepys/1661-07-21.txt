21st (Lord’s day). At home all the morning, putting my papers in order
against my going to-morrow and doing many things else to that end. Had
a good dinner, and Stankes and his wife with us. To my business again in
the afternoon, and in the evening came the two Trices, Mr. Greene, and
Mr. Philips, and so we began to argue. At last it came to some agreement
that for our giving of my aunt L10 she is to quit the house, and for
other matters they are to be left to the law, which do please us all,
and so we broke up, pretty well satisfyed. Then came Mr. Barnwell and J.
Bowles and supped with us, and after supper away, and so I having taken
leave of them and put things in the best order I could against to-morrow
I went to bed. Old William Luffe having been here this afternoon and
paid up his bond of L20, and I did give him into his hand my uncle’s
surrender of Sturtlow to me before Mr. Philips, R. Barnwell, and Mr.
Pigott, which he did acknowledge to them my uncle did in his lifetime
deliver to him.
