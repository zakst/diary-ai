4 oâ€™clock comes Mrs. Pierce to see my wife, and I into them, and there
find Pierce very fine, and in her own hair, which do become her, and so
says my wife, ten times better than lighter hair, her complexion being
mighty good. With them talked a little, and was invited by her to come
with my wife on Wednesday next in the evening, to be merry there, which
we shall do. Then to the office again, where dispatched a great deal of
business till late at night, to my great content, and then home and with
my wife to our flageolets a little, and so to supper and to bed, after
having my chamber a little wiped up.
