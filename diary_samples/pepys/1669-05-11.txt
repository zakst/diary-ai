11th. My wife again up by four o’clock, to go to gather May-dew; and so
back home by seven, to bed, and by and by I up and to the office, where
all the morning, and dined at noon at home with my people, and so all
the afternoon. In the evening my wife and I all alone, with the boy,
by water, up as high as Putney almost, with the tide, and back again,
neither staying going nor coming; but talking, and singing, and reading
a foolish copy of verses upon my Lord Mayor’s entertaining of all the
bachelors, designed in praise to my Lord Mayor, and so home and to the
office a little, and then home to bed, my eyes being bad. Some trouble
at Court for fear of the Queen’s miscarrying; she being, as they all
conclude, far gone with child.
