September 1st. This morning I took care to get a vessel to carry my
Lord’s things to the Downs on Monday next, and so to White Hall to my
Lord, where he and I did look over the Commission drawn for him by the
Duke’s Council, which I do not find my Lord displeased with, though
short of what Dr. Walker did formerly draw for him. Thence to the Privy
Seal to see how things went there, and I find that Mr. Baron had by
a severe warrant from the King got possession of the office from his
brother Bickerstaffe, which is very strange, and much to our admiration,
it being against all open justice. Mr. Moore and I and several others
being invited to-day by Mr. Goodman, a friend of his, we dined at the
Bullhead upon the best venison pasty that ever I eat of in my life, and
with one dish more, it was the best dinner I ever was at. Here rose
in discourse at table a dispute between Mr. Moore and Dr. Clerke, the
former affirming that it was essential to a tragedy to have the argument
of it true, which the Doctor denied, and left it to me to be judge, and
the cause to be determined next Tuesday morning at the same place, upon
the eating of the remains of the pasty, and the loser to spend 10s. All
this afternoon sending express to the fleet, to order things against my
Lord’s coming and taking direction of my Lord about some rich furniture
to take along with him for the Princess!--[Mary, Princess Royal and
Princess of Orange, who died in December of this year.]--And talking
of this, I hear by Mr. Townsend, that there is the greatest preparation
against the Prince de Ligne’s a coming over from the King of Spain,
that ever was in England for their Embassador. Late home, and what with
business and my boy’s roguery my mind being unquiet, I went to bed.
