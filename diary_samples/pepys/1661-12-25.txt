25th. In the morning to church, where at the door of our pew I was fain
to stay, because that the sexton had not opened the door. A good sermon
of Mr. Mills. Dined at home all alone, and taking occasion from some
fault in the meat to complain of my maidâ€™s sluttery, my wife and I fell
out, and I up to my chamber in a discontent. After dinner my wife comes
up to me and all friends again, and she and I to walk upon the leads,
and there Sir W. Pen called us, and we went to his house and supped with
him, but before supper Captain Cock came to us half drunk, and began to
talk, but Sir W. Pen knowing his humour and that there was no end of his
talking, drinks four great glasses of wine to him, one after another,
healths to the king, and by that means made him drunk, and so he went
away, and so we sat down to supper, and were merry, and so after supper
home and to bed.
