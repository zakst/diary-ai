28th. Up and close at my office all the morning. To the ‘Change busy
at noon, and so home to dinner, and then in the afternoon at the office
till night, and so late home quite tired with business, and without joy
in myself otherwise than that I am by God’s grace enabled to go through
it and one day, hope to have benefit by it. So home to supper and to
bed.
