7th. At the office all the morning, we met, and at noon dined at home,
and after dinner carried my wife and Deb. to Unthankeâ€™s, and I to White
Hall with Mr. Gibson, where the rest of our officers met us, and to the
Commissioners of the Treasury about the Victualling contract, but staid
not long, but thence, sending Gibson to my wife, I with Lord Brouncker
(who was this day in an unusual manner merry, I believe with drink), J.
Minnes, and W. Pen to Bartholomew-Fair; and there saw the dancing mare
again, which, to-day, I find to act much worse than the other day, she
forgetting many things, which her master beat her for, and was
mightily vexed; and then the dancing of the ropes, and also the little
stage-play, which is very ridiculous, and so home to the office with
Lord Brouncker, W. Pen, and myself (J. Minnes being gone home before
not well), and so, after a little talk together, I home to supper and to
bed.
