24th. At the office all morning, at noon Luellin dined with me, and then
abroad to Fleet Street, leaving my wife at Tomâ€™s while I went out
and did a little business. So home again, and went to see Sir Robert
[Slingsby], who continues ill, and this day has not spoke at all, which
makes them all afeard of him. So home.
