4th. Up pretty betimes, that is about 7 o’clock, it being now dark then,
and so got me ready, with my clothes, breeches and warm stockings, and
by water with Henry Russell, cold and wet and windy to Woolwich, to a
hempe ship there, and staid looking upon it and giving direction as to
the getting it ashore, and so back again very cold, and at home without
going on shore anywhere about 12 o’clock, being fearful of taking cold,
and so dined at home and shifted myself, and so all the afternoon at my
office till night, and then home to keep my poor wife company, and so to
supper and to bed.
