31st. To White Hall, where my Lord and the principal officers met, and
had a great discourse about raising of money for the Navy, which is in
very sad condition, and money must be raised for it. Mr. Blackburne, Dr.
Clerke, and I to the Quakerâ€™s and dined there. I back to the Admiralty,
and there was doing things in order to the calculating of the debts of
the Navy and other business, all the afternoon. At night I went to the
Privy Seal, where I found Mr. Crofts and Mathews making up all their
things to leave the office tomorrow, to those that come to wait the
next month. I took them to the Sun Tavern and there made them drink,
and discoursed concerning the office, and what I was to expect tomorrow
about Baron, who pretends to the next month. Late home by coach so far
as Ludgate with Mr. Mathews, and thence home on foot with W. Hewer with
me, and so to bed.
