23rd. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon
home, and with my father dined, and, poor man! he hath put off his
travelling-clothes to-day, and is mighty spruce, and I love to see him
cheerful. After dinner I to my chamber, and my wife and I to talk, and
by and by they tell Mrs. Daniel would speak with me, so I down to the
parlour to her, and sat down together and talked about getting her
husband a place .... I do promise, and mean to do what kindness I can to
her husband. After having been there hasti je was ashamed de peur that
my people pensait.... de it, or lest they might espy us through some
trees, we parted and I to the office, and presently back home again, and
there was asked by my wife, I know not whether simply or with design,
how I come to look as I did, car ego was in much chaleur et de body and
of animi, which I put off with the heat of the season, and so to
other business, but I had some fear hung upon me lest alcuno had sidi
decouvert. So to the office, and then to Sir R. Viner’s about some
part of my accounts now going on with him, and then home and ended my
letters, and then to supper and my chamber to settle many things
there, and then to bed. This noon I was on the ‘Change, where I to my
astonishment hear, and it is in the Gazette, that Sir John Duncomb is
sworn yesterday a Privy-councillor. This day I hear also that last night
the Duke of Kendall, second son of the Duke of York, did die; and that
the other, Duke of Cambridge, continues very ill still. This afternoon
I had opportunity para jouer with Mrs. Pen, tokendo her mammailles
and baisando elle, being sola in the casa of her pater, and she fort
willing.
