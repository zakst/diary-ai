4th. To Whitehall with both Sir Williams, thence by water, where I saw a
man lie dead upon Westminster Stairs that had been drowned yesterday.
To the Temple, and thence to Mr. Phillips and got my copy of Sturtlow
lands. So back to the 3 Tuns at Charing Cross, and there met the two Sir
Williams and Col. Treswell and Mr. Falconer, and dined there at Sir W.
Pen’s cost, and after dinner by water to Cheapside to the painter’s, and
there found my wife, and having sat a little she and I by coach to
the Opera and Theatre, but coming too late to both, and myself being a
little out of tune we returned, and I settled to read in “Mare Clausum
“till bedtime, and so to bed.
