4th. Up, and met at the Office all the morning; and at noon my wife, and
Deb., and Mercer, and W. Hewer and I to the Fair, and there, at the old
house, did eat a pig, and was pretty merry, but saw no sights, my wife
having a mind to see the play “Bartholomew-Fayre,” with puppets. Which
we did, and it is an excellent play; the more I see it, the more I love
the wit of it; only the business of abusing the Puritans begins to grow
stale, and of no use, they being the people that, at last, will be found
the wisest. And here Knepp come to us, and sat with us, and thence took
coach in two coaches, and losing one another, my wife, and Knepp, and I
to Hercules Pillars, and there supped, and I did take from her mouth the
words and notes of her song of “the Larke,” which pleases me mightily.
And so set her at home, and away we home, where our company come home
before us. This night Knepp tells us that there is a Spanish woman
lately come over, that pretends to sing as well as Mrs. Knight; both of
which I must endeavour to hear. So, after supper, to bed.
