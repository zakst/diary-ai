28th. Up after sleeping very well, and so to my office setting down the
Journall of this last three days, and so settled to business again, I
hope with greater cheerfulness and success by this refreshment. At the
office all the morning, and at noon to Wise’s about my viall that is
a-doing, and so home to dinner and then to the office, where we sat all
the afternoon till night, and I late at it till after the office was
risen. Late came my Jane and her brother Will: to entreat for my taking
of the boy again, but I will not hear her, though I would yet be glad to
do anything for her sake to the boy, but receive him again I will not,
nor give him anything. She would have me send him to sea; which if I
could I would do, but there is no ship going out. The poor girl cried
all the time she was with me, and would not go from me, staying about
two hours with me till 10 or 11 o’clock, expecting that she might obtain
something of me, but receive him I will not. So the poor girl was fain
to go away crying and saying little. So from thence home, where my
house of office was emptying, and I find they will do, it with much more
cleanness than I expected. I went up and down among them a good while,
but knowing that Mr. Coventry was to call me in the morning, I went to
bed and left them to look after the people. So to bed.
