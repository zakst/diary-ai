2d. Being with my Lord in the morning about business in his cabin, I
took occasion to give him thanks for his love to me in the share that
he had given me of his Majesty’s money, and the Duke’s. He told the he
hoped to do me a more lasting kindness, if all things stand as they
are now between him and the King, but, says he, “We must have a little
patience and we will rise together; in the mean time I will do you all
the good jobs I can.” Which was great content for me to hear from my
Lord. All the morning with the Captain, computing how much the thirty
ships that come with the King from Scheveling their pay comes to for a
month (because the King promised to give them all a month’s pay), and
it comes to L6,538, and the Charles particularly L777. I wish we had
the money. All the afternoon with two or three captains in the Captain’s
cabin, drinking of white wine and sugar, and eating pickled oysters,
where Captain Sparling told us the best story that ever I heard, about
a gentleman that persuaded a country fool to let him gut his oysters or
else they would stink. At night writing letters to London and Weymouth,
for my Lord being now to sit in the House of Peers he endeavours to get
Mr. Edward Montagu for Weymouth and Mr. George for Dover. Mr. Cooke late
with me in my cabin while I wrote to my wife, and drank a bottle of wine
and so took leave of me on his journey and I to bed.
