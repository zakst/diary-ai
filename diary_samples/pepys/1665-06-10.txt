10th. Lay long in bed, and then up and at the office all the morning.
At noon dined at home, and then to the office busy all the afternoon.
In the evening home to supper; and there, to my great trouble, hear that
the plague is come into the City (though it hath these three or four
weeks since its beginning been wholly out of the City); but where
should it begin but in my good friend and neighbourâ€™s, Dr. Burnett,
in Fanchurch Street: which in both points troubles me mightily. To the
office to finish my letters and then home to bed, being troubled at
the sicknesse, and my head filled also with other business enough, and
particularly how to put my things and estate in order, in case it should
please God to call me away, which God dispose of to his glory!
