28th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay long talking with pleasure with my wife, and so
up and to the Office with Tom, who looks mighty smug upon his marriage,
as Jane also do, both of whom I did give joy, and so Tom and I at work
at the Office all the morning, till dinner, and then dined, W. Batelier
with us; and so after dinner to work again, and sent for Gibson, and
kept him also till eight at night, doing much business. And so, that
being done, and my journal writ, my eyes being very bad, and every day
worse and worse, I fear: but I find it most certain that stronge drinks
do make my eyes sore, as they have done heretofore always; for, when I
was in the country, when my eyes were at the best, their stronge beere
would make my eyes sore: so home to supper, and by and by to bed.
