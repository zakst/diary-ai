13th. After being at the office all the morning, I home and dined, and
taking leave of my wife with my mind not a little troubled how she would
look after herself or house in my absence, especially, too, leaving a
considerable sum of money in the office, I by coach to the Red Lyon in
Aldersgate Street, and there, by agreement, met W. Joyce and Tom Trice,
and mounted, I upon a very fine mare that Sir W. Warren helps me to, and
so very merrily rode till it was very darke, I leading the way through
the darke to Welling, and there, not being very weary, to supper and to
bed. But very bad accommodation at the Swan. In this day’s journey I met
with Mr. White, Cromwell’s chaplin that was, and had a great deale of
discourse with him. Among others, he tells me that Richard is, and hath
long been, in France, and is now going into Italy. He owns publiquely
that he do correspond, and return him all his money. That Richard hath
been in some straits at the beginning; but relieved by his friends. That
he goes by another name, but do not disguise himself, nor deny himself
to any man that challenges him. He tells me, for certain, that offers
had been made to the old man, of marriage between the King and his
daughter, to have obliged him, but he would not.

     [The Protector wished the Duke of Buckingham to marry his daughter
     Frances.  She married, 1. Robert Rich, grandson and heir to Robert,
     Earl of Warwick, on November 11th, 1657, who died in the following
     February;  2. Sir John Russell, Bart.  She died January 27th,
