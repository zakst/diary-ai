26th. Up, and at the office. Sat all the morning, where among other
things I did the first unkind [thing] that ever I did design to Sir
W. Warren, but I did it now to some purpose, to make him sensible
how little any man’s friendship shall avail him if he wants money. I
perceive he do nowadays court much my Lord Bruncker’s favour, who never
did any man much courtesy at the board, nor ever will be able, at
least so much as myself. Besides, my Lord would do him a kindness in
concurrence with me, but he would have the danger of the thing to be
done lie upon me, if there be any danger in it (in drawing up a letter
to Sir W. Warren’s advantage), which I do not like, nor will endure. I
was, I confess, very angry, and will venture the loss of Sir W. Warren’s
kindnesses rather than he shall have any man’s friendship in greater
esteem than mine. At noon home to dinner, and after dinner to the office
again, and there all the afternoon, and at night poor Mrs. Turner
come and walked in the garden for my advice about her husband and her
relating to my Lord Bruncker’s late proceedings with them. I do give her
the best I can, but yet can lay aside some ends of my own in what advice
I do give her. So she being gone I to make an end of my letters, and so
home to supper and to bed, Balty lodging here with my brother, he being
newly returned from mustering in the river.
