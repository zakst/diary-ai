17th. Rose very well and not weary, and with Sir W. Batten to St.
James’s; there did our business. I saw Sir J. Lawson since his return
from sea first this morning, and hear that my Lord Sandwich is come from
Portsmouth to town. Thence I to him, and finding him at my Lord Crew’s,
I went with him home to his house and much kind discourse. Thence my
Lord to Court, and I with Creed to the ‘Change, and thence with Sir W.
Warren to a cook’s shop and dined, discoursing and advising him about
his great contract he is to make tomorrow, and do every day receive
great satisfaction in his company, and a prospect of a just advantage
by his friendship. Thence to my office doing some business, but it being
very cold, I, for fear of getting cold, went early home to bed, my wife
not being come home from my Lady Jemimah, with whom she hath been at a
play and at Court to-day.
