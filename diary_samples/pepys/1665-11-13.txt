13th. Up, and to my office, where busy all the morning, and at noon to
Captain Cocke’s to dinner as we had appointed in order to settle our
business of accounts. But here came in an Alderman, a merchant, a very
merry man, and we dined, and, he being gone, after dinner Cocke and
I walked into the garden, and there after a little discourse he did
undertake under his hand to secure me in L500 profit, for my share of
the profit of what we have bought of the prize goods. We agreed upon
the terms, which were easier on my side than I expected, and so with
extraordinary inward joy we parted till the evening. So I to the office
and among other business prepared a deed for him to sign and seale to
me about our agreement, which at night I got him to come and sign and
seale, and so he and I to Glanville’s, and there he and I sat talking
and playing with Mrs. Penington, whom we found undrest in her smocke
and petticoats by the fireside, and there we drank and laughed, and she
willingly suffered me to put my hand in her bosom very wantonly, and
keep it there long. Which methought was very strange, and I looked
upon myself as a man mightily deceived in a lady, for I could not have
thought she could have suffered it, by her former discourse with me; so
modest she seemed and I know not what. We staid here late, and so home
after he and I had walked till past midnight, a bright moonshine, clear,
cool night, before his door by the water, and so I home after one of the
clock.
