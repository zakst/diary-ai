14th (St. Valentine). This morning comes betimes Dicke Pen, to be my
wife’s Valentine, and come to our bedside. By the same token, I had him
brought to my side, thinking to have made him kiss me; but he perceived
me, and would not; so went to his Valentine: a notable, stout, witty
boy. I up about business, and, opening the door, there was Bagwell’s
wife, with whom I talked afterwards, and she had the confidence to say
she came with a hope to be time enough to be my Valentine, and so indeed
she did, but my oath preserved me from loosing any time with her, and
so I and my boy abroad by coach to Westminster, where did two or three
businesses, and then home to the ‘Change, and did much business there.
My Lord Sandwich is, it seems, with his fleete at Alborough Bay. So home
to dinner and then to the office, where till 12 almost at night, and
then home to supper and to bed.
