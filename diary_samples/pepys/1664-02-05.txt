5th. Up, and down by water, a brave morning, to Woolwich, and there
spent an houre or two to good purpose, and so walked to Greenwich and
thence to Deptford, where I found (with Sir W. Batten upon a survey) Sir
J. Minnes, Sir W. Pen, and my Lady Batten come down and going to dinner.
I dined with them, and so after dinner by water home, all the way going
and coming reading “Faber Fortunae,” which I can never read too often.
At home a while with my wife, and so to my office, where till 8 o’clock,
and then home to look over some Brampton papers, and my uncle’s accounts
as Generall-Receiver of the County for 1647 of our monthly assessment,
which, contrary to my expectation, I found in such good order and so,
thoroughly that I did not expect, nor could have thought, and that being
done, having seen discharges for every farthing of money he received, I
went to bed late with great quiett.
