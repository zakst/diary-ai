28th. Early in the morning rose, and a boy brought me a letter from
Poet Fisher, who tells me that he is upon a panegyrique of the King,
and desired to borrow a piece of me; and I sent him half a piece. To
Westminster, and there dined with Mr. Sheply and W. Howe, afterwards
meeting with Mr. Henson, who had formerly had the brave clock that went
with bullets (which is now taken away from him by the King, it being his
goods).

     [Some clocks are still made with a small ball, or bullet, on an
     inclined plane, which turns every minute.  The King’s clocks
     probably dropped bullets.  Gainsborough the painter had a brother
     who was a dissenting minister at Henley-on-Thames, and possessed a
     strong genius for mechanics.  He invented a clock of a very peculiar
     construction, which, after his death, was deposited in the British
     Museum.  It told the hour by a little bell, and was kept in motion
     by a leaden bullet, which dropped from a spiral reservoir at the top
     of the clock, into a little ivory bucket.  This was so contrived as
     to discharge it at the bottom, and by means of a counter-weight was
     carried up to the top of the clock, where it received another
     bullet, which was discharged as the former.  This seems to have been
     an attempt at the perpetual motion.--Gentleman’s Magazine, 1785,
     p. 931.--B.]

I went with him to the Swan Tavern and sent for Mr. Butler, who was now
all full of his high discourse in praise of Ireland, whither he and his
whole family are going by Coll. Dillon’s persuasion, but so many lies I
never heard in praise of anything as he told of Ireland. So home late at
night and to bed.
