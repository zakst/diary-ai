14th. Up betimes and put up some things to send to Brampton. Then abroad
to the Temple, and up and down about business, and met Mr. Moore; and
with him to an alehouse in Holborn; where in discourse he told me that
he fears the King will be tempted to endeavour the setting the Crown
upon the little Duke, which may cause troubles; which God forbid, unless
it be his due! He told me my Lord do begin to settle to business again,
which I am glad of, for he must not sit out, now he has done his own
business by getting his estate settled, and that the King did send for
him the other day to my Lady Castlemaine’s, to play at cards, where he
lost L50; for which I am sorry, though he says my Lord was pleased at
it, and said he would be glad at any time to lose L50 for the King to
send for him to play, which I do not so well like. Thence home, and
after dinner to the office, where we sat till night, and then made up
my papers and letters by the post, and so home to dance with Pembleton.
This day we received a baskett from my sister Pall, made by her of
paper, which hath a great deal of labour in it for country innocent
work. After supper to bed, and going to bed received a letter from Mr.
Coventry desiring my coming to him to-morrow morning, which troubled me
to think what the business should be, fearing it must be some bad news
in Tom Hater’s business.
