4th. I did many things this morning at home before I went out, as
looking over the joiners, who are flooring my diningroom, and doing
business with Sir Williams

     [“Both Sir Williams” is a favourite expression with Pepys, meaning
     Sir William Batten and Sir William Penn.]

both at the office, and so to Whitehall, and so to the Bullhead, where
we had the remains of our pasty, where I did give my verdict against Mr.
Moore upon last Saturday’s wager, where Dr. Fuller coming in do confirm
me in my verdict. From thence to my Lord’s and despatched Mr. Cooke away
with the things to my Lord. From thence to Axe Yard to my house, where
standing at the door Mrs. Diana comes by, whom I took into my house
upstairs, and there did dally with her a great while, and found that
in Latin “Nulla puella negat.” So home by water, and there sat up late
setting my papers in order, and my money also, and teaching my wife her
music lesson, in which I take great pleasure. So to bed.
