8th. At the office all the morning. After office done, went and eat some
Colchester oysters with Sir W. Batten at his house, and there, with some
company; dined and staid there talking all the afternoon; and late after
dinner took Mrs. Martha out by coach, and carried her to the Theatre
in a frolique, to my great expense, and there shewed her part of the
“Beggar’s Bush,” without much pleasure, but only for a frolique, and so
home again.
