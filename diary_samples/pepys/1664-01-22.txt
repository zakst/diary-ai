22nd. Up, and it being a brave morning, with a gaily to Woolwich, and
there both at the Ropeyarde and the other yarde did much business, and
thence to Greenwich to see Mr. Pett and others value the carved work
of the “Henrietta” (God knows in an ill manner for the King), and so
to Deptford, and there viewed Sir W. Petty’s vessel; which hath an
odd appearance, but not such as people do make of it, for I am of the
opinion that he would never have discoursed so much of it, if it were
not better than other vessels, and so I believe that he was abused the
other day, as he is now, by tongues that I am sure speak before they
know anything good or bad of her. I am sorry to find his ingenuity
discouraged so. So home, reading all the way a good book, and so home to
dinner, and after dinner a lesson on the globes to my wife, and so to my
office till 10 or 11 o’clock at night, and so home to supper and to bed.
