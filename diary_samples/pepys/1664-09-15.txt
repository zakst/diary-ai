15th. At the office all the morning, then to the ‘Change, and so home to
dinner, where Luellin dined with us, and after dinner many people came
in and kept me all the afternoon, among other the Master and Wardens
of Chyrurgeon’s Hall, who staid arguing their cause with me; I did give
them the best answer I could, and after their being two hours with me
parted, and I to my office to do business, which is much on my hands,
and so late home to supper and to bed.
