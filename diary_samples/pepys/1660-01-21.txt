21st. To my Lord, much business. With him to the Council Chamber, where
he was sworn; and the charge of his being admitted Privy Counsellor is
L26. To the Dog Tavern at Westminster, where Murford with Captain Curle
and two friends of theirs went to drink. Captain Curle, late of the
Maria, gave me five pieces in gold and a silver can for my wife for the
Commission I did give him this day for his ship, dated April 20, 1660
last. Thence to the Parliament door and came to Mr. Crew’s to dinner
with my Lord, and with my Lord to see the great Wardrobe, where Mr.
Townsend brought us to the governor of some poor children in tawny
clothes; who had been maintained there these eleven years, which put my
Lord to a stand how to dispose of them, that he may have the house for
his use. The children did sing finely, and my Lord did bid me give them
five pieces in gold at his going away. Thence back to White Hall,
where, the King being gone abroad, my Lord and I walked a great while
discoursing of the simplicity of the Protector, in his losing all that
his father had left him. My Lord told me, that the last words that he
parted with the Protector with (when he went to the Sound), were, that
he should rejoice more to see him in his grave at his return home, than
that he should give way to such things as were then in hatching, and
afterwards did ruin him: and the Protector said, that whatever G.
Montagu, my Lord Broghill, Jones, and the Secretary, would have him to
do, he would do it, be it what it would. Thence to my wife, meeting
Mr. Blagrave, who went home with me, and did give me a lesson upon
the flageolet, and handselled my silver can with my wife and me. To
my father’s, where Sir Thomas Honeywood and his family were come of a
sudden, and so we forced to lie all together in a little chamber, three
stories high.
