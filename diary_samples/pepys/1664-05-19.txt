19th. Up, and it being very rayny weather, which makes it cooler than
it was, by coach to Charing Cross with Sir W. Pen, who is going to
Portsmouth this day, and left him going to St. James’s to take leave
of the Duke, and I to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier; where God
forgive how our Report of my Lord Peterborough’s accounts was read over
and agreed to by the Lords, without one of them understanding it! And
had it been what it would, it had gone: and, besides, not one thing
touching the King’s profit in it minded or hit upon. Thence by coach
home again, and all the morning at the office, sat, and all the
afternoon till 9 at night, being fallen again to business, and I hope
my health will give me leave to follow it. So home to supper and to bed,
finding myself pretty well. A pretty good stool, which I impute to my
whey to-day, and broke wind also.
