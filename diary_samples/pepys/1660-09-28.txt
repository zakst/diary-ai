28th. This morning went to Whitehall to my Lord’s, where Major Hart did
pay me; L23 14s. 9d., due to me upon my pay in my Lord’s troop at the
time of our disbanding, which is a great blessing to have without taking
any law in the world for. But now I must put an end to any hopes of
getting any more, so that I bless God for this. From thence with Mr.
Shepley and Pinkney to the Sun, and did give them a glass of wine and a
peck of oysters for joy of my getting this money. So home, where I
found that Mr. Creed had sent me the L11 5s. that is due to me upon
the remains of account for my sea business, which is also so much clear
money to me, and my bill of impresse

     [For “bill of impress” In Italian ‘imprestare’ means “to lend.”  In
     the ancient accounts of persons officially employed by the crown,
     money advanced, paid on, account, was described as “de prestito,” or
     “in prestitis.”--M. B.]

for L30 is also cleared, so that I am wholly clear as to the sea in all
respects. To the office, and was there till late at night, and among
the officers do hear that they may have our salaries allowed by the
Treasurer, which do make me very glad, and praise God for it. Home to
supper, and Mr. Hater supped with me, whom I did give order to take up
my money of the Treasurer to-morrow if it can be had. So to bed.
