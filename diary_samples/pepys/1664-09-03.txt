3rd. I have had a bad nightâ€™s rest to-night, not sleeping well, as my
wife observed, and once or twice she did wake me, and I thought myself
to be mightily bit with fleas, and in the morning she chid her mayds for
not looking the fleas a-days. But, when I rose, I found that it is only
the change of the weather from hot to cold, which, as I was two winters
ago, do stop my pores, and so my blood tingles and itches all day all
over my body, and so continued to-day all the day long just as I was
then, and if it continues to be so cold I fear I must come to the same
pass, but sweating cured me then, and I hope, and am told, will this
also. At the office sat all the morning, dined at home, and after dinner
to White Hall, to the Fishing Committee, but not above four of us met,
which could do nothing, and a sad thing it is to see so great a work so
ill followed, for at this pace it can come to any thing at first sight.
Mr. Hill came to tell me that he had got a gentlewoman for my wife, one
Mrs. Ferrabosco, that sings most admirably. I seemed glad of it; but
I hear she is too gallant for me, and I am not sorry that I misse her.
Thence to the office, setting some papers right, and so home to supper
and to bed, after prayers.
