27th. Up and to the office, where all the morning busy. At noon, Sir
G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Pen, and myself, were
treated at the Dolphin by Mr. Foly, the ironmonger, where a good plain
dinner, but I expected musique, the missing of which spoiled my dinner,
only very good merry discourse at dinner. Thence with Sir G. Carteret
by coach to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, and thence back to
London, and ‘light in Cheapside and I to Nellson’s, and there met with
a rub at first, but took him out to drink, and there discoursed to my
great content so far with him that I think I shall agree with him for
Bewpers to serve the Navy with. So with great content home and to my
office, where late, and having got a great cold in my head yesterday
home to supper and to bed.
