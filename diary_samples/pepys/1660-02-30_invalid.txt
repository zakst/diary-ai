30th. About eight o’clock in the morning the lieutenant came to me
to know whether I would eat a dish of mackerel, newly catched, for my
breakfast, which the Captain and we did in the coach. All yesterday
and to-day I had a great deal of pain... and in my back, which made me
afeard. But it proved nothing but cold, which I took yesterday night.
All this morning making up my accounts, in which I counted that I had
made myself now worth about L80, at which my heart was glad, and blessed
God. Many Dover men come and dine with my Lord. My Lord at ninepins in
the afternoon. In the afternoon Mr. Sheply told me how my Lord had put
me down for 70 guilders among the money which was given to my Lord’s
servants, which my heart did much rejoice at. My Lord supped alone in
his chamber. Sir R. Stayner supped with us, and among other things told
us how some of his men did grumble that no more of the Duke’s money
come to their share and so would not receive any; whereupon he called up
those that had taken it, and gives them three shares apiece more, which
was very good, and made good sport among the seamen. To bed.
