10th. Up betimes, and many people to me about business. To the office
and there sat till noon, and then home and dined, and to the office
again all the afternoon, where we sat all, the first time of our
resolution to sit both forenoons and afternoons. Much business at night
and then home, and though late did see some work done by the plasterer
to my new window in the boyâ€™s chamber plastered. Then to supper, and
after having my head combed by the little girle to bed. Bad news that
the plague is decreased in the general again and two increased in the
sickness.
