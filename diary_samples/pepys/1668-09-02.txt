2nd. Fast-day for the burning of London, strictly observed. I at home
at the office all day, forenoon and afternoon, about the Victualler’s
contract and other things, and at night home to supper, having had but
a cold dinner, Mr. Gibson with me; and this evening comes Mr. Hill to
discourse with me about Yeabsly and Lanyon’s business, wherein they are
troubled, and I fear they have played the knave too far for me to help
or think fit to appear for them. So he gone, and after supper, to bed,
being troubled with a summons, though a kind one, from Mr. Jessop, to
attend the Commissioners of Accounts tomorrow.
