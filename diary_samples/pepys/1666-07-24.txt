24th. Up, and to the office, where little business done, our heads being
full of expectation of the fleete’s being engaged, but no certain notice
of it, only Sheppeard in the Duke’s yacht left them yesterday morning
within a league of the Dutch fleete, and making after them, they
standing into the sea. At noon to dinner, and after dinner with Mercer
(as of late my practice is) a song and so to the office, there to set up
again my frames about my Platts, which I have got to be all gilded,
and look very fine, and then to my business, and busy very late, till
midnight, drawing up a representation of the state of my victualling
business to the Duke, I having never appeared to him doing anything
yet and therefore I now do it in writing, I now having the advantage
of having had two fleetes dispatched in better condition than ever any
fleetes were yet, I believe; at least, with least complaint, and by this
means I shall with the better confidence get my bills out for my salary.
So home to bed.
