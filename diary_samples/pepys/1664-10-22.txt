22nd. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon comes
my uncle Thomas and his daughter Mary about getting me to pay them the
L30 due now, but payable in law to her husband. I did give them the
best answer I could, and so parted, they not desiring to stay to dinner.
After dinner I down to Deptford, and there did business, and so back to
my office, where very late busy, and so home to supper and to bed.
