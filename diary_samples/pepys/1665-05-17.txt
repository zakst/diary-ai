17th. Up, and by appointment to a meeting of Sir John Lawson and Mr.
Cholmly’s atturney and Mr. Povy at the Swan taverne at Westminster to
settle their business about my being secured in the payment of money
to Sir J. Lawson in the other’s absence. Thence at Langford’s, where I
never was since my brother died there. I find my wife and Mercer, having
with him agreed upon two rich silk suits for me, which is fit for me to
have, but yet the money is too much, I doubt, to lay out altogether; but
it is done, and so let it be, it being the expense of the world that
I can the best bear with and the worst spare. Thence home, and after
dinner to the office, where late, and so home to supper and to bed. Sir
J. Minnes and I had an angry bout this afternoon with Commissioner Pett
about his neglecting his duty and absenting himself, unknown to us, from
his place at Chatham, but a most false man I every day find him more
and more, and in this very full of equivocation. The fleete we doubt
not come to Harwich by this time. Sir W. Batten is gone down this day
thither, and the Duchesse of Yorke went down yesterday to meet the Duke.
