13th. Up betimes, this being the first morning of my promise upon a
forfeite not to lie in bed a quarter of an hour after my first waking.
Abroad to St. James’s, and there much business, the King also being with
us a great while. Thence to the ‘Change, and thence with Captain Tayler
and Sir W. Warren dined at a house hard by for discourse sake, and so I
home, and there meeting a letter from Mrs. Martin desiring to speak
with me, I (though against my promise of visiting her) did go, and there
found her in her childbed dress desiring my favour to get her husband a
place. I staid not long, but taking Sir W. Warren up at White Hall home,
and among other discourse fell to a business which he says shall if
accomplished bring me L100. He gone, I to supper and to bed. This day
my wife begun to wear light-coloured locks, quite white almost, which,
though it makes her look very pretty, yet not being natural, vexes me,
that I will not have her wear them. This day I saw my Lord Castlemayne
at St. James’s, lately come from France.
