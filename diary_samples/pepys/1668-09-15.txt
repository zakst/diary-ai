15th. Up mighty betimes, my wife and people, Mercer lying here all
night, by three o’clock, and I about five; and they before, and I after
them, to the coach in Bishopsgate Street, which was not ready to set
out. So took wife and Mercer and Deb. and W. Hewer (who are all to set
out this day for Cambridge, to cozen Roger Pepys’s, to see Sturbridge
Fayre); and I shewed them the Exchange, which is very finely carried on,
with good dispatch. So walked back and saw them gone, there being only
one man in the coach besides them; and so home to the Office, where Mrs.
Daniel come and staid talking to little purpose with me to borrow money,
but I did not lend her any, having not opportunity para hater allo thing
mit her. At the office all the morning, and at noon dined with my people
at home, and so to the office again a while, and so by water to the
King’s playhouse, to see a new play, acted but yesterday, a translation
out of French by Dryden, called “The Ladys a la Mode:” so mean a thing
as, when they come to say it would be acted again to-morrow, both he
that said it, Beeson, and the pit fell a-laughing, there being this day
not a quarter of the pit full. Thence to St. James’s and White Hall to
wait on the Duke of York, but could not come to speak to him till time
to go home, and so by water home, and there late at the office and my
chamber busy, and so after a little supper to bed.
