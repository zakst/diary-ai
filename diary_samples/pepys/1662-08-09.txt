9 at night, and so home and to bed. But though I drank no wine to-day,
yet how easily was I of my own accord stirred up to desire my aunt and
this pretty lady (for it was for her that I did it) to carry them to
Greenwich and see the pleasure boats. But my aunt would not go, of which
since I am much glad.
