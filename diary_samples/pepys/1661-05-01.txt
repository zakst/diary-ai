May 1st. Up early, and bated at Petersfield, in the room which the King
lay in lately at his being there. Here very merry, and played us and our
wives at bowls. Then we set forth again, and so to Portsmouth, seeming
to me to be a very pleasant and strong place; and we lay at the Red
Lyon, where Haselrigge and Scott and Walton did hold their councill,
when they were here, against Lambert and the Committee of Safety.
Several officers of the Yard came to see us to-night, and merry we were,
but troubled to have no better lodgings.
