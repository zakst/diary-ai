26th. This morning Sir W. Pen and I to the Treasury office, and there
we paid off the Amity (Captain Stokes’s ship that was at Guinny) and
another ship, and so home, and after dinner Sir William came to me, and
he and his son and Aaugliter, and I and my wife, by coach to Moorfields
to walk; but it was most foul weather, and so we went into an alehouse
and there eat some cakes and ale, and a washeallbowle

               About the streets are singing.”

     The old custom of carrying the wassail bowl from door to door, with
     songs and merriment, in Christmas week, is still observed in some of
     our rural districts.--B.]

woman and girl came to us and sung to us. And after all was done I
called my boy (Wayneman) to us to eat some cake that was left, and the
woman of the house told us that he had called for two cakes and a pot
of ale for himself, at which I was angry, and am resolved to correct him
for it. So home, and Sir W. Pen and his son and daughter to supper to me
to a good turkey, and were merry at cards, and so to bed.
