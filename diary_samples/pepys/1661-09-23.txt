23rd. Up, and sad to hear my father and mother wrangle as they used
to do in London, of which I took notice to both, and told them that I
should give over care for anything unless they would spend what they
have with more love and quiet. So (John Bowles coming to see us before
we go) we took horse and got early to Baldwick; where there was a fair,
and we put in and eat a mouthfull of pork, which they made us pay 14d.
for, which vexed us much. And so away to Stevenage, and staid till a
showre was over, and so rode easily to Welling, where we supped well,
and had two beds in the room and so lay single, and still remember it
that of all the nights that ever I slept in my life I never did pass a
night with more epicurism of sleep; there being now and then a noise of
people stirring that waked me, and then it was a very rainy night, and
then I was a little weary, that what between waking and then sleeping
again, one after another, I never had so much content in all my life,
and so my wife says it was with her.
