25th. All the morning at the office. At noon with Mr. Moore to the
Coffee-house, where among other things the great talk was of the effects
of this late great wind; and I heard one say that he had five great
trees standing together blown down; and, beginning to lop them, one of
them, as soon as the lops were cut off, did, by the weight of the root,
rise again and fasten. We have letters from the forest of Deane, that
above 1000 Oakes and as many beeches are blown down in one walk there.
And letters from my father tell me of L20 hurt done to us at Brampton.
This day in the news-book I find that my Lord Buckhurst and his fellows
have printed their case as they did give it in upon examination to a
justice of Peace, wherein they make themselves a very good tale that
they were in pursuit of thieves, and that they took this man for one of
them, and so killed him; and that he himself confessed it was the first
time of his robbing; and that he did pay dearly for it, for he was a
dead man. But I doubt things will be proved otherwise, as they say. Home
to dinner, and by and by comes Mr. Hunt and his wife to see us and staid
a good, while with us. Then parted, and I to my study in the office. The
first time since the alteracon that I have begun to do business myself
there, and I think I shall be well pleased with it. At night home to
supper and to bed.
