15th. After playing a little upon my new little flageolet, that is so
soft that pleases me mightily, betimes to my office, where most of the
morning. Then by coach, 1s., and meeting Lord Brouncker, ‘light at
the Exchange, and thence by water to White Hall, 1s., and there to the
Chapel, expecting wind musick and to the Harp-and-Ball, and drank all
alone, 2d. Back, and to the fiddling concert, and heard a practice
mighty good of Grebus, and thence to Westminster Hall, where all cry out
that the House will be severe with Pen; but do hope well concerning
the buyers, that we shall have no difficulty, which God grant! Here met
Creed, and, about noon, he and I, and Sir P. Neale to the Quaker’s, and
there dined with a silly Executor of Bishop Juxon’s, and cozen Roger
Pepys. Business of money goes on slowly in the House. Thence to White
Hall by water, and there with the Duke of York a little, but stayed not,
but saw him and his lady at his little pretty chapel, where I never was
before: but silly devotion, God knows! Thence I left Creed, and to the
King’s playhouse, into a corner of the 18d. box, and there saw “The
Maid’s Tragedy,” a good play. Coach, 1s.: play and oranges, 2s. 6d.
Creed come, dropping presently here, but he did not see me, and come to
the same place, nor would I be seen by him. Thence to my Lord Crew’s,
and there he come also after, and there with Sir T. Crew bemoaning my
Lord’s folly in leaving his old interest, by which he hath now lost
all. An ill discourse in the morning of my Lord’s being killed, but this
evening Godolphin tells us here that my Lord is well. Thence with Creed
to the Cock ale-house, and there spent 6d., and so by coach home, 2s.
