14th. Awake, and to chide my wife again, and I find that my wife has
got too great head to be brought down soon, nor is it possible with any
convenience to keep Ashwell longer, my wife is so set and convinced, as
she was in Sarah, to make her appear a Lyer in every small thing that
we shall have no peace while she stays. So I up and to my office doing
several businesses in my study, and so home to dinner. The time having
outslipt me and my stomach, it being past, two a-clock, and yet before
we could sit down to dinner Mrs. Harper and her cousin Jane came, and
we treated and discoursed long about her coming to my wife for a chamber
mayd, and I think she will do well. So they went away expecting notice
when she shall come, and so we sat down to dinner at four a-clock
almost, and then I walked forth to my brotherâ€™s, where I found my father
very discontented, and has no mind to come to my house, and would have
begun some of the differences between my wife and him, but I desired to
hear none of them, and am sorry at my folly in forcing it and theirs in
not telling me of it at the beginning, and therefore am resolved to make
the best of a bad market, and to bring my wife to herself again as soon
and as well as I can. So we parted very kindly, and he will dine with me
to-morrow or next day. Thence walked home, doing several errands by the
way, and at home took my wife to visit Sir W. Pen, who is still lame,
and after an hour with him went home and supped, and with great content
to bed.
