3rd. Up and by water with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes to White Hall
to the Duke of Albemarle, where, after a little business, we parted, and
I to the Harp and Ball, and there staid a while talking to Mary, and so
home to dinner. After dinner to the Duke of Albemarle’s again, and so to
the Swan, and there ‘demeurais un peu’de temps con la fille’, and so to
the Harp and Ball, and alone ‘demeurais un peu de temps baisant la’,
and so away home and late at the office about letters, and so home,
resolving from this night forwards to close all my letters, if possible,
and end all my business at the office by daylight, and I shall go near
to do it and put all my affairs in the world in good order, the season
growing so sickly, that it is much to be feared how a man can escape
having a share with others in it, for which the good Lord God bless
me, or to be fitted to receive it. So after supper to bed, and mightily
troubled in my sleep all night with dreams of Jacke Cole, my old
schoolfellow, lately dead, who was born at the same time with me, and we
reckoned our fortunes pretty equal. God fit me for his condition!
