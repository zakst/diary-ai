8th. Up and by coach to my Lord Peterboroughâ€™s, where anon my Lord Ashly
and Sir Thomas Ingram met, and Povy about his accounts, who is one of
the most unhappy accountants that ever I knew in all my life, and one
that if I were clear in reference to my bill of L117 he should be hanged
before I would ever have to do with him, and as he understands nothing
of his business himself, so he hath not one about him that do. Here late
till I was weary, having business elsewhere, and thence home by coach,
and after dinner did several businesses and very late at my office, and
so home to supper and to bed.
