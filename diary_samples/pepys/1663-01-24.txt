24th. Lay pretty long, and by lying with my sheet upon my lip, as I have
of old observed it, my upper lip was blistered in the morning. To the
office all the morning, sat till noon, then to the Exchange to look out
for a ship for Tangier, and delivered my manuscript to be bound at the
stationer’s. So to dinner at home, and then down to Redriffe, to see a
ship hired for Tangier, what readiness she was in, and found her ready
to sail. Then home, and so by coach to Mr. Povy’s, where Sir W.
Compton, Mr. Bland, Gawden, Sir J. Lawson and myself met to settle the
victualling of Tangier for the time past, which with much ado we did,
and for a six months’ supply more. So home in Mr. Gawden’s coach, and
to my office till late about business, and find that it is business that
must and do every day bring me to something.--[In earlier days Pepys
noted for us each few pounds or shillings of graft which he annexed at
each transaction in his office.]--So home to supper and to bed.
