14th. Up early and advised with my wife for the putting of all our
things in a readiness to be sent to our new house. To my Lord’s, where
he was in bed very late. So with Major Tollhurst and others to Harper’s,
and I sent for my barrel of pickled oysters and there ate them; while we
were doing so, comes in Mr. Pagan Fisher; the poet, and promises me what
he had long ago done, a book in praise of the King of France, with my
armes, and a dedication to me very handsome. After him comes Mr. Sheply
come from sea yesterday, whom I was glad to see that he may ease me of
the trouble of my Lord’s business. So to my Lord’s, where I staid doing
his business and taking his commands. After that to Westminster Hall,
where I paid all my debts in order to my going away from hence. Here I
met with Mr. Eglin, who would needs take me to the Leg in King
Street and gave me a dish of meat to dinner; and so I sent for Mons.
L’Impertinent, where we sat long and were merry. After that parted, and
I took Mr. Butler [Mons. L’Impertinent] with me into London by coach
and shewed him my house at the Navy Office, and did give order for the
laying in coals. So into Fenchurch Street, and did give him a glass of
wine at Rawlinson’s, and was trimmed in the street. So to my Lord’s late
writing letters, and so home, where I found my wife had packed up all
her goods in the house fit for a removal. So to bed.
