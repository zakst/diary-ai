13th. Up, and by water to White Hall, and so to Sir H. Cholmly’s, who
not being up I made a short visit to Sir W. Coventry, and he and I
through the Park to White Hall, and thence I back into the Park, and
there met Sir H. Cholmly, and he and I to Sir Stephen Fox’s, where we
met and considered the business of the Excise, how far it is charged
in reference to the payment of the Guards and Tangier. Thence he and I
walked to Westminster Hall and there took a turn, it being holyday, and
so back again, and I to the mercer’s, and my tailor’s about a stuff suit
that I am going to make. Thence, at noon, to Hercules Pillars, and there
dined all alone, and so to White Hall, some of us attended the Duke
of York as usual, and so to attend the Council about the business of
Hemskirke’s project of building a ship that sails two feet for one of
any other ship, which the Council did agree to be put in practice, the
King to give him, if it proves good, L5000 in hand, and L15,000 more in
seven years, which, for my part, I think a piece of folly for them to
meddle with, because the secret cannot be long kept. So thence, after
Council, having drunk some of the King’s wine and water with Mr.
Chevins, my Lord Brouncker, and some others, I by water to the Old Swan,
and there to Michell’s, and did see her and drink there, but he being
there je ne baiser la; and so back again by water to Spring Garden all
alone, and walked a little, and so back again home, and there a little
to my viall, and so to bed, Mrs. Turner having sat and supped with me.
This morning I hear that last night Sir Thomas Teddiman, poor man! did
die by a thrush in his mouth: a good man, and stout and able, and much
lamented; though people do make a little mirth, and say, as I believe
it did in good part, that the business of the Parliament did break his
heart, or, at least, put him into this fever and disorder, that caused
his death.
