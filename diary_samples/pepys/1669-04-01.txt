April 1st. Up, and with Colonel Middleton, at the desire of Rear-Admiral
Kempthorne, the President, for our assisting them, to the Court-martiall
on board a yacht in the River here, to try the business of the Purser’s
complaints, Baker against Trevanion, his Commander, of “The Dartmouth.”
 But, Lord! to see what wretched doings there were among all the
Commanders to ruin the Purser, and defend the Captain in all his
rogueries, be it to the prejudice of the King or Purser, no good man
could bear! I confess I was pretty high, which did not at least the
young gentlemen Commander like; and Middleton did the like. But could
not bring it to any issue this day, sitting till two o’clock; and
therefore we being sent for, went to Sir W. Pen’s by invitation to dine;
where my wife was, and my Lord Brouncker and his mistress, and Sir J.
Minnes and his niece; and here a bad dinner, and little mirth, I being
little pleased with my host. However, I made myself sociable; and so,
after dinner, my wife and I, with my Lord Brouncker and his mistress,
they set us down at my cozen Turner’s, and there we staid awhile and
talked; and particularly here we met with Dr. Ball, the Parson of the
Temple, who did tell me a great many pretty stories about the manner
of the Parsons being paid for their preaching at Paul’s heretofore,
and now, and the ground of the Lecture, and heretofore the names of
the founders thereof, which were many, at some 5s., some 6s. per annum
towards it: and had their names read in the pulpit every sermon among
those holy persons that the Church do order a collect for, giving God
thanks for. By and by comes by my desire Commissioner Middleton’s coach
and horses for us, and we went with it towards the Park, thinking to
have met The. Turner and Betty, but did not; so turned back again to
their lodging, and there found them and Mr. Batelier, and there, after
a little talk, we took leave, and carry Batelier home with us. So to
supper, and so to bed.
