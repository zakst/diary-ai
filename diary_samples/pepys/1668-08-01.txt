August 1st. All the morning at the office. After dinner my wife, and
Deb., and I, to the Kingâ€™s house again, coming too late yesterday to
hear the prologue, and do like the play better now than before; and,
indeed, there is a great deal of true wit in it, more than in the common
sort of plays, and so home to my business, and at night to bed, my eyes
making me sad.
