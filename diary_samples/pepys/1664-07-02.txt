2nd. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the
‘Change, and there, which is strange, I could meet with nobody that
I could invite home to my venison pasty, but only Mr. Alsopp and Mr.
Lanyon, whom I invited last night, and a friend they brought along with
them. So home and with our venison pasty we had other good meat and good
discourse. After dinner sat close to discourse about our business of
the victualling of the garrison of Tangier, taking their prices of all
provisions, and I do hope to order it so that they and I also may get
something by it, which do much please me, for I hope I may get nobly and
honestly with profit to the King. They being gone came Sir W. Warren,
and he and I discoursed long about the business of masts, and then in
the evening to my office, where late writing letters, and then home to
look over some Brampton papers, which I am under an oathe to dispatch
before I spend one half houre in any pleasure or go to bed before 12
o’clock, to which, by the grace of God, I will be true. Then to bed.
When I came home I found that to-morrow being Sunday I should gain
nothing by doing it to-night, and to-morrow I can do it very well
and better than to-night. I went to bed before my time, but with a
resolution of doing the thing to better purpose to-morrow.
