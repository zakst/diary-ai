12th. From a very hard frost, when I wake, I find a very great thaw,
and my house overflown with it, which vexed me. At the office and home,
doing business all the morning. Then dined with my wife and sat talking
with her all the afternoon, and then to the office, and there examining
my copy of Mr. Hollandâ€™s book till 10 at night, and so home to supper
and bed.
