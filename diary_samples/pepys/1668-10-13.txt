Lord Brouncker, and there did get his ready assent to T. Hater’s having
of Mr. Turner’s place, and so Sir J. Minnes’s also: but when we come to
sit down at the Board, comes to us Mr. Wren this day to town, and
tells me that James Southern do petition the Duke of York for the
Storekeeper’s place of Deptford, which did trouble me much, and also the
Board, though, upon discourse, after he was gone, we did resolve to move
hard for our Clerks, and that places of preferment may go according to
seniority and merit. So, the Board up, I home with my people to dinner,
and so to the office again, and there, after doing some business, I with
Mr. Turner to the Duke of Albemarle’s at night; and there did speak to
him about his appearing to Mr. Wren a friend to Mr. Turner, which he did
take kindly from me; and so away thence, well pleased with what we had
now done, and so I with him home, stopping at my Lord Brouncker’s, and
getting his hand to a letter I wrote to the Duke of York for T. Hater,
and also at my Lord Middleton’s, to give him an account of what I had
done this day, with his man, at Alderman Backewell’s, about the getting
of his L1000 paid;

     loss of which caused Pepys so much anxiety.  See November 26th,
