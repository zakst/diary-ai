3rd. Up and to the office, where strange to see how Sir W. Pen is
flocked to by people of all sorts against his going to sea. At the
office did much business, among other an end of that that has troubled
me long, the business of the bewpers and flags. At noon to the ‘Change,
and thence by appointment was met with Bagwell’s wife, and she followed
me into Moorfields, and there into a drinking house, and all alone eat
and drank together. I did there caress her, but though I did make some
offer did not receive any compliance from her in what was bad, but very
modestly she denied me, which I was glad to see and shall value her the
better for it, and I hope never tempt her to any evil more. Thence back
to the town, and we parted and I home, and then at the office late,
where Sir W. Pen came to take his leave of me, being to-morrow, which is
very sudden to us, to go on board to lie on board, but I think will come
ashore again before the ship, the Charles,

     [“The Royal Charles” was the Duke of York’s ship, and Sir William
     Penn, who hoisted his flag in the “Royal James” on November 8th,
     shifted to the “Royal Charles” on November 30th.  The duke gave Penn
     the command of the fleet immediately under himself.  On Penn’s
     monument he is styled “Great Captain Commander under His Royal
     Highness” (Penn’s “Memorials of Sir William Penn,” vol. ii.,
     p. 296).]

can go away. So home to supper and to bed. This night Sir W. Batten did,
among other things, tell me strange newes, which troubles me, that my
Lord Sandwich will be sent Governor to Tangier, which, in some respects,
indeed, I should be glad of, for the good of the place and the safety
of his person; but I think his honour will suffer, and, it may be, his
interest fail by his distance.
