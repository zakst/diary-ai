16th. Up before four o’clock, and after some business took Will forth,
and he and I walked over the Tower Hill, but the gate not being open
we walked through St. Catharine’s and Ratcliffe (I think it is) by the
waterside above a mile before we could get a boat, and so over the water
in a scull (which I have not done a great while), and walked finally
to Deptford, where I saw in what forwardness the work is for Sir W.
Batten’s house and mine, and it is almost ready. I also, with Mr. Davis,
did view my cozen Joyce’s tallow, and compared it with the Irish tallow
we bought lately, and found ours much more white, but as soft as it; now
what is the fault, or whether it be or no a fault, I know not. So walked
home again as far as over against the Towre, and so over and home,
where I found Sir W. Pen and Sir John Minnes discoursing about Sir John
Minnes’s house and his coming to live with us, and I think he intends to
have Mr. Turner’s house and he to come to his lodgings, which I shall be
very glad of. We three did go to Mr. Turner’s to view his house, which
I think was to the end that Sir John Minnes might see it. Then by water
with my wife to the Wardrobe, and dined there; and in the afternoon with
all the children by water to Greenwich, where I showed them the King’s
yacht, the house, and the park, all very pleasant; and so to the tavern,
and had the musique of the house, and so merrily home again. Will and
I walked home from the Wardrobe, having left my wife at the Tower Wharf
coming by, whom I found gone to bed not very well.... So to bed.
