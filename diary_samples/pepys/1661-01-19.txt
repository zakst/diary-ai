19th. To the Comptroller’s, and with him by coach to White Hall; in our
way meeting Venner and Pritchard upon a sledge, who with two more Fifth
Monarchy men were hanged to-day, and the two first drawn and quartered.
Where we walked up and down, and at last found Sir G. Carteret, whom
I had not seen a great while, and did discourse with him about our
assisting the Commissioners in paying off the Fleet, which we think to
decline. Here the Treasurer did tell me that he did suspect Thos.
Hater to be an informer of them in this work, which we do take to be a
diminution of us, which do trouble me, and I do intend to find out
the truth. Hence to my Lady, who told me how Mr. Hetley is dead of the
small-pox going to Portsmouth with my Lord. My Lady went forth to dinner
to her father’s, and so I went to the Leg in King Street and had a
rabbit for myself and my Will, and after dinner I sent him home and
myself went to the Theatre, where I saw “The Lost Lady,” which do not
please me much. Here I was troubled to be seen by four of our office
clerks, which sat in the half-crown box and I in the 1s. 6d. From thence
by link, and bought two mouse traps of Thomas Pepys, the Turner, and so
went and drank a cup of ale with him, and so home and wrote by post to
Portsmouth to my Lord and so to bed.
