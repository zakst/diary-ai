17th. Up, lying long, being wearied yesterday with long walking. So
to the office, where all the morning with fresh occasion of vexing at
myself for my late neglect of business, by which I cannot appear half so
usefull as I used to do. Home at noon to dinner, and then to my office
again, where I could not hold my eyes open for an houre, but I drowsed
(so little sensible I apprehend my soul is of the necessity of minding
business), but I anon wakened and minded my business, and did a great
deale with very great pleasure, and so home at night to supper and to
bed, mightily pleased with myself for the business that I have done, and
convinced that if I would but keepe constantly to do the same I might
have leisure enough and yet do all my business, and by the grace of God
so I will. So to bed.
