11th. At the office this morning, Sir G. Carteret with us; and we agreed
upon a letter to the Duke of York, to tell him the sad condition of this
office for want of money; how men are not able to serve us more without
some money; and that now the credit of the office is brought so low,
that none will sell us any thing without our personal security given
for the same. All the afternoon abroad about several businesses, and at
night home and to bed.
