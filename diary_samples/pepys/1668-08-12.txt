12th. Up, and all the morning busy at my office. Thence to the Excise
Office, and so to the Temple to take counsel about Major Nicholls’s
business for the King. So to several places about business, and among
others to Drumbleby’s about the mouths for my paper tubes, and so to
the ‘Change and home. Met Captain Cocke, who tells me that he hears for
certain the Duke of York will lose the authority of an Admiral, and be
governed by a Committee: and all our Office changed; only they are in
dispute whether I shall continue or no, which puts new thoughts in
me, but I know not whether to be glad or sorry. Home to dinner, where
Pelting dines with us, and brings some partridges, which is very good
meat; and, after dinner, I, and wife, and Mercer, and Deb., to the Duke
of York’s house, and saw “Mackbeth,” to our great content, and then
home, where the women went to the making of my tubes, and I to the
office, and then come Mrs. Turner and her husband to advise about their
son, the Chaplain, who is turned out of his ship, a sorrow to them,
which I am troubled for, and do give them the best advice I can, and so
they gone we to bed.
