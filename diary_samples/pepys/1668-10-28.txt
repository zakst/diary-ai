28th. So by coach with Mr. Gibson to Chancery Lane, and there made oath
before a Master of Chancery to the Tangier account of fees, and so to
White Hall, where, by and by, a Committee met, my Lord Sandwich there,
but his report was not received, it being late; but only a little
business done, about the supplying the place with victuals. But I
did get, to my great content, my account allowed of fees, with great
applause by my Lord Ashly and Sir W. Pen. Thence home, calling at one or
two places; and there about our workmen, who are at work upon my wifeâ€™s
closet, and other parts of my house, that we are all in dirt. So after
dinner with Mr. Gibson all the afternoon in my closet, and at night to
supper and to bed, my wife and I at good peace, but yet with some little
grudgings of trouble in her and more in me about the poor girle.
