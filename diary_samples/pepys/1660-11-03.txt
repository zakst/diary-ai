3d. Saturday. At home all the morning. In the afternoon to White
Hall, where my Lord and Lady were gone to kiss the Queeneâ€™s hand. To
Westminster Hall, where I met with Tom Doling, and we two took Mrs. Lane
to the alehouse, where I made her angry with commending of Tom Newton
and her new sweetheart to be both too good for her, so that we parted
with much anger, which made Tom and me good sport. So home to write
letters by the post, and so to bed.
