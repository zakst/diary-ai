10th. Early to my Lord’s, who privately told me how the King had made
him Embassador in the bringing over the Queen.

     [Katherine of Braganza, daughter of John IV. of Portugal, born 1638,
     married to Charles II., May 21st, 1662.  After the death of the king
     she lived for some time at Somerset House, and then returned to
     Portugal, of which country she became Regent in 1704 on the
     retirement of her brother Don Pedro.  She died December 31st, 1705.]

That he is to go to Algier, &c., to settle the business, and to put the
fleet in order there; and so to come back to Lisbone with three ships,
and there to meet the fleet that is to follow him. He sent for me, to
tell me that he do intrust me with the seeing of all things done in his
absence as to this great preparation, as I shall receive orders from my
Lord Chancellor and Mr. Edward Montagu. At all which my heart is above
measure glad; for my Lord’s honour, and some profit to myself, I hope.
By and by, out with Mr. Shepley Walden, Parliament-man for Huntingdon,
Rolt, Mackworth, and Alderman Backwell, to a house hard by, to drink
Lambeth ale. So I back to the Wardrobe, and there found my Lord going to
Trinity House, this being the solemn day of choosing Master, and my Lord
is chosen, so he dines there to-day. I staid and dined with my Lady;
but after we were set, comes in some persons of condition, and so the
children and I rose and dined by ourselves, all the children and I,
and were very merry and they mighty fond of me. Then to the office, and
there sat awhile. So home and at night to bed, where we lay in Sir R.
Slingsby’s lodgings in the dining room there in one green bed, my house
being now in its last work of painting and whiting.
