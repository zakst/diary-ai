15th. Up and to the office, where we met and sat all the morning. At
noon home to dinner, and after dinner by coach to Sir Philip Warwicke’s,
he having sent for me, but was not within, so I to my Lord Crew’s, who
is very lately come to towne, and with him talking half an houre of
the business of the warr, wherein he is very doubtful, from our want of
money, that we shall fail. And I do concur with him therein. After some
little discourse of ordinary matters, I away to Sir Philip Warwicke’s
again, and was come in, and gone out to my Lord Treasurer’s; whither
I followed him, and there my business was, to be told that my Lord
Treasurer hath got L10,000 for us in the Navy, to answer our great
necessities, which I did thank him for; but the sum is not considerable.
So home, and there busy all the afternoon till night, and then home to
supper and to bed.
