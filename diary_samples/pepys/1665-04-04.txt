4th. All the morning at the office busy, at noon to the ‘Change, and
then went up to the ‘Change to buy a pair of cotton stockings, which I
did at the husband’s shop of the most pretty woman there, who did also
invite me to buy some linnen of her, and I was glad of the occasion,
and bespoke some bands of her, intending to make her my seamstress, she
being one of the prettiest and most modest looked women that ever I did
see. Dined at home and to the office, where very late till I was ready
to fall down asleep, and did several times nod in the middle of my
letters.
