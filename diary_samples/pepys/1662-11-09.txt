9th (Lord’s day). Lay alone a good while, my mind busy about pleading
to-morrow to the Duke if there shall be occasion for this chamber that I
lie in against Sir J., Minnes. Then up, and after being ready walked to
my brother’s, where my wife is, calling at many churches, and then to
the Temple, hearing a bit there too, and observing that in the streets
and churches the Sunday is kept in appearance as well as I have known
it at any time. Then to dinner to my brother’s, only he and my wife, and
after dinner to see Mr. Moore, who is pretty well, and he and I to St.
Gregory’s, where I escaped a great fall down the staires of the gallery:
so into a pew there and heard Dr. Ball make a very good sermon, though
short of what I expected, as for the most part it do fall out. So home
with Mr. Moore to his chamber, and after a little talk I walked home to
my house and staid at Sir W. Batten’s. Till late at night with him and
Sir J. Minnes, with whom we did abundance of most excellent discourse of
former passages of sea commanders and officers of the navy, and so home
and to bed, with my mind well at ease but only as to my chamber, which I
fear to lose.
