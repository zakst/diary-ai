3rd. Up, and to the office, where busy till g o’clock, and then to White
Hall, to the Council-chamber, where I did present the Duke of York with
an account of the charge of the present fleete, to his satisfaction; and
this being done, did ask his leave for my going out of town five or
six days, which he did give me, saying, that my diligence in the King’s
business was such, that I ought not to be denied when my own business
called me any whither. Thence with Sir D. Gawden to Westminster, where
I did take a turn or two, and met Roger Pepys, who is mighty earnest
for me to stay from going into the country till he goes, and to bring my
people thither for some time: but I cannot, but will find another time
this summer for it. Thence with him home, and there to the office till
noon, and then with Lord Brouncker, Sir J. Minnes, and Sir G. Carteret,
upon whose accounts they have been this day to the Three Tuns to dinner,
and thence back again home, and after doing a little business I by coach
to the King’s house, and there saw good, part of “The Scornfull Lady,”
 and that done, would have takn out Knepp, but she was engaged, and so
to my Lord Crew’s to visit him; from whom I learn nothing but that
there hath been some controversy at the Council-table, about my Lord
Sandwich’s signing, where some would not have had him, in the treaty
with Portugall; but all, I think, is over in it. Thence by coach
to Westminster to the Hall, and thence to the Park, where much good
company, and many fine ladies; and in so handsome a hackney I was, that
I believe Sir W. Coventry and others, who looked on me, did take me to
be in one of my own, which I was a little troubled for. So to the lodge,
and drank a cup of new milk, and so home, and there to Mrs. Turner’s,
and sat and talked with her, and then home to bed, having laid my
business with W. Hewer to go out of town Friday next, with hopes of a
great deal of pleasure.
