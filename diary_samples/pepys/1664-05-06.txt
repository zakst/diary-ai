6th. This morning up and to my office, where Sympson my joyner came
to work upon altering my closet, which I alter by setting the door in
another place, and several other things to my great content. Busy at it
all day, only in the afternoon home, and there, my books at the office
being out of order, wrote letters and other businesses. So at night with
my head full of the business of my closet home to bed, and strange it is
to think how building do fill my mind and put out all other things out
of my thoughts.
