5th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed talking with my wife, and among other
things fell out about my maid Sarah, whom my wife would fain put away,
when I think her as good a servant as ever came into a house, but it
seems my wife would have one that would dress a head well, but we were
friends at last. I to church; and this day the parson has got one to
read with a surplice on. I suppose himself will take it up hereafter,
for a cunning fellow he is as any of his coat. Dined with my wife, and
then to talk again above, chiefly about her learning to dance against
her going next year into the country, which I am willing she shall do.
Then to church to a tedious sermon, and thence walked to Tom’s to see
how things are in his absence in the country, and so home and in my
wife’s chamber till bedtime talking, and then to my office to put things
in order to wait on the Duke to-morrow morning, and so home and to bed.
