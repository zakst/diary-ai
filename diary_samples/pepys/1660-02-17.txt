1780.--M. B.]

where we found my father and brother very well. After dressing myself,
about ten o’clock, my father, brother, and I to Mr. Widdririgton, at
Christ’s College, who received us very civilly, and caused my brother to
be admitted, while my father, he, and I, sat talking. After that
done, we take leave. My father and brother went to visit some friends,
Pepys’s, scholars in Cambridge, while I went to Magdalene College, to
Mr. Hill, with whom I found Mr. Zanchy, Burton, and Hollins, and was
exceeding civilly received by them. I took leave on promise to sup with
them, and to my Inn again, where I dined with some others that were
there at an ordinary. After dinner my brother to the College, and my
father and I to my Cozen Angier’s, to see them, where Mr. Fairbrother
came to us. Here we sat a while talking. My father he went to look
after his things at the carrier’s, and my brother’s chamber, while Mr.
Fairbrother, my Cozen Angier, and Mr. Zanchy, whom I met at Mr. Merton’s
shop (where I bought ‘Elenchus Motuum’, having given my former to Mr.
Downing when he was here), to the Three Tuns, where we drank pretty hard
and many healths to the King, &c., till it began to be darkish: then we
broke up and I and Mr. Zanchy went to Magdalene College, where a very
handsome supper at Mr. Hill’s chambers, I suppose upon a club among
them, where in their discourse I could find that there was nothing
at all left of the old preciseness in their discourse, specially on
Saturday nights. And Mr. Zanchy told me that there was no such thing
now-a-days among them at any time. After supper and some discourse
then to my Inn, where I found my father in his chamber, and after some
discourse, and he well satisfied with this day’s work, we went to bed,
my brother lying with me, his things not being come by the carrier that
he could not lie in the College.
