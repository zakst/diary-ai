20th. Up and to my office, where all the morning, and dined at home,
Mr. Deane, of Woolwich, with me, and he and I all the afternoon down by
water, and in a timber yard, measuring of timber, which I now understand
thoroughly, and shall be able in a little time to do the King great
service. Home in the evening, and after Willâ€™s reading a little in the
Latin Testament, to bed.
