19th (Lord’s day). Up, and to my chamber, and there I up and down in the
house spent the morning getting things ready against noon, when come Mr.
Cooper, Hales, Harris, Mr. Butler, that wrote Hudibras, and Mr. Cooper’s
cozen Jacke; and by and by comes Mr. Reeves and his wife, whom I never
saw before: and there we dined: a good dinner, and company that pleased
me mightily, being all eminent men in their way. Spent all the afternoon
in talk and mirth, and in the evening parted, and then my wife and I to
walk in the garden, and so home to supper, Mrs. Turner and husband and
daughter with us, and then to bed.
