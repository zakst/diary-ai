3rd. Lay long in bed, and so up and abroad to several places about petty
businesses. Among others to Tom’s, who I find great hopes of that he
will do well, which I am glad of, and am not now so hasty to get a wife
for him as I was before. So to dinner to my Lord Crew’s with him and his
Lady, and after dinner to Faithorne’s, and there bought some pictures
of him; and while I was there, comes by the King’s life-guard, he being
gone to Lincoln’s Inn this afternoon to see the Revells there; there
being, according to an old custom, a prince and all his nobles, and
other matters of sport and charge. So home, and up to my chamber to look
over my papers and other things, my mind being much troubled for these
four or five days because of my present great expense, and will be so
till I cast up and see how my estate stands, and that I am loth to do
for fear I have spent too much, and delay it the rather that I may pay
for my pictures and my wife’s, and the book that I am buying for Paul’s
School before I do cast up my accompts.
