24th. This morning I had Mr. Luellin and Mr. Sheply to the remainder
of my oysters that were left yesterday. After that very busy all
the morning. While I was at dinner with my Lord, the Coxon of the
Vice-Admiral came for me to the Vice-Admiral to dinner. So I told my
Lord and he gave me leave to go. I rose therefore from table and went,
where there was very many commanders, and very pleasant we were on board
the London, which hath a state-room much bigger than the Nazeby, but not
so rich. After that, with the Captain on board our own ship, where we
were saluted with the news of Lambert’s being taken, which news was
brought to London on Sunday last. He was taken in Northamptonshire by
Colonel Ingoldsby, at the head of a party, by which means their whole
design is broke, and things now very open and safe. And every man begins
to be merry and full of hopes. In the afternoon my Lord gave a great
large character to write out, so I spent all the day about it, and after
supper my Lord and we had some more very good musique and singing of
“Turne Amaryllis,” as it is printed in the song book, with which my Lord
was very much pleased. After that to bed.
