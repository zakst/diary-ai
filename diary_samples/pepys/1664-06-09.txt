9th. Up and at my office all the morning. At noon dined at home, Mr.
Hunt and his kinswoman (wife in the country), after dinner I to the
office, where we sat all the afternoon. Then at night by coach to attend
the Duke of Albemarle about the Tangier ship. Coming back my wife spied
me going home by coach from Mr. Hunt’s, with whom she hath gained much
in discourse to-day concerning W. Howe’s discourse of me to him. That he
was the man that got me to be secretary to my Lord; and all that I have
thereby, and that for all this I never did give him 6d. in my life.
Which makes me wonder that this rogue dare talk after this manner, and I
think all the world is grown false. But I hope I shall make good use
of it. So home to supper and to bed, my eyes aching mightily since last
night.
