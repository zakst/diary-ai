25th. Up betimes to the office, and there, as well as all the afternoon,
saving a little dinner time, all alone till late at night writing
letters and doing business, that I may get beforehand with my business
again, which hath run behind a great while, and then home to supper
and to bed. This day I am told that Dr. Burnett, my physician, is this
morning dead of the plague; which is strange, his man dying so long ago,
and his house this month open again. Now himself dead. Poor unfortunate
man!
