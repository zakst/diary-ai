18th (Lord’s day). Up, and after the barber had done, and I had spoke
with Mr. Smith (whom I sent for on purpose to speak of Field’s business,
who stands upon L250 before he will release us, which do trouble me
highly), and also Major Allen of the Victualling Office about his ship
to be hired for Tangier, I went to church, and thence home to dinner
alone with my wife, very pleasant, and after dinner to church again, and
heard a dull, drowsy sermon, and so home and to my office, perfecting my
vows again for the next year, which I have now done, and sworn to in
the presence of Almighty God to observe upon the respective penalties
thereto annexed, and then to Sir W. Pen’s (though much against my will,
for I cannot bear him, but only to keep him from complaint to others
that I do not see him) to see how he do, and find him pretty well, and
ready to go abroad again.
