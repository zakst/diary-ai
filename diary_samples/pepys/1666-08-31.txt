31st. To bed at 2 or 3 in the morning and up again at 6 to go by
appointment to my Lord Bellasses, but he out of town, which vexed me.
So back and got Mr. Poynter to enter into, my book while I read from my
last nightâ€™s notes the letter, and that being done to writing it fair.
At noon home to dinner, and then the boy and I to the office, and there
he read while I writ it fair, which done I sent it to Sir W. Coventry
to peruse and send to the fleete by the first opportunity; and so pretty
betimes to bed. Much pleased to-day with thoughts of gilding the backs
of all my books alike in my new presses.
