8th. By coach with both Sir Williams to Westminster; this being a great
day there in the House to pass the business for chimney-money, which was
done. In the Hall I met with Serjeant Pierce; and he and I to drink
a cup of ale at the Swan, and there he told me how my Lady Monk hath
disposed of all the places which Mr. Edwd. Montagu hoped to have had,
as he was Master of the Horse to the Queen; which I am afraid will undo
him, because he depended much upon the profit of what he should make by
these places. He told me, also, many more scurvy stories of him and his
brother Ralph, which troubles me to hear of persons of honour as they
are. About one oâ€™clock with both Sir Williams and another, one Sir Rich.
Branes, to the Trinity House, but came after they had dined, so we had
something got ready for us. Here Sir W. Batten was taken with a fit of
coughing that lasted a great while and made him very ill, and so he went
home sick upon it. Sir W. Pen. and I to the office, whither afterward
came Sir G. Carteret; and we sent for Sir Thos. Allen, one of the
Aldermen of the City, about the business of one Colonel Appesley, whom
we had taken counterfeiting of bills with all our hands and the officers
of the yards, so well counterfeited that I should never have mistrusted
them. We staid about this business at the office till ten at night,
and at last did send him with a constable to the Counter; and did give
warrants for the seizing of a complice of his, one Blinkinsopp. So home
and wrote to my father, and so to bed.
