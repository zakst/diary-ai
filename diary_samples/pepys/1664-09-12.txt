12th. Up, and to my cozen Anthony Joyce’s, and there took leave of my
aunt James, and both cozens, their wives, who are this day going down to
my father’s by coach. I did give my Aunt 20s., to carry as a token to my
mother, and 10s. to Pall. Thence by coach to St. James’s, and there did
our business as usual with the Duke; and saw him with great pleasure
play with his little girle,--[Afterwards Queen Mary II.]--like an
ordinary private father of a child. Thence walked to Jervas’s, where
I took Jane in the shop alone, and there heard of her, her master and
mistress were going out. So I went away and came again half an hour
after. In the meantime went to the Abbey, and there went in to see the
tombs with great pleasure. Back again to Jane, and there upstairs and
drank with her, and staid two hours with her kissing her, but nothing
more. Anon took boat and by water to the Neat Houses over against Fox
Hall to have seen Greatorex dive, which Jervas and his wife were gone to
see, and there I found them (and did it the rather for a pretence for
my having been so long at their house), but being disappointed of some
necessaries to do it I staid not, but back to Jane, but she would not
go out with me. So I to Mr. Creed’s lodgings, and with him walked up
and down in the New Exchange, talking mightily of the convenience and
necessity of a man’s wearing good clothes, and so after eating a messe
of creame I took leave of him, he walking with me as far as Fleete
Conduit, he offering me upon my request to put out some money for me
into Backewell’s hands at 6 per cent. interest, which he seldom gives,
which I will consider of, being doubtful of trusting any of these great
dealers because of their mortality, but then the convenience of having
one’s money, at an houre’s call is very great. Thence to my uncle
Wight’s, and there supped with my wife, having given them a brave barrel
of oysters of Povy’s giving me. So home and to bed.
