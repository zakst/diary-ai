4th. In the morning to the Privy Seal to do some things of the last
month, my Lord Privy Seal having been some time out of town. Then my
wife came to me to Whitehall, and we went and walked a good while in St.
James’s Park to see the brave alterations, and so to Wilkinson’s, the
Cook’s, to dinner, where we sent for Mrs. Sarah and there dined and had
oysters, the first I have eat this year, and were pretty good. After
dinner by agreement to visit Mrs. Symonds, but she is abroad, which I
wonder at, and so missing her my wife again to my mother’s (calling at
Mrs. Pierce’s, who we found brought to bed of a girl last night) and
there staid and drank, and she resolves to be going to-morrow without
fail. Many friends come in to take their leave of her, but a great
deal of stir I had again tonight about getting her to go to see my Lady
Sandwich before she goes, which she says she will do tomorrow. So I
home.
