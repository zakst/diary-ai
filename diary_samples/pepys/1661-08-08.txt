8th. Early in the mornink to Whitehall, but my Lord Privy Seal came
not all the morning. At noon Mr. Moore and I to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where my Lady and all merry and well. Back again to the Privy Seal; but
my Lord comes not all the afternoon, which made me mad and gives all
the world reason to talk of his delaying of business, as well as of his
severity and ill using of the Clerks of the Privy Seal. In the evening I
took Mons. Eschar and Mr. Moore and Dr. Pierceâ€™s brother (the souldier)
to the tavern next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them. Here
I met with Mr. Mage, and discoursing of musique Mons. Eschar spoke so
much against the English and in praise of the French that made him mad,
and so he went away. After a stay with them a little longer we parted
and I home.
