2nd. Up, and very busy all the morning, upon my accounts of Tangier, to
present to the Commissioners of the Treasury in the afternoon, and the
like upon the accounts of the office. This morning come to me Mr. Gawden
about business, with his gold chain about his neck, as being Sheriffe
of the City this year. At noon to the Treasury Office again, and there
dined and did business, and then by coach to the New Exchange, and there
met my wife and girl, and took them to the King’s house to see “The
Traytour,” which still I like as a very good play; and thence, round by
the wall, home, having drunk at the Cock ale-house, as I of late have
used to do, and so home and to my chamber to read, and so to supper and
to bed.
