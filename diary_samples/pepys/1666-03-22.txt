22nd. At the office all the morning, and there come news from Hogg that
our shipp hath brought in a Lubecker to Portsmouth, likely to prove
prize, of deals, which joys us. At noon home to dinner, and then Sir W.
Pen, Sir R. Ford, and I met at Sir W. Batten’s to examine our papers,
and have great hopes to prove her prize, and Sir R. Ford I find a
mighty yare--[Quick or ready, a naval term frequently used by
Shakespeare.]--man in this business, making exceeding good observations
from the papers on our behalf. Hereupon concluded what to write to Hogg
and Middleton, which I did, and also with Mr. Oviatt (Sir R. Ford’s son,
who is to be our solicitor), to fee some counsel in the Admiralty, but
none in town. So home again, and after writing letters by the post,
I with all my clerks and Carcasse and Whitfield to the ticket-office,
there to be informed in the method and disorder of the office, which I
find infinite great, of infinite concernment to be mended, and did
spend till 12 at night to my great satisfaction, it being a point of our
office I was wholly unacquainted in. So with great content home and to
bed.
