29th (Sunday). This day I put on first my fine cloth suit made of a
cloak that had like to have been [dirted] a year ago, the very day that
I put it on. After sermon in the morning Mr. Cook came from London with
a packet, bringing news how all the young lords that were not in arms
against the Parliament do now sit. That a letter is come from the King
to the House, which is locked up by the Council ‘till next Tuesday
that it may be read in the open House when they meet again, they having
adjourned till then to keep a fast tomorrow. And so the contents is not
yet known. L13,000 of the L20,000 given to General Monk is paid out of
the Exchequer, he giving L12 among the teller clerks of Exchequer. My
Lord called me into the great cabin below, where I opened my letters and
he told me that the Presbyterians are quite mastered by the Cavaliers,
and that he fears Mr. Crew did go a little too far the other day in
keeping out the young lords from sitting. That he do expect that the
King should be brought over suddenly, without staying to make any terms
at all, saying that the Presbyterians did intend to have brought him
in with such conditions as if he had been in chains. But he shook his
shoulders when he told me how Monk had betrayed him, for it was he that
did put them upon standing to put out the lords and other members that
came not within the qualifications, which he [Montagu] did not like, but
however he [Monk] had done his business, though it be with some kind
of baseness. After dinner I walked a great while upon the deck with the
chyrurgeon and purser, and other officers of the ship, and they all pray
for the King’s coming, which I pray God send.
