July 1st. Up; and all the morning we met at the office about the
Victualler’s contract. At noon home to dinner, my Cozen Roger, come
newly to town, dined with us, and mighty importunate for our coming down
to Impington, which I think to do, this Sturbridge fair. Thence I set
him down at the Temple, and Commissioner Middleton dining the first time
with me, he and I to White Hall, and so to St. James’s, where we met;
and much business with the Duke of York. And I find the Duke of York
very hot for regulations in the Navy; and, I believe, is put on it by
W. Coventry; and I am glad of it; and particularly, he falls heavy
on Chatham-yard,, and is vexed that Lord Anglesey did, the other day,
complain at the Council-table of disorders in the Navy, and not to him.
So I to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier; and there vexed, with the
importunity and clamours of Alderman Backewell, for my acquittance
for money supplied by him to the garrison, before I have any order for
paying it: so home, calling at several places-among others, the ‘Change,
and on Cooper, to know when my wife shall come to sit for her picture,
which will be next week, and so home and to walk with my wife, and then
to supper and to bed.
