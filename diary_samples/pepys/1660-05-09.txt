9th. Up very early, writing a letter to the King, as from the two
Generals of the fleet, in answer to his letter to them, wherein my Lord
do give most humble thanks for his gracious letter and declaration; and
promises all duty and obedience to him. This letter was carried this
morning to Sir Peter Killigrew,

     [Sir Peter Killigrew, Knight, of Arwenack, Cornwall, was known as
     “Peter the Post,” from the alacrity with which he despatched “like
     wild fire” all the messages and other commissions entrusted to him
     in the King’s cause.  His son Peter, who succeeded his uncle as
     second baronet in 1665, was M.P. for Camelford in 1660.]

who came hither this morning early to bring an order from the Lords’
House to my Lord, giving him power to write an answer to the King. This
morning my Lord St. John and other persons of honour were here to see
my Lord, and so away to Flushing. After they were gone my Lord and I
to write letters to London, which we sent by Mr. Cook, who was very
desirous to go because of seeing my wife before she went out of town.
As we were sitting down to dinner, in comes Noble with a letter from the
House of Lords to my Lord, to desire him to provide ships to transport
the Commissioners to the King, which are expected here this week. He
brought us certain news that the King was proclaimed yesterday with
great pomp, and brought down one of the Proclamations, with great joy to
us all; for which God be praised. After dinner to ninepins and lost 5s.
This morning came Mr. Saunderson,

     [Afterwards Sir William Sanderson, gentleman of the chamber, author
     of the “History of Mary Queen of Scots, James I., and Charles I.”
      His wife, Dame Bridget, was mother of the maids.]

that writ the story of the King, hither, who is going over to the King.
He calls me cozen and seems a very knowing man. After supper to bed
betimes, leaving my Lord talking in the Coach with the Captain.
