29th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and at my chamber all the day, both morning
and afternoon (only a little at dinner with my wife alone), upon the
settling of my Tangier accounts towards the evening of all reckonings
now against the new year, and here I do see the great folly of letting
things go long unevened, it being very hard for me and dangerous to
state after things are gone out of memory, and much more would be so
should I have died in this time and my accounts come to other hands, to
understand which would never be. At night comes Mrs. Turner to see us;
and there, among other talk, she tells me that Mr. William Pen, who
is lately come over from Ireland, is a Quaker again, or some very
melancholy thing; that he cares for no company, nor comes into any which
is a pleasant thing, after his being abroad so long, and his father such
a hypocritical rogue, and at this time an Atheist. She gone, I to my
very great content do find my accounts to come very even and naturally,
and so to supper and to bed.
