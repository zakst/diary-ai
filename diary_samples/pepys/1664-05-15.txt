15th (Lord’s day). Rose, and as I had intended without reference to this
pain, took physique, and it wrought well with me, my wife lying from me
to-night, the first time she did in the same house ever since we were
married, I think (unless while my father was in town, that he lay with
me). She took physique also to-day, and both of our physiques wrought
well, so we passed our time to-day, our physique having done working,
with some pleasure talking, but I was not well, for I could make no
water yet, but a drop or two with great pain, nor break any wind. In
the evening came Mr. Vernatty to see me and discourse about my Lord
Peterborough’s business, and also my uncle Wight and Norbury, but I took
no notice nor showed any different countenance to my uncle Wight, or
he to me, for all that he carried himself so basely to my wife the last
week, but will take time to make my use of it. So, being exceeding hot,
to bed, and slept well.
