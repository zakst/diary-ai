7th. Lay long to-day, pleasantly discoursing with my wife about the
dinner we are to have for the Joyces, a day or two hence. Then up and
with Mr. Margetts to Limehouse to see his ground and ropeyarde there,
which is very fine, and I believe we shall employ it for the Navy, for
the King’s grounds are not sufficient to supply our defence if a warr
comes. Thence back to the ‘Change, where great talke of the forwardnesse
of the Dutch, which puts us all to a stand, and particularly myself for
my Lord Sandwich, to think him to lie where he is for a sacrifice, if
they should begin with us. So home and Creed with me, and to dinner, and
after dinner I out to my office, taking in Bagwell’s wife, who I knew
waited for me, but company came to me so soon that I could have no
discourse with her, as I intended, of pleasure. So anon abroad with
Creed walked to Bartholomew Fayre, this being the last day, and there
saw the best dancing on the ropes that I think I ever saw in my life,
and so all say, and so by coach home, where I find my wife hath had her
head dressed by her woman, Mercer, which is to come to her to-morrow,
but my wife being to go to a christening tomorrow, she came to do her
head up to-night. So a while to my office, and then to supper and to
bed.
