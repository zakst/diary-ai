12th. Up, being frighted that Mr. Coventry was come to towne and now at
the office, so I run down without eating or drinking or washing to the
office and it proved my Lord Berkeley. There all the morning, at noon to
the â€˜Change, and so home to dinner, Mr. Wayth with me, and then to the
office, where mighty busy till very late, but I bless God I go through
with it very well and hope I shall.
