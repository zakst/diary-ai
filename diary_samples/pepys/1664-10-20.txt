20th. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon my uncle
Thomas came, dined with me, and received some money of me. Then I to
my office, where I took in with me Bagwellâ€™s wife, and there I caressed
her, and find her every day more and more coming with good words and
promises of getting her husband a place, which I will do. So we parted,
and I to my Lord Sandwich at his lodgings, and after a little stay
away with Mr. Cholmely to Fleete Streete; in the way he telling me that
Tangier is like to be in a bad condition with this same Fitzgerald,
he being a man of no honour, nor presence, nor little honesty, and
endeavours: to raise the Irish and suppress the English interest there;
and offend every body, and do nothing that I hear of well, which I am
sorry for. Thence home, by the way taking two silver tumblers home,
which I have bought, and so home, and there late busy at my office, and
then home to supper and to bed.
