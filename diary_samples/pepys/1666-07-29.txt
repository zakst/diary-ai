29th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and all the morning in my chamber making up my
accounts in my book with my father and brother and stating them. Towards
noon before sermon was done at church comes newes by a letter to Sir W.
Batten, to my hand, of the late fight, which I sent to his house, he at
church. But, Lord! with what impatience I staid till sermon was done,
to know the issue of the fight, with a thousand hopes and fears and
thoughts about the consequences of either. At last sermon is done and he
come home, and the bells immediately rung soon as the church was done.
But coming; to Sir W. Batten to know the newes, his letter said nothing
of it; but all the towne is full of a victory. By and by a letter from
Sir W. Coventry tells me that we have the victory. Beat them into the
Weelings;
