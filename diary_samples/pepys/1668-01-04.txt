4th. Up, and there to the office, where we sat all the morning; at noon
home to dinner, where my clerks and Mr. Clerke the sollicitor with me,
and dinner being done I to the office again, where all the afternoon
till late busy, and then home with my mind pleased at the pleasure of
despatching my business, and so to supper and to bed, my thoughts full,
how to order our design of having some dancing at our house on Monday
next, being Twelfth-day. It seems worth remembering that this day I did
hear my Lord Anglesey at the table, speaking touching this new Act
for Accounts, say that the House of Lords did pass it because it was a
senseless, impracticable, ineffectual, and foolish Act; and that my Lord
Ashly having shown this that it was so to the House of Lords, the Duke
of Buckingham did stand up and told the Lords that they were beholden
to my Lord Ashly, that having first commended them for a most grave and
honourable assembly, he thought it fit for the House to pass this Act
for Accounts because it was a foolish and simple Act: and it seems it
was passed with but a few in the House, when it was intended to have met
in a grand Committee upon it. And it seems that in itself it is not to
be practiced till after this session of Parliament, by the very words of
the Act, which nobody regarded, and therefore cannot come in force yet,
unless the next meeting they do make a new Act for the bringing it
into force sooner; which is a strange omission. But I perceive my Lord
Anglesey do make a mere laughing-stock of this Act, as a thing that can
do nothing considerable, for all its great noise.
