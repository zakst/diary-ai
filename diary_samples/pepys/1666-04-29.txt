29th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where Mr. Mills, a lazy, simple
sermon upon the Devil’s having no right to any thing in this world. So
home to dinner, and after dinner I and my boy down by water to Redriffe
and thence walked to Mr. Evelyn’s, where I walked in his garden till he
come from Church, with great pleasure reading Ridly’s discourse, all my
way going and coming, upon the Civill and Ecclesiastical Law. He being
come home, he and I walked together in the garden with mighty pleasure,
he being a very ingenious man; and the more I know him, the more I love
him. His chief business with me was to propose having my cozen Thomas
Pepys in Commission of the Peace, which I do not know what to say to
till I speake with him, but should be glad of it and will put him upon
it. Thence walked back again reading and so took water and home, where
I find my uncle and aunt Wight, and supped with them upon my leads with
mighty pleasure and mirthe, and they being gone I mighty weary to bed,
after having my haire of my head cut shorter, even close to my skull,
for coolnesse, it being mighty hot weather.
