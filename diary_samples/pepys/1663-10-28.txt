28th. Up and at my office all the morning, and at noon Mr. Creed came to
me and dined with me, and after dinner Murford came to me and he and I
discoursed wholly upon his breach of contract with us. After that Mr.
Creed and I abroad, I doing several errands, and with him at last to the
great coffee-house, and there after some common discourse we parted and
I home, paying what I owed at the Mitre in my way, and at home Sympson
the joyner coming he set up my press for my cloaks and other small
things, and so to my office a little, and to supper, and to bed. This
morning Mr. Blackburne came to me, and telling me what complaints Will
made of the usage he had from my wife and other discouragements, and,
I seeing him, instead of advising, rather favouring his kinsman, I told
him freely my mind, but friendlily, and so we have concluded to have him
have a lodging elsewhere, and that I will spare him L15 of his salary,
and if I do not need to keep another L20.
