5th. Up betimes, and by water to Westminster, there to speak the
first time with Sir Robert Long, to give him my Privy Seal and my Lord
Treasurer’s order for Tangier Tallys; he received me kindly enough.
Thence home by water, and presently down to Woolwich and back to
Blackewall, and there, viewed the Breach, in order to a Mast Docke, and
so to Deptford to the Globe, where my Lord Brunkard, Sir J. Minnes,
Sir W. Batten, and Commissioner Pett were at dinner, having been at the
Breach also, but they find it will be too great charge to make use of
it. After dinner to Mr. Evelyn’s; he being abroad, we walked in his
garden, and a lovely noble ground he hath indeed. And among other
rarities, a hive of bees, so as being hived in glass, you may see the
bees making their honey and combs mighty pleasantly. Thence home, and I
by and by to Mr. Povy’s to see him, who is yet in his chamber not well,
and thence by his advice to one Lovett’s, a varnisher, to see his
manner of new varnish, but found not him at home, but his wife, a very
beautiful woman, who shewed me much variety of admirable work, and is in
order to my having of some papers fitted with his lines for my use for
tables and the like. I know not whether I was more pleased with the
thing, or that I was shewed it by her, but resolved I am to have some
made. So home to my office late, and then to supper and to bed. My wife
tells me that she hears that my poor aunt James hath had her breast cut
off here in town, her breast having long been out of order. This day,
after I had suffered my owne hayre to grow long, in order to wearing it,
I find the convenience of periwiggs is so great, that I have cut off all
short again, and will keep to periwiggs.
