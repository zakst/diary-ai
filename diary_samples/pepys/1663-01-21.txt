21st. Up early leaving my wife very ill in bed... and to my office till
eight o’clock, there coming Ch. Pepys

     [Charles Pepys was second son of Thomas Pepys, elder brother of
     Samuel’s father.  Samuel paid part of the legacy to Charles and his
     elder brother Thomas on May 25th, 1664.]

to demand his legacy of me, which I denied him upon good reason of
his father and brother’s suing us, and so he went away. Then came
Commissioner Pett, and he and I by agreement went to Deptford, and after
a turn or two in the yard, to Greenwich, and thence walked to Woolwich.
Here we did business, and I on board the Tangier-merchant, a ship
freighted by us, that has long lain on hand in her despatch to Tangier,
but is now ready for sailing. Back, and dined at Mr. Ackworth’s, where
a pretty dinner, and she a pretty, modest woman; but above all things
we saw her Rocke, which is one of the finest things done by a woman that
ever I saw. I must have my wife to see it. After dinner on board the
Elias, and found the timber brought by her from the forest of Deane to
be exceeding good. The Captain gave each of us two barrels of pickled
oysters put up for the Queen mother. So to the Dock again, and took in
Mrs. Ackworth and another gentlewoman, and carried them to London, and
at the Globe tavern, in Eastcheap, did give them a glass of wine, and so
parted. I home, where I found my wife ill in bed all day, and her face
swelled with pain. My Will has received my last two quarters salary, of
which I am glad. So to my office till late and then home, and after the
barber had done, to bed.
