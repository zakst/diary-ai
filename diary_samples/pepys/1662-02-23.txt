23rd (Lord’s day). My cold being increased, I staid at home all day,
pleasing myself with my dining-room, now graced with pictures, and
reading of Dr. Fuller’s “Worthys.” So I spent the day, and at night
comes Sir W. Pen and supped and talked with me. This day by God’s mercy
I am 29 years of age, and in very good health, and like to live and get
an estate; and if I have a heart to be contented, I think I may reckon
myself as happy a man as any is in the world, for which God be praised.
So to prayers and to bed.
