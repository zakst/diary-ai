17th. Up, and with the two Sir Williams by coach to the Duke of York,
who is come to St. James’s, the first time we have attended him there
this year. In our way, in Tower Street, we saw Desbrough walking on
foot: who is now no more a prisoner, and looks well, and just as he used
to do heretofore. When we come to the Duke of York’s I was spoke to
by Mr. Bruncker on behalf of Carcasse. Thence by coach to Sir G.
Carteret’s, in London, there to pass some accounts of his, and at it
till dinner, and then to work again a little, and then go away, and my
wife being sent for by me to the New Exchange I took her up, and there
to the King’s playhouse (at the door met with W. Joyce in the street,
who come to our coach side, but we in haste took no notice of him, for
which I was sorry afterwards, though I love not the fellow, yet for his
wife’s sake), and saw a piece of “Rollo,” a play I like not much, but
much good acting in it: the house very empty. So away home, and I a
little to the office, and then to Sir Robert Viner’s, and so back,
and find my wife gone down by water to take a little ayre, and I to
my chamber and there spent the night in reading my new book, “Origines
Juridiciales,” which pleases me. So to supper and to bed.
