17th. Up betimes and to the office, where all the morning busy, and
then at noon home to dinner, and so again to the office awhile, and then
abroad to the Excize-Office, where I met Mr. Ball, and did receive the
paper I went for; and there fell in talk with him, who, being an old
cavalier, do swear and curse at the present state of things, that we
should be brought to this, that we must be undone and cannot be saved;
that the Parliament is sitting now, and will till midnight, to find how
to raise this L300,000, and he doubts they will not do it so as to be
seasonable for the King: but do cry out against our great men at Court;
how it is a fine thing for a Secretary of State to dance a jigg, and
that it was not so heretofore; and, above all, do curse my Lord of
Bristoll, saying the worst news that ever he heard in his life, or that
the Devil could ever bring us, was this Lord’s coming to prayers the
other day in the House of Lords, by which he is coming about again from
being a Papist, which will undo this nation; and he says he ever did
say, at the King’s first coming in, that this nation could not be safe
while that man was alive. Having done there, I away towards Westminster,
but seeing by the coaches the House to be up, I stopped at the ‘Change
(where, I met Mrs. Turner, and did give her a pair of gloves), and there
bought several things for my wife, and so to my bookseller’s, and there
looked for Montaigne’s Essays,

     [This must have been Florio’s translation, as Cotton’s was not
     published until 1685.]

which I heard by my Lord Arlington and Lord Blaney so much commended,
and intend to buy it, but did not now, but home, where at the office
did some business, as much as my eyes would give leave, and so home to
supper, Mercer with us talking and singing, and so to bed. The House, I
hear, have this day concluded upon raising L100,000 of the L300,000
by wine, and the rest by a poll-[tax], and have resolved to excuse the
Church, in expectation that they will do the more of themselves at this
juncture; and I do hear that Sir W. Coventry did make a speech in behalf
of the Clergy.
