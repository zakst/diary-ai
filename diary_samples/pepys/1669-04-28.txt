28th. Up, and was called upon by Sir H. Cholmly to discourse about some
accounts of his, of Tangier: and then other talk; and I find by him that
it is brought almost effect ([through] the late endeavours of the Duke
of York Duchess, the Queen-Mother, and my Lord St. Albans, together
with some of the contrary faction, my Lord Arlington), that for a sum of
money we shall enter into a league with the King of France, wherein, he
says, my Lord Chancellor--[Clarendon; then an exile in France.]--is also
concerned; and that he believes that, in the doing hereof, it is meant
that he [Clarendon] shall come again, and that this sum of money will
so help the King that he will not need the Parliament; and that, in that
regard it will be forwarded by the Duke of Buckingham and his faction,
who dread the Parliament. But hereby we must leave the Dutch, and that
I doubt will undo us; and Sir H. Cholmly says he finds W. Coventry do
think the like. Lady Castlemayne is instrumental in this matter, and,
he say never more great with the King than she is now. But this a thing
that will make the Parliament and kingdom mad, and will turn to our
ruine: for with this money the King shall wanton away his time in
pleasures, and think nothing of the main till it be too late. He gone,
I to the office, where busy till noon, and then home to dinner, where W.
Batelier dined with us, and pretty merry, and so I to the office again.
This morning Mr. Sheres sent me, in two volumes, Mariana his History of
Spaine, in Spanish, an excellent book; and I am much obliged for it to
him.
