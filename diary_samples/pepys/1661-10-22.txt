22nd. At the office all the morning, where we had a deputation from the
Duke in his absence, he being gone to Portsmouth, for us to have
the whole disposal and ordering of the Fleet. In the afternoon about
business up and down, and at night to visit Sir R. Slingsby, who is
fallen sick of this new disease, an ague and fever. So home after
visiting my aunt Wight and Mrs. Norbury (who continues still a very
pleasant lady), and to supper, and so to bed.
