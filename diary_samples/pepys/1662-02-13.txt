13th. After musique comes my cozen Tom Pepys the executor, and he did
stay with me above two hours discoursing about the difference between my
uncle Thomas and me, and what way there may be to make it up, and I have
hopes we may do good of it for all this. Then to dinner, and then came
Mr. Kennard, and he and I and Sir W. Pen went up and down his house
to view what may be the contrivance and alterations there to the best
advantage. So home, where Mr. Blackburne (whom I have not seen a long
time) was come to speak with me, and among other discourse he do tell me
plain of the corruption of all our Treasurerâ€™s officers, and that they
hardly pay any money under ten per cent.; and that the other day, for a
mere assignation of L200 to some counties, they took L15 which is very
strange. So to the office till night, and then home and to write by the
post about many businesses, and so to bed. Last night died the Queen of
Bohemia.
