23rd. This morning I went to my father’s, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet. Hence he and I to Dr. Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice’s to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle’s will before him and Dr. Williams, and had
them sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so
he took my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we
were sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted. Dr.
Williams and I to a cook’s where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I
to W. Joyce’s, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the
Opera, and shewed her “The Witts,” which I had seen already twice, and
was most highly pleased with it. So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see
my Lady, and then home.
