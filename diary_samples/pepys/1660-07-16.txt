16th, This morning it proved very rainy weather so that I could not
remove my goods to my house. I to my office and did business there, and
so home, it being then sunrise, but by the time that I got to my house
it began to rain again, so that I could not carry my goods by cart as I
would have done. After that to my Lordâ€™s and so home and to bed.
