17th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon dined at
home, my brother Balty with me, who is fitting himself to go to sea. So
after dinner to my accounts and did proceed a good way in settling
them, and thence to the office, where all the afternoon late, writing
my letters and doing business, but, Lord! what a conflict I had with
myself, my heart tempting me 1000 times to go abroad about some pleasure
or other, notwithstanding the weather foule. However I reproached myself
with my weaknesse in yielding so much my judgment to my sense, and
prevailed with difficulty and did not budge, but stayed within, and, to
my great content, did a great deale of business, and so home to supper
and to bed. This day I am told that Moll Davis, the pretty girle, that
sang and danced so well at the Dukeâ€™s house, is dead.
