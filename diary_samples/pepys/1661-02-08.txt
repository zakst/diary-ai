8th. At the office all the morning. At noon to the Exchange to meet Mr.
Warren the timber merchant, but could not meet with him. Here I met with
many sea commanders, and among others Captain Cuttle, and Curtis, and
Mootham, and I, went to the Fleece Tavern to drink; and there we spent
till four o’clock, telling stories of Algiers, and the manner of the
life of slaves there! And truly Captn. Mootham and Mr. Dawes (who
have been both slaves there) did make me fully acquainted with their
condition there: as, how they eat nothing but bread and water. At their
redemption they pay so much for the water they drink at the public
fountaynes, during their being slaves. How they are beat upon the soles
of their feet and bellies at the liberty of their padron. How they are
all, at night, called into their master’s Bagnard; and there they lie.
How the poorest men do use their slaves best. How some rogues do live
well, if they do invent to bring their masters in so much a week by
their industry or theft; and then they are put to no other work at
all. And theft there is counted no great crime at all. Thence to Mr.
Rawlinson’s, having met my old friend Dick Scobell, and there I drank a
great deal with him, and so home and to bed betimes, my head aching.
