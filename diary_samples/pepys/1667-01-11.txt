11th. Up, being troubled at my being found abed a-days by all sorts
of people, I having got a trick of sitting up later than I need, never
supping, or very seldom, before 12 at night. Then to the office, there
busy all the morning, and among other things comes Sir W. Warren and
walked with me awhile, whose discourse I love, he being a very wise man
and full of good counsel, and his own practices for wisdom much to be
observed, and among other things he tells me how he is fallen in with
my Lord Bruncker, who has promised him most particular inward friendship
and yet not to appear at the board to do so, and he tells me how my Lord
Bruncker should take notice of the two flaggons he saw at my house at
dinner, at my late feast, and merrily, yet I know enviously, said, I
could not come honestly by them. This I am glad to hear, though vexed
to see his ignoble soul, but I shall beware of him, and yet it is fit
he should see I am no mean fellow, but can live in the world, and have
something. At noon home to dinner, and then to the office with my people
and very busy, and did dispatch to my great satisfaction abundance of
business, and do resolve, by the grace of God, to stick to it till I
have cleared my heart of most things wherein I am in arrear in public
and private matters. At night, home to supper and to bed. This day ill
news of my fatherâ€™s being very ill of his old grief the rupture, which
troubles me.
