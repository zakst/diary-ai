17th. This morning come Mr. Lee, Wade, and Evett, intending to have gone
upon our new design to the Tower today; but it raining, and the work
being to be done in the open garden, we put it off to Friday next. And
so I to the office doing business, and then dined at home with my poor
wife with great content, and so to the office again and made an end of
examining the other of Mr. Hollandâ€™s books about the Navy, with which I
am much contented, and so to other businesses till night at my office,
and so home to supper, and after much dear company and talk with my
wife, to bed.
