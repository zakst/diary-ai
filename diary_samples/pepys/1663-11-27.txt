27th. Up and to my office, where busy with great delight all the
morning, and at noon to the â€˜Change, and so home to dinner with my poor
wife, and with great content to my office again, and there hard at work
upon stating the account of the freights due to the King from the East
India Company till late at night, and so home to supper and to bed. My
wife mightily pleased with my late discourse of getting a trip over to
Calais, or some other port of France, the next summer, in one of the
yachts, and I believe I shall do it, and it makes good sport that my
mayde Jane dares not go, and Besse is wild to go, and is mad for joy,
but yet will be willing to stay if Jane hath a mind, which is the best
temper in this and all other things that ever I knew in my life.
