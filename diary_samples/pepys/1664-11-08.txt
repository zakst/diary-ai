8th. Up and to the office, where by and by Mr. Coventry come, and after
doing a little business, took his leave of us, being to go to sea with
the Duke to-morrow. At noon, I and Sir J. Minnes and Lord Barkeley (who
with Sir J. Duncum, and Mr. Chichly, are made Masters of the Ordnance),
to the office of the Ordnance, to discourse about wadding for guns.
Thence to dinner, all of us to the Lieutenant’s of the Tower; where a
good dinner, but disturbed in the middle of it by the King’s coming
into the Tower: and so we broke up, and to him, and went up and down
the store-houses and magazines; which are, with the addition of the
new great store-house, a noble sight. He gone, I to my office, where
Bagwell’s wife staid for me, and together with her a good while, to meet
again shortly. So all the afternoon at my office till late, and then to
bed, joyed in my love and ability to follow my business. This day, Mr.
Lever sent my wife a pair of silver candlesticks, very pretty ones. The
first man that ever presented me, to whom I have not only done little
service, but apparently did him the greatest disservice in his business
of accounts, as Purser-Generall, of any man at the board.
