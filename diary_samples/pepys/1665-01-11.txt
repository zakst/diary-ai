11th. Up, and very angry with my boy for lying long a bed and forgetting
his lute. To my office all the morning. At noon to the â€˜Change, and so
home to dinner. After dinner to Gresham College to my Lord Brunker and
Commissioner Pett, taking, Mr. Castle with me there to discourse over
his draught of a ship he is to build for us. Where I first found reason
to apprehend Commissioner Pett to be a man of an ability extraordinary
in any thing, for I found he did turn and wind Castle like a chicken
in his business, and that most pertinently and mister-like, and great
pleasure it was to me to hear them discourse, I, of late having studied
something thereof, and my Lord Brunker is a very able person also
himself in this sort of business, as owning himself to be a master in
the business of all lines and Conicall Sections: Thence home, where very
late at my office doing business to my content, though [God] knows with
what ado it was that when I was out I could get myself to come home to
my business, or when I was there though late would stay there from
going abroad again. To supper and to bed. This evening, by a letter from
Plymouth, I hear that two of our ships, the Leopard and another, in the
Straights, are lost by running aground; and that three more had like to
have been so, but got off, whereof Captain Allen one: and that a Dutch
fleete are gone thither; which if they should meet with our lame ships,
God knows what would become of them. This I reckon most sad newes;
God make us sensible of it! This night, when I come home, I was much
troubled to hear my poor canary bird, that I have kept these three or
four years, is dead.
