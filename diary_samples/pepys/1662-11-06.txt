6th. At the office forenoon and afternoon till late at night, very busy
answering my Lord Treasurerâ€™s letter, and my mind troubled till we come
to some end with Sir J. Minnes about our lodgings, and so home. And
after some pleasant discourse and supper to bed, and in my dream much
troubled by being with Will. Swan, a great fanatic, my old acquaintance,
and, methought, taken and led up with him for a plotter, all our
discourse being at present about the late plots.
