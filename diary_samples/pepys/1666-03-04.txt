4th (Lordâ€™s day). And all day at my Tangier and private accounts, having
neglected them since Christmas, which I hope I shall never do again;
for I find the inconvenience of it, it being ten times the labour
to remember and settle things. But I thank God I did it at last, and
brought them all fine and right; and I am, I thinke, by all appears to
me (and I am sure I cannot be L10 wrong), worth above L4600, for which
the Lord be praised! being the biggest sum I ever was worth yet.
