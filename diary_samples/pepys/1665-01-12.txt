12th. Up, and to White Hall about getting a privy seal for felling of
the King’s timber for the navy, and to the Lords’ House to speak with
my Lord Privy Seale about it, and so to the ‘Change, where to my last
night’s ill news I met more. Spoke with a Frenchman who was taken, but
released, by a Dutch man-of-war of thirty-six guns (with seven more of
the like or greater ships), off the North Foreland, by Margett. Which
is a strange attempt, that they should come to our teeth; but the wind
being easterly, the wind that should bring our force from Portsmouth,
will carry them away home. God preserve us against them, and pardon our
making them in our discourse so contemptible an enemy! So home and to
dinner, where Mr. Hollyard with us dined. So to the office, and there
late till 11 at night and more, and then home to supper and to bed.
