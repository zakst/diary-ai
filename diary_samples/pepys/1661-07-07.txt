7th (Lord’s day). In the morning my father and I walked in the garden
and read the will; where, though he gives me nothing at present till my
father’s death, or at least very little, yet I am glad to see that he
hath done so well for us, all, and well to the rest of his kindred.
After that done, we went about getting things, as ribbands and gloves,
ready for the burial. Which in the afternoon was done; where, it being
Sunday, all people far and near come in; and in the greatest disorder
that ever I saw, we made shift to serve them what we had of wine and
other things; and then to carry him to the church, where Mr. Taylor
buried him, and Mr. Turners preached a funerall sermon, where he spoke
not particularly of him anything, but that he was one so well known for
his honesty, that it spoke for itself above all that he could say for
it. And so made a very good sermon. Home with some of the company who
supped there, and things being quiet, at night to bed.
