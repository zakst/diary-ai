14th. Up, and to the office, where we held a meeting extraordinary upon
some particular business, and there sat all the morning. At noon, my
wife being gone to the whitster’s again to her clothes, I to dinner to
Sir W. Batten’s, where much of our discourse concerning Carcasse, who it
seems do find success before the Council, and do everywhere threaten us
with what he will prove against us, which do vex us to see that we must
be subjected to such a rogue of our own servants as this is. By and
by to talk of our prize at Hull, and Sir W. Batten offering, again and
again, seriously how he would sell his part for L1000 and I considering
the knavery of Hogg and his company, and the trouble we may have with
the Prince Rupert about the consort ship, and how we are linked with Sir
R. Ford, whose son-in-law too is got thither, and there we intrust him
with all our concern, who I doubt not is of the same trade with his
father-in-law for a knave, and then the danger of the sea, if it shall
be brought about, or bad debts contracted in the sale, but chiefly to be
eased of my fears about all or any of this, I did offer my part to
him for L700. With a little beating the bargain, we come to a perfect
agreement for L666 13s. 4d., which is two-thirds of L1000, which is
my proportion of the prize. I went to my office full of doubts and joy
concerning what I had done; but, however, did put into writing the heads
of our agreement, and returned to Sir W. Batten, and we both signed
them; and Sir R. Ford, being come thither since, witnessed them. So
having put it past further dispute I away, satisfied, and took coach and
to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Country Captain,” which is
a very ordinary play. Methinks I had no pleasure therein at all, and
so home again and to my business hard till my wife come home from her
clothes, and so with her to supper and to bed. No news yet come of the
ratification of the peace which we have expected now every hour since
yesterday.
