6th. In the morning with Sir W. Batten and Pen by water to Westminster,
where at my Lord’s I met with Mr. Creed. With him to see my Lord’s
picture (now almost done), and thence to Westminster Hall, where we
found the Parliament met to-day, and thence meeting with Mr. Chetwind,
I took them to the Sun, and did give them a barrel of oysters, and had
good discourse; among other things Mr. Chetwind told me how he did fear
that this late business of the Duke of York’s would prove fatal to my
Lord Chancellor. From thence Mr. Creed and I to Wilkinson’s, and dined
together, and in great haste thence to our office, where we met all, for
the sale of two ships by an inch of candle

     [The old-fashioned custom of sale by auction by inch of candle was
     continued in sales by the Admiralty to a somewhat late date.  See
