10th. Up, and to the Excise-Office, and thence to White Hall a little,
and so back again to the â€˜Change, but nobody there, it being over, and
so walked home to dinner, and after dinner comes Mr. Seymour to visit
me, a talking fellow: but I hear by him that Captain Trevanion do give
it out every where, that I did overrule the whole Court-martiall against
him, as long as I was there; and perhaps I may receive, this time, some
wrong by it: but I care not, for what I did was out of my desire of
doing justice. So the office, where late, and then home to supper and to
bed.
