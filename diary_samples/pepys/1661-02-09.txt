9th. To my Lord’s with Mr. Creed (who was come to me this morning to get
a bill of imprest signed), and my Lord being gone out he and I to the
Rhenish wine-house with Mr. Blackburne. To whom I did make known my
fears of Will’s losing of his time, which he will take care to give him
good advice about. Afterwards to my Lord’s and Mr. Shepley and I did
make even his accounts and mine. And then with Mr. Creed and two friends
of his (my late landlord Jones’ son one of them), to an ordinary to
dinner, and then Creed and I to Whitefriars’ to the Play-house, and saw
“The Mad Lover,” the first time I ever saw it acted, which I like pretty
well, and home.
