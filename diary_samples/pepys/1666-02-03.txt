3rd. Up, and to the office very busy till 3 oâ€™clock, and then home, all
of us, for half an hour to dinner, and to it again till eight at night,
stating our wants of money for the Duke, but could not finish it. So
broke up, and I to my office, then about letters and other businesses
very late, and so home to supper, weary with business, and to bed.
