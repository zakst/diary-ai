25th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and finished
Sir W. Warrenâ€™s great contract for timber, with great content to me,
because just in the terms I wrote last night to Sir W. Warren and
against the terms proposed by Sir W. Batten. At noon home to dinner,
and there found Creed and Hawley. After dinner comes in Mrs. Ingram, the
first time to make a visit to my wife. After a little stay I left them
and to the Committee of the Fishery, and there did make my report of the
late public collections for the Fishery, much to the satisfaction of the
Committee, and I think much to my reputation, for good notice was taken
of it and much it was commended. So home, in my way taking care of a
piece of plate for Mr. Christopher Pett, against the launching of his
new great ship tomorrow at Woolwich, which I singly did move to His
Royall Highness, and did obtain it for him, to the value of twenty
pieces. And he, under his hand, do acknowledge to me that he did never
receive so great a kindness from any man in the world as from me herein.
So to my office, and then to supper, and then to my office again, where
busy late, being very full now a days of business to my great content,
I thank God, and so home to bed, my house being full of a design, to go
to-morrow, my wife and all her servants, to see the new ship launched.
