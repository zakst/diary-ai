15th. Up betimes, and to my Journall entries, but disturbed by many
businesses, among others by Mr. Houblon’s coming to me about evening
their freight for Tangier, which I did, and then Mr. Bland, who
presented me yesterday with a very fine African mat, to lay upon the
ground under a bed of state, being the first fruits of our peace
with Guyland. So to the office, and thither come my pretty widow Mrs.
Burrows, poor woman, to get her ticket paid for her husband’s service,
which I did her myself, and did ‘baisser her moucher’, and I do hope
may thereafter have some day ‘sa’ company. Thence to Westminster to the
Exchequer, but could not persuade the blockheaded fellows to do what I
desire, of breaking my great tallys into less, notwithstanding my Lord
Treasurer’s order, which vexed [me] so much that I would not bestow more
time and trouble among a company of dunces, and so back again home, and
to dinner, whither Creed come and dined with me and after dinner Mr.
Moore, and he and I abroad, thinking to go down the river together, but
the tide being against me would not, but returned and walked an houre
in the garden, but, Lord! to hear how he pleases himself in behalf of
my Lord Sandwich, in the miscarriage of the Duke of Albemarle, and do
inveigh against Sir W. Coventry as a cunning knave, but I thinke that
without any manner of reason at all, but only his passion. He being gone
I to my chamber at home to set my Journall right and so to settle
my Tangier accounts, which I did in very good order, and then in the
evening comes Mr. Yeabsly to reckon with me, which I did also, and have
above L200 profit therein to myself, which is a great blessing, the
God of heaven make me thankfull for it. That being done, and my eyes
beginning to be sore with overmuch writing, I to supper and to bed.
