2nd. To the office, where all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and
then abroad to my Lord Treasurer’s, who continues so ill as not to be
troubled with business. So Mr. Gawden and I to my Lord Ashly’s and spoke
with him, and then straight home, and there I did much business at the
office, and then to my own chamber and did the like there, to my great
content, but to the pain of my eyes, and then to supper and to bed,
having a song with my wife with great pleasure, she doing it well.
