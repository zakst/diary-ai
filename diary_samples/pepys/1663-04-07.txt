7th. Up very betimes, and angry with Will that he made no more haste to
rise after I called him. So to my office, and all the morning there. At
noon to the Exchange, and so home to dinner, where I found my wife had
been with Ashwell to La Rocheâ€™s to have her tooth drawn, which it seems
aches much, but my wife could not get her to be contented to have it
drawn after the first twich, but would let it alone, and so they came
home with it undone, which made my wife and me good sport. After dinner
to the office, where Sir J. Minnes did make a great complaint to me
alone, how my clerk Mr. Hater had entered in one of the Sea books a
ticket to have been signed by him before it had been examined, which
makes the old fool mad almost, though there was upon enquiry the
greatest reason in the world for it. Which though it vexes me, yet it
is most to see from day to day what a coxcomb he is, and that so great a
trust should lie in the hands of such a fool. We sat all the afternoon,
and I late at my office, it being post night, and so home to supper, my
father being come again to my house, and after supper to bed, and after
some talk to sleep.
