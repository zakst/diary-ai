20th. Up, and all the morning at the office, and then home to dinner,
and after dinner out with my wife and my two girls to the Duke of York’s
house, and there saw “The Gratefull Servant,” a pretty good play, and
which I have forgot that ever I did see. And thence with them to Mrs.
Gotier’s, the Queen’s tire-woman, for a pair of locks for my wife; she
is an oldish French woman, but with a pretty hand as most I have seen;
and so home, and to supper, W. Batelier and W. Hewer with us, and so my
cold being great, and greater by my having left my coat at my tailor’s
to-night and come home in a thinner that I borrowed there, I went to bed
before them and slept pretty well.
