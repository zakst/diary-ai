3rd. All the morning, business at the office, dined at home, then in the
afternoon set my wife down at the Exchange, and I to St. James’s, and
there attended the Duke of York about the list of ships that we propose
to sell: and here there attended Mr. Wren the first time, who hath not
yet, I think, received the Duke of York’s seal and papers. At our coming
hither, we found the Duke and Duchesse all alone at dinner, methought
melancholy; or else I thought so, from the late occasion of the
Chancellor’s fall, who, they say, however, takes it very contentedly.
Thence I to White Hall a little, and so took up my wife at the ‘Change,
and so home, and at the office late, and so home to supper and to bed,
our boy ill.
