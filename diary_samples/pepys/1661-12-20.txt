20th. Lay long in bed, and then up, and so to the Wardrobe to dinner,
and from thence out with Mr. Moore towards my house, and in our way met
with Mr. Swan (my old acquaintance), and we to a tavern, where we had
enough of his old simple religious talk, and he is still a coxcomb
in these things as he ever was, and tells me he is setting out a book
called “The unlawfull use of lawfull things;” but a very simple fellow
he is, and so I leave him. So we drank and at last parted, and Mr. Moore
and I into Cornhill, it being dark night, and in the street and on the
Exchange discoursed about Dominion of the Sea, wherein I am lately so
much concerned, and so I home and sat late up reading of Mr. Selden, and
so to bed.
