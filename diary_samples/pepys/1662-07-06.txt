6th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay long in bed to-day with my wife merry and
pleasant, and then rose and settled my accounts with my wife for
housekeeping, and do see that my kitchen, besides wine, fire, candle,
sope, and many other things, comes to about 30s. a week, or a little
over. To church, where Mr. Mills made a lazy sermon. So home to dinner,
where my brother Tom dined with me, and so my wife and I to church again
in the afternoon, and that done I walked to the Wardrobe and spent
my time with Mr. Creed and Mr. Moore talking about business; so up to
supper with my Lady [Sandwich], who tells me, with much trouble, that
my Lady Castlemaine is still as great with the King, and that the King
comes as often to her as ever he did, at which, God forgive me, I am
well pleased. It began to rain, and so I borrowed a hat and cloak of Mr.
Moore and walked home, where I found Captain Ferrer with my wife, and
after speaking a matter of an hour with him he went home and we all to
bed. Jack Cole, my old friend, found me out at the Wardrobe; and, among
other things, he told me that certainly most of the chief ministers of
London would fling up their livings; and that, soon or late, the issue
thereof would be sad to the King and Court.
