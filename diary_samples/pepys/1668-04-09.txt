9th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning sitting, then at noon
home to dinner with my people, and so to the office again writing of my
letters, and then abroad to my bookseller’s, and up and down to the Duke
of York’s playhouse, there to see, which I did, Sir W. Davenant’s corpse
carried out towards Westminster, there to be buried. Here were many
coaches and six horses, and many hacknies, that made it look, methought,
as if it were the buriall of a poor poet. He seemed to have many
children, by five or six in the first mourning-coach, all boys. And
there I left them coming forth, and I to the New Exchange, there to meet
Mrs. Burroughs, and did take her in a carosse and carry elle towards the
Park, kissing her..., but did not go into any house, but come back
and set her down at White Hall, and did give her wrapt in paper for my
Valentine’s gift for the last year before this, which I never did yet
give her anything for, twelve half-crowns, and so back home and there
to my office, where come a packet from the Downes from my brother Balty,
who, with Harman, is arrived there, of which this day come the first
news. And now the Parliament will be satisfied, I suppose, about the
business they have so long desired between Brouncker and Harman about
not prosecuting the first victory. Balty is very well, and I hope hath
performed his work well, that I may get him into future employment. I
wrote to him this night, and so home, and there to the perfecting
my getting the scale of musique without book, which I have done to
perfection backward and forward, and so to supper and to bed.
