3rd. Up betimes, and by water with W. Hewer to White Hall, and there
to Mr. Wren, who gives me but small hopes of the favour I hoped for Mr.
Steventon, Will’s uncle, of having leave, being upon the point of death,
to surrender his place, which do trouble me, but I will do what I can.
So back again to the Office, Sir Jer. Smith with me; who is a silly,
prating, talking man; but he tells me what he hears, that Holmes and
Spragg now rule all with the Duke of Buckingham, as to seabusiness, and
will be great men: but he do prophesy what will be the fruit of it; so I
do. So to the Office, where we sat all the morning; and at noon home
to dinner, and then abroad again, with my wife, to the Duke of York’s
playhouse, and saw “The Unfortunate Lovers;” a mean play, I think, but
some parts very good, and excellently acted. We sat under the boxes,
and saw the fine ladies; among others, my Lady Kerneguy, a who is most
devilishly painted. And so home, it being mighty pleasure to go alone
with my poor wife, in a coach of our own, to a play, and makes us appear
mighty great, I think, in the world; at least, greater than ever I
could, or my friends for me, have once expected; or, I think, than ever
any of my family ever yet lived, in my memory, but my cozen Pepys in
Salisbury Court. So to the office, and thence home to supper and to bed.
