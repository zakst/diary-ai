10th. Up, and to attend the Council, but all in vain, the Council
spending all the morning upon a business about the printing of the
Critickes, a dispute between the first Printer, one Bee that is dead,
and the Abstractor, who would now print his Abstract, one Poole. So home
to dinner, and thence to Haward’s to look upon an Espinette, and I did
come near the buying one, but broke off. I have a mind to have one. So
to Cooper’s; and there find my wife and W. Hewer and Deb., sitting, and
painting; and here he do work finely, though I fear it will not be so
like as I expected: but now I understand his great skill in musick,
his playing and setting to the French lute most excellently; and speaks
French, and indeed is an excellent man. Thence, in the evening, with my
people in a glass hackney-coach to the park, but was ashamed to be seen.
So to the lodge, and drank milk, and so home to supper and to bed.
