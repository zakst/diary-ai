22nd. Up, and to the Office, where sitting all the morning at noon, home
to dinner, with my people, and so to the Office again, where busy all
the afternoon, and in the evening spent my time walking in the dark, in
the garden, to favour my eyes, which I find nothing but ease to help.
In the garden there comes to me my Lady Pen and Mrs. Turner and Markham,
and we sat and talked together, and I carried them home, and there eat
a bit of something, and by and by comes Sir W. Pen, and eat with us, and
mighty merry-in appearance, at least, he being on all occasions glad
to be at friendship with me, though we hate one another, and know it on
both sides. They gone, Mrs. Turner and I to walk in the garden.... So
led her home, and I back to bed. This day Mr. Wren did give me, at
the Board, Commissioner Middleton’s answer to the Duke of York’s great
letter; so that now I have all of them.
