15th (Lord’s day). This morning my wife did wake me being frighted with
the noise I made in my sleep, being a dream that one of our sea maisters
did desire to see the St. John’s Isle of my drawing, which methought
I showed him, but methought he did handle it so hard that it put me to
very horrid pain.... Which what a strange extravagant dream it was. So
to sleep again and lay long in bed, and then trimmed by the barber, and
so sending Will to church, myself staid at home, hanging up in my green
chamber my picture of the Soveraigne, and putting some things in order
there. So to dinner, to three more ducks and two teals, my wife and
I. Then to Church, where a dull sermon, and so home, and after walking
about the house awhile discoursing with my wife, I to my office there to
set down something and to prepare businesses for tomorrow, having in the
morning read over my vows, which through sicknesse I could not do the
last Lord’s day, and not through forgetfulness or negligence, so that
I hope it is no breach of my vow not to pay my forfeiture. So home, and
after prayers to bed, talking long with my wife and teaching her things
in astronomy.
