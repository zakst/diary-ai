18th. All the morning at my office; then to the Exchange (with my Lord
Bruncker in his coach) at noon, but it was only to avoid Mr. Chr. Pett’s
being invited by me to dinner. So home, calling at my little mercer’s
in Lumbard Streete, who hath the pretty wench, like the old Queene, and
there cheapened some stuffs to hang my roome, that I intend to turn into
a closett. So home to dinner, and after dinner comes Creed to discourse
with me about several things of Tangier concernments and accounts, among
others starts the doubt, which I was formerly aware of, but did wink at
it, whether or no Lanyon and his partners be not paid for more than they
should be, which he presses, so that it did a little discompose me;
but, however, I do think no harm will arise thereby. He gone, I to the
office, and there very late, very busy, and so home to supper and to
bed.
