16th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, my wife coming
home from the water this morning, having lain with them on board “The
Prince” all night. At noon home to dinner, where my wife told me the
unpleasant journey she had yesterday among the children, whose fear upon
the water and folly made it very unpleasing to her. A good dinner, and
then to the office again. This afternoon Mr. Harris, the sayle-maker,
sent me a noble present of two large silver candlesticks and snuffers,
and a slice to keep them upon, which indeed is very handsome. At night
come Mr. Andrews with L36, the further fruits of my Tangier contract,
and so to bed late and weary with business, but in good content of mind,
blessing God for these his benefits.
