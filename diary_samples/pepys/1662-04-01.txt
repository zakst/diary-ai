April 1st. Within all the morning and at the office. At noon my wife and
I (having paid our maid Nell her whole wages, who has been with me half
a year, and now goes away for altogether) to the Wardrobe, where my
Lady and company had almost dined. We sat down and dined. Here was Mr.
Herbert, son to Sir Charles Herbert, that lately came with letters from
my Lord Sandwich to the King. After some discourse we remembered one
another to have been together at the tavern when Mr. Fanshaw took his
leave of me at his going to Portugall with Sir Richard. After dinner he
and I and the two young ladies and my wife to the playhouse, the Opera,
and saw “The Mayde in the Mill,” a pretty good play. In the middle of
the play my Lady Paulina, who had taken physique this morning, had need
to go forth, and so I took the poor lady out and carried her to the
Grange, and there sent the maid of the house into a room to her, and
she did what she had a mind to, and so back again to the play; and that
being done, in their coach I took them to Islington, and then, after
a walk in the fields, I took them to the great cheese-cake house and
entertained them, and so home, and after an hour’s stay with my Lady,
their coach carried us home, and so weary to bed.
