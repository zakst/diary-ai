October 1st. Early to my Lord to Whitehall, and there he did give me
some work to do for him, and so with all haste to the office. Dined at
home, and my father by chance with me. After dinner he and I advised
about hangings for my rooms, which are now almost fit to be hung, the
painters beginning to do their work to-day. After dinner he and I to the
Miter, where with my uncle Wight (whom my father fetched thither), while
I drank a glass of wine privately with Mr. Mansell, a poor Reformado of
the Charles, who came to see me. Here we staid and drank three or four
pints of wine and so parted. I home to look after my workmen, and at
night to bed. The Commissioners are very busy disbanding of the army,
which they say do cause great robbing. My layings out upon my house an
furniture are so great that I fear I shall not be able to go through
them without breaking one of my bags of L100, I having but L200 yet in
the world.
