25th. It being a fine, light, moonshine morning, and so home round the
city, and stopped and dropped money at five or six places, which I was
the willinger to do, it being Christmas-day, and so home, and there find
my wife in bed, and Jane and the maids making pyes, and so I to bed, and
slept well, and rose about nine, and to church, and there heard a dull
sermon of Mr. Mills, but a great many fine people at church; and so
home. Wife and girl and I alone at dinner--a good Christmas dinner, and
all the afternoon at home, my wife reading to me “The History of the
Drummer of Mr. Mompesson,” which is a strange story of spies, and worth
reading indeed. In the evening comes Mr. Pelling, and he sat and supped
with us; and very good company, he reciting to us many copies of good
verses of Dr. Wilde, who writ “Iter Boreale,” and so to bed, my boy
being gone with W. Hewer and Mr. Hater to Mr. Gibson’s in the country to
dinner and lie there all night.
