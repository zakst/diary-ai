18th. Wake betimes and talk a while with my wife about a wench that she
has hired yesterday, which I would have enquired of before she comes,
she having lived in great families, and so up and to my office, where
all the morning, and at noon home to dinner. After dinner by water to
Redriffe, my wife and Ashwell with me, and so walked and left them at
Halfway house; I to Deptford, where up and down the store-houses, and
on board two or three ships now getting ready to go to sea, and so
back, and find my wife walking in the way. So home again, merry with our
Ashwell, who is a merry jade, and so awhile to my office, and then
home to supper, and to bed. This day my tryangle, which was put in tune
yesterday, did please me very well, Ashwell playing upon it pretty well.
