21st. Up early, and, with Sir R. Slingsby (and Major Waters the deaf
gentleman, his friend, for company’s sake) to the Victualling-office
(the first time that I ever knew where it was), and there staid while he
read a commission for enquiry into some of the King’s lands and houses
thereabouts, that are given his brother. And then we took boat to
Woolwich, where we staid and gave order for the fitting out of some more
ships presently. And then to Deptford, where we staid and did the same;
and so took barge again, and were overtaken by the King in his barge, he
having been down the river with his yacht this day for pleasure to try
it; and, as I hear, Commissioner Pett’s do prove better than the Dutch
one, and that that his brother built. While we were upon the water, one
of the greatest showers of rain fell that ever I saw. The Comptroller
and I landed with our barge at the Temple, and from thence I went to my
father’s, and there did give order about some clothes to be made, and
did buy a new hat, cost between 20 and 30 shillings, at Mr. Holden’s. So
home.
