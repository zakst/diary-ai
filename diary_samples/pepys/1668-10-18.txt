18th (Lord’s day). Up, and with my boy Tom all the morning altering the
places of my pictures with great pleasure, and at noon to dinner, and
then comes Mr. Shales to see me, and I with him to recommend him to my
Lord Brouncker’s service, which I did at Madam Williams’s, and my Lord
receives him. Thence with Brouncker to Lincolne’s Inn, and Mr. Ball,
to visit Dr. Wilkins, now newly Bishop of Chester: and he received us
mighty kindly; and had most excellent discourse from him about his Book
of Reall Character: and so I with Lord Brouncker to White Hall, and
there saw the Queen and some ladies, and with Lord Brouncker back, it
again being a rainy evening, and so my Lord forced to lend me his coach
till I got a hackney, which I did, and so home and to supper, and got my
wife to read to me, and so to bed.
