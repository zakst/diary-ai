14th. Called out in the morning by Mr. Moore, whose voice my wife
hearing in my dressing-chamber with me, got herself ready, and came down
and challenged him for her valentine, this being the day.

     [The practice of choosing valentines was very general at this time,
     but some of the best examples of the custom are found in this
     Diary.]

To Westminster Hall, there being many new remonstrances and declarations
from many counties to Monk and the City, and one coming from the North
from Sir Thomas Fairfax. Hence I took him to the Swan and gave him his
morning draft. So to my office, where Mr. Hill of Worcestershire came
to see me and my partner in our office, with whom we went to Will’s to
drink. At noon I went home and so to Mr. Crew’s, but they had dined, and
so I went to see Mrs. Jem where I stayed a while, and home again where
I stayed an hour or two at my lute, and so forth to Westminster Hall,
where I heard that the Parliament hath now changed the oath so much
talked of to a promise; and that among other qualifications for the
members that are to be chosen, one is, that no man, nor the son of
any man that hath been in arms during the life of the father, shall be
capable of being chosen to sit in Parliament. To Will’s, where like a
fool I staid and lost 6d. at cards. So home, and wrote a letter to my
Lord by the post. So after supper to bed. This day, by an order of the
House, Sir H. Vane was sent out of town to his house in Lincolnshire.
