9th. Up, and to the office, having first been visited by my cozen
Anthony Joyce about the L350 which he desires me to lend him, and which
I have a mind enough to do, but would have it in my power to call it out
again in a little time, and so do take a little further time to consider
it. So to the office, where all the morning busy, and so home at noon to
dinner with my people, where Mr. Hollier come and dined with me, and
it is still mighty pleasant to hear him talk of Rome and the Pope, with
what hearty zeal and hatred he talks against him. After dinner to the
office again, where busy till night, very busy, and among other things
wrote to my father about lending Anthony Joyce the money he desires; and
I declare that I would do it as part of Pallâ€™s portion, and that Pall
should have the use of the money till she be married, but I do propose
to him to think of Mr. Cumberland rather than this Jackson that he is
upon; and I confess I have a mighty mind to have a relation so able a
man, and honest, and so old an acquaintance as Mr. Cumberland. I shall
hear his answer by the next [post]. At night home and to cards with my
wife and girle, and to supper late, and so to bed.
