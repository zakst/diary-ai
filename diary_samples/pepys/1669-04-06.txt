6th. Up, and to the Office, and thence to the Excise Office about some
business, and so back to the office and sat till late, end thence to Mr.
Batelier’s to dinner, where my cozen Turner and both her daughters,
and Talbot Pepys and my wife, and a mighty fine dinner. They at dinner
before I come; and, when I had dined, I away home, and thence to White
Hall, where the Board waited on the Duke of York to discourse about
the disposing of Sir Thomas Allen’s fleete, which is newly come home
to Portsmouth; and here Middleton and I did in plain terms acquaint
the Duke of York what we thought and had observed in the late
Court-martiall, which the Duke did give ear to; and though he thinks not
fit to revoke what is already done in this case by a Court-martiall,
yet it shall bring forth some good laws in the behaviour of Captains to
their under Officers for the time to come. Thence home, and there, after
a while at the Office, I home, and there come home my wife, who hath
been with Batelier’s late, and been dancing with the company, at which
I seemed a little troubled, not being sent for thither myself, but I was
not much so, but went to bed well enough pleased.
