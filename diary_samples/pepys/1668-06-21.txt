21st (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, and home and dined with my wife
and Deb. alone, but merry and in good humour, which is, when all is
done, the greatest felicity of all, and after dinner she to read in the
“Illustre Bassa” the plot of yesterday’s play, which is most exactly the
same, and so to church I alone, and thence to see Sir W. Pen, who is ill
again, and then home, and there get my wife to read to me till supper,
and then to bed.
