2nd. Up and to the office, and there sitting all the morning, and at
noon to the ‘Change, in my going met with Luellin and told him how I had
received a letter and bill for L50 from Mr. Deering, and delivered it
to him, which he told me he would receive for me. To which I consented,
though professed not to desire it if he do not consider himself
sufficiently able by the service I have done, and that it is rather my
desire to have nothing till he be further sensible of my service. From
the ‘Change I brought him home and dined with us, and after dinner I
took my wife out, for I do find that I am not able to conquer myself as
to going to plays till I come to some new vowe concerning it, and that I
am now come, that is to say, that I will not see above one in a month
at any of the publique theatres till the sum of 50s. be spent, and then
none before New Year’s Day next, unless that I do become worth L1000
sooner than then, and then am free to come to some other terms, and so
leaving him in Lombard Street I took her to the King’s house, and there
met Mr. Nicholson, my old colleague, and saw “The Usurper,” which is
no good play, though better than what I saw yesterday. However, we rose
unsatisfied, and took coach and home, and I to the office late writing
letters, and so to supper and to bed.
