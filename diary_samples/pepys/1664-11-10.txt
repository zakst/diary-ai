10th. Up, and not finding my things ready, I was so angry with Besse as
to bid my wife for good and all to bid her provide herself a place,
for though she be very good-natured, she hath no care nor memory of her
business at all. So to the office, where vexed at the malice of Sir
W. Batten and folly of Sir J. Minnes against Sir W. Warren, but I
prevented, and shall do, though to my own disquiet and trouble. At
noon dined with Sir W. Batten and the Auditors of the Exchequer at
the Dolphin by Mr. Wayth’s desire, and after dinner fell to business
relating to Sir G. Carteret’s account, and so home to the office, where
Sir W. Batten begins, too fast, to shew his knavish tricks in giving
what price he pleases for commodities. So abroad, intending to have
spoke with my Lord Chancellor about the old business of his wood at
Clarendon, but could not, and so home again, and late at my office, and
then home to supper and bed. My little girle Susan is fallen sicke of
the meazles, we fear, or, at least, of a scarlett feavour.
