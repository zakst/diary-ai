21st. Up betimes, and with my people again to work, and finished all
before noon: and then I by water to White Hall, and there did tell the
Duke of York that I had done; and he hath to my great content desired
me to come to him at Sunday next in the afternoon, to read it over, by
which I have more time to consider and correct it. So back home and to
the ‘Change, in my way calling at Morris’, my vintner’s, where I love
to see su moher, though no acquaintance accostais this day con her. Did
several things at the ‘Change, and so home to dinner. After dinner I by
coach to my bookseller’s in Duck Lane, and there did spend a little
time and regarder su moher, and so to St. James’s, where did a little
ordinary business; and by and by comes Monsieur Colbert, the French
Embassador, to make his first visit to the Duke of York, and then to the
Duchess: and I saw it: a silly piece of ceremony, he saying only a few
formal words. A comely man, and in a black suit and cloak of silk, which
is a strange fashion, now it hath been so long left off: This day I did
first see the Duke of York’s room of pictures of some Maids of Honour,
done by Lilly: good, but not like.

     [The set of portraits known as “King Charles’s Beauties,” formerly
     in Windsor Castle, but now at Hampton Court.--B.]

Thence to Reeves’s, and bought a reading-glass, and so to my
bookseller’s again, there to buy a Book of Martyrs,

     [The popular name of John Fox’s “Acts and Monuments,” first
     published in 1562-63.]

which I did agree for; and so, after seeing and beginning acquaintance
con his femme, but very little, away home, and there busy very late at
the correcting my great letter to the Duke of York, and so to bed.
