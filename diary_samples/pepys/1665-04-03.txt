3rd. Up and to the Duke of Albemarle and White Hall, where much
business. Thence home and to dinner, and then with Creed, my wife, and
Mercer to a play at the Duke’s, of my Lord Orrery’s, called “Mustapha,”
 which being not good, made Betterton’s part and Ianthe’s but ordinary
too, so that we were not contented with it at all. Thence home and to
the office a while, and then home to supper and to bed. All the pleasure
of the play was, the King and my Lady Castlemayne were there; and
pretty witty Nell,--[Nell Gwynne]--at the King’s house, and the younger
Marshall sat next us; which pleased me mightily.
