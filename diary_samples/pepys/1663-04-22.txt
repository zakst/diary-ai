22nd. Up betimes and to my office very busy all the morning there,
entering things into my Book Manuscript, which pleases me very much.
So to the Change, and so to my uncle Wight’s, by invitation, whither my
father, wife, and Ashwell came, where we had but a poor dinner, and
not well dressed; besides, the very sight of my aunt’s hands and greasy
manner of carving, did almost turn my stomach. After dinner by coach
to the King’s Playhouse, where we saw but part of “Witt without mony,”
 which I do not like much, but coming late put me out of tune, and it
costing me four half-crowns for myself and company. So, the play done,
home, and I to my office a while and so home, where my father (who is so
very melancholy) and we played at cards, and so to supper and to bed.
