September 1st. Up and at the office all the morning, and then dined at
home. Got my new closet made mighty clean against to-morrow. Sir W. Pen
and my wife and Mercer and I to “Polichinelly,” but were there horribly
frighted to see Young Killigrew come in with a great many more young
sparks; but we hid ourselves, so as we think they did not see us. By
and by, they went away, and then we were at rest again; and so, the play
being done, we to Islington, and there eat and drank and mighty merry;
and so home singing, and, after a letter or two at the office, to bed.
