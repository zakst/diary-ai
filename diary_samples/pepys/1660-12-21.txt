21st. By water to Whitehall (leaving my wife at Whitefriars going to my
father’s to buy her a muff and mantle), there I signed many things at
the Privy Seal, and carried L200 from thence to the Exchequer, and laid
it up with Mr. Hales, and afterwards took him and W. Bowyer to the Swan
and drank with them. They told me that this is St. Thomas’s [day], and
that by an old custom, this day the Exchequer men had formerly, and do
intend this night to have a supper; which if I could I promised to
come to, but did not. To my Lady’s, and dined with her: she told me how
dangerously ill the Princess Royal is and that this morning she was said
to be dead. But she hears that she hath married herself to young
Jermyn, which is worse than the Duke of York’s marrying the Chancellor’s
daughter, which is now publicly owned. After dinner to the office all
the afternoon. At seven at night I walked through the dirt to Whitehall
to see whether my Lord be come to town, and I found him come and at
supper, and I supped with him. He tells me that my aunt at Brampton has
voided a great stone (the first time that ever I heard she was troubled
therewith) and cannot possibly live long, that my uncle is pretty well,
but full of pain still. After supper home and to bed.
