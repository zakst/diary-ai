22nd. Up and at the office all the morning. To the ‘Change at noon, and
among other things discoursed with Sir William Warren what I might do
to get a little money by carrying of deales to Tangier, and told him the
opportunity I have there of doing it, and he did give me some advice,
though not so good as he would have done at any other time of the year,
but such as I hope to make good use of, and get a little money by. So to
Sir G. Carteret’s to dinner, and he and I and Captain Cocke all alone,
and good discourse, and thence to a Committee of Tangier at White Hall,
and so home, where I found my wife not well, and she tells me she thinks
she is with child, but I neither believe nor desire it. But God’s will
be done! So to my office late, and home to supper and to bed; having got
a strange cold in my head, by flinging off my hat at dinner, and sitting
with the wind in my neck.

     [In Lord Clarendon’s Essay, “On the decay of respect paid to Age,”
      he says that in his younger days he never kept his hat on before
     those older than himself, except at dinner.--B.]
