15th. With my workmen all day till the afternoon, and then to the
office, where Mr. Creed’s accounts were passed. Home and found all my
joyner’s work now done, but only a small job or two, which please
me very well. This afternoon there came two men with an order from a
Committee of Lords to demand some books of me out of the office, in
order to the examining of Mr. Hutchinson’s accounts, but I give them
a surly answer, and they went away to complain, which put me into some
trouble with myself, but I resolve to go to-morrow myself to these Lords
and answer them. To bed, being in great fear because of the shavings
which lay all up and down the house and cellar, for fear of fire.
