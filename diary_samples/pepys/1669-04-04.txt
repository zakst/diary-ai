4th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where Alderman Backewell’s wife,
by my invitation with my head, come up with her mother, and sat with
us, and after sermon I did walk with them home, and there left them, and
home to dinner, and after dinner with Sir J. Minnes and T. Middleton to
White Hall, by appointment; and at my Lord Arlington’s the Office did
attend the King and Cabal, to discourse the further quantity of victuals
fit to be declared for, which was 2,000 men for six months; and so
without more ado or stay, there, hearing no news but that Sir Thomas
Allen is to be expected every hour at home with his fleete, or news of
his being gone back to Algier, and so home, where got my wife to read
to me; and so after supper to bed. The Queen-Mother hath been of late
mighty ill, and some fears of her death.
