18th. Up and by and by to my bookseller’s, and there did give thorough
direction for the new binding of a great many of my old books, to make
my whole study of the same binding, within very few. Thence to my Lady
Sandwich’s, who sent for me this morning. Dined with her, and it was to
get a letter of hers conveyed by a safe hand to my Lord’s owne hand at
Portsmouth, which I did undertake. Here my Lady did begin to talk of
what she had heard concerning Creed, of his being suspected to be a
fanatique and a false fellow. I told her I thought he was as shrewd and
cunning a man as any in England, and one that I would feare first should
outwit me in any thing. To which she readily concurred. Thence to Mr.
Povy’s by agreement, and there with Mr. Sherwin, Auditor Beale, and
Creed and I hard at it very late about Mr. Povy’s accounts, but such
accounts I never did see, or hope again to see in my days. At night,
late, they gone, I did get him to put out of this account our sums that
are in posse only yet, which he approved of when told, but would never
have stayed it if I had been gone. Thence at 9 at night home, and so to
supper vexed and my head akeing and to bed.
