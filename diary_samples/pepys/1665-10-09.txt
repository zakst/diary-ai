9th. Up, my head full of business, and called upon also by Sir John
Shaw, to whom I did give a civil answer about our prize goods, that all
his dues as one of the Farmers of the Customes are paid, and showed
him our Transire; with which he was satisfied, and parted, ordering his
servants to see the weight of them. I to the office, and there found an
order for my coming presently to the Duke of Albemarle, and what should
it be, but to tell me, that, if my Lord Sandwich do not come to towne,
he do resolve to go with the fleete to sea himself, the Dutch, as he
thinks, being in the Downes, and so desired me to get a pleasure boat
for to take him in to-morrow morning, and do many other things, and with
a great liking of me, and my management especially, as that coxcombe
my Lord Craven do tell me, and I perceive it, and I am sure take pains
enough to deserve it. Thence away and to the office at London, where I
did some business about my money and private accounts, and there eat
a bit of goose of Mr. Griffin’s, and so by water, it raining most
miserably, to Greenwich, calling on several vessels in my passage. Being
come there I hear another seizure hath been made of our goods by one
Captain Fisher that hath been at Chatham by warrant of the Duke of
Albemarle, and is come in my absence to Tooker’s and viewed them,
demanding the key of the constable, and so sealed up the door. I to the
house, but there being no officers nor constable could do nothing,
but back to my office full of trouble about this, and there late about
business, vexed to see myself fall into this trouble and concernment in
a thing that I want instruction from my Lord Sandwich whether I should
appear in it or no, and so home to bed, having spent two hours, I and
my boy, at Mr. Glanvill’s removing of faggots to make room to remove our
goods to, but when done I thought it not fit to use it. The newes of the
killing of the [King of] France is wholly untrue, and they say that of
the Pope too.
