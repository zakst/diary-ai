September 1st. Up and all the morning at the office busy, and after
dinner to the office again busy till about four, and then I abroad (my
wife being gone to Hales’s about drawing her hand new in her picture)
and I to see Betty Michell, which I did, but su mari was dentro, and no
pleasure. So to the Fair, and there saw several sights; among others,
the mare that tells money,

     [This is not the first learned horse of which we read.  Shakespeare,
     “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” act i., SC. 2, mentions “the dancing
     horse,”’ and the commentators have added many particulars of Banks’s
     bay horse.]

and many things to admiration; and, among others, come to me, when she
was bid to go to him of the company that most loved a pretty wench in
a corner. And this did cost me 12d. to the horse, which I had flung him
before, and did give me occasion to baiser a mighty belle fille that was
in the house that was exceeding plain, but fort belle. At night going
home I went to my bookseller’s in Duck Lane, and find her weeping in the
shop, so as ego could not have any discourse con her nor ask the reason,
so departed and took coach home, and taking coach was set on by a wench
that was naught, and would have gone along with me to her lodging in
Shoe Lane, but ego did donner her a shilling... and left her, and home,
where after supper, W. Batelier with us, we to bed. This day Mrs. Martin
come to see us, and dined with us.
