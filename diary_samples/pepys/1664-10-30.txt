30th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and this morning put on my new, fine, coloured
cloth suit, with my cloake lined with plush, which is a dear and noble
suit, costing me about L17. To church, and then home to dinner, and
after dinner to a little musique with my boy, and so to church with my
wife, and so home, and with her all the evening reading and at musique
with my boy with great pleasure, and so to supper, prayers, and to bed.
