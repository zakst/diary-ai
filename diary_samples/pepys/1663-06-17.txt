17th. Up before 4 o’clock, which is the hour I intend now to rise at,
and to my office a while, and with great pleasure I fell to my business
again. Anon went with money to my tar merchant to pay for the tar, which
he refuses to sell me; but now the master is come home, and so he speaks
very civilly, and I believe we shall have it with peace. I brought back
my money to my office, and thence to White Hall, and in the garden spoke
to my Lord Sandwich, who is in his gold-buttoned suit, as the mode is,
and looks nobly. Captain Ferrers, I see, is come home from France. I
only spoke one word to him, my Lord being there. He tells me the young
gentlemen are well there; so my Lord went to my Lord Albemarle’s to
dinner, and I by water home and dined alone, and at the office (after
half an hour’s viallin practice after dinner) till late at night, and so
home and to bed. This day I sent my cozen Edward Pepys his Lady, at my
cozen Turner’s, a piece of venison given me yesterday, and Madam Turner
I sent for a dozen bottles of her’s, to fill with wine for her. This day
I met with Pierce the surgeon, who tells me that the King has made peace
between Mr. Edward Montagu and his father Lord Montagu, and that all is
well again; at which; for the family’s sake, I am very glad, but do not
think it will hold long.
