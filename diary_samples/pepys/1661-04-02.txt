2d. Among my workmen early and then along with my wife and Pall to my
Father’s by coach there to have them lie a while till my house be done.
I found my mother alone weeping upon my last night’s quarrel and so left
her, and took my wife to Charing Cross and there left her to see her
mother who is not well. So I into St. James’s Park, where I saw the Duke
of York playing at Pelemele,

     [The game was originally played in the road now styled Pall Mall,
     near St. James’s Square, but at the Restoration when sports came in
     fashion again the street was so much built over, that it became
     necessary to find another ground.  The Mall in St. James’s Park was
     then laid out for the purpose.]

 the first time that ever I saw the sport.  Then to my Lord’s, where I
dined with my Lady, and after we had dined in comes my Lord and Ned
Pickering hungry, and there was not a bit of meat left in the house, the
servants having eat up all, at which my Lord was very angry, and at last
got something dressed. Then to the Privy Seal, and signed some things,
and so to White-fryars and saw “The Little Thiefe,” which is a very
merry and pretty play, and the little boy do very well. Then to my
Father’s, where I found my mother and my wife in a very good mood, and
so left them and went home. Then to the Dolphin to Sir W. Batten, and
Pen, and other company; among others Mr. Delabar; where strange how
these men, who at other times are all wise men, do now, in their drink,
betwitt and reproach one another with their former conditions, and their
actions as in public concernments, till I was ashamed to see it. But
parted all friends at 12 at night after drinking a great deal of wine.
So home and alone to bed.
