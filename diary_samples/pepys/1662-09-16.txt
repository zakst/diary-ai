(who is now one of the most powerful men in England with the King),
their minds were wholly turned. And it is said that my Lord Albemarle
did oppose him most; but that I do believe is only in appearance. He
told me also that most of the Presbyters now begin to wish they had

that will keep all quiet. I took him in the tavern at Puddle dock, but
neither he nor I drank any of the wine we called for, but left it, and
so after discourse parted, and Mr. Townsend not being at home I went to
my brother’s, and there heard how his love matter proceeded, which do
not displease me, and so by water to White Hall to my Lord’s lodgings,
where he being to go to Hinchingbroke to-morrow morning, I staid and
fiddled with Will. Howe some new tunes very pleasant, and then my Lord
came in and had much kind talk with him, and then to bed with Mr. Moore

resolved to rise early and be gone without more speaking to him--
