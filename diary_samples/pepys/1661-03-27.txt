27th. Up early to see my workmen at work. My brother Tom comes to me,
and among other things I looked over my old clothes and did give him a
suit of black stuff clothes and a hat and some shoes. At the office all
the morning, where Sir G. Carteret comes, and there I did get him to
promise me some money upon a bill of exchange, whereby I shall secure
myself of L60 which otherwise I should not know how to get. At noon
I found my stairs quite broke down, that I could not get up but by a
ladder; and my wife not being well she kept her chamber all this day. To
the Dolphin to a dinner of Mr. Harris’s, where Sir Williams both and
my Lady Batten, and her two daughters, and other company, where a great
deal of mirth, and there staid till 11 o’clock at night; and in our
mirth I sang and sometimes fiddled (there being a noise of fiddlers
there), and at last we fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did
in my life, which I did wonder to see myself to do. At last we made
Mingo, Sir W. Batten’s black, and Jack, Sir W. Pen’s, dance, and it
was strange how the first did dance with a great deal of seeming skill.
Home, where I found my wife all day in her chamber. So to bed.
