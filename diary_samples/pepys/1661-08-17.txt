17th. At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning. Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St. James’s Park (where I
had not been a great while), and there found great and very noble
alterations. And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and
to speak loud of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry
to hear, and which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again. So he and I
to the Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the
Opera, and saw “The Witts” again, which I like exceedingly. The Queen
of Bohemia was here, brought by my Lord Craven. So the Captain and I and
another to the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home. Troubled in
mind that I cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much
in love of plays. We have been at a great loss a great while for a
vessel that I sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord’s to Lynn,
and cannot till now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put
into Soale Bay, but to what purpose I know not.
