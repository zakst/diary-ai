22nd. Up by four o’clock to go with Sir W. Batten to Woolwich and Sir
J. Minnes, which we did, though not before 6 or 7 by their laying a-bed.
Our business was to survey the new wharf building there, in order to the
giving more to him that do it (Mr. Randall) than contracted for, but
I see no reason for it, though it be well done, yet no better than
contracted to be. Here we eat and drank at the Clerke of the Cheques,
and in taking water at the Tower gate, we drank a cup of strong water,
which I did out of pure conscience to my health, and I think is not
excepted by my oaths, but it is a thing I shall not do again, hoping
to have no such occasion. After breakfast Mr. Castle and I walked to
Greenwich, and in our way met some gypsys, who would needs tell me my
fortune, and I suffered one of them, who told me many things common as
others do, but bade me beware of a John and a Thomas, for they did seek
to do me hurt, and that somebody should be with me this day se’nnight to
borrow money of me, but I should lend him none. She got ninepence of me.
And so I left them and to Greenwich and so to Deptford, where the two
knights were come, and thence home by water, where I find my closet done
at my office to my mind and work gone well on at home; and Ashwell gone
abroad to her father, my wife having spoken plainly to her. After dinner
to my office, getting my closet made clean and setting some papers in
order, and so in the evening home and to bed. This day Sir W. Batten
tells me that Mr. Newburne (of whom the nickname came up among us
forarse Tom Newburne) is dead of eating cowcumbers, of which, the other
day, I heard another, I think Sir Nicholas Crisp’s son.
