26th. Up by four o’clock; and by the time we were ready, and had eat,
we were called to the coach, where about six o’clock we set out, there
being a man and two women of one company, ordinary people, and one lady
alone, that is tolerably handsome, but mighty well spoken, whom I took
great pleasure in talking to, and did get her to read aloud in a book
she was reading, in the coach, being the King’s Meditations;--[The
meditations on death, and prayers used by Charles I. shortly before his
execution]--and then the boy and I to sing, and so about noon come to
Bishop’s Stafford, to another house than what we were at the other
day, and better used. And here I paid for the reckoning 11s., we dining
together, and pretty merry; and then set out again, sleeping most part
of the way; and got to Bishopsgate Street before eight o’clock, the
waters being now most of them down, and we avoiding the bad way in the
forest by a privy way, which brought us to Hodsden; and so to Tibalds,
that road, which was mighty pleasant. So home, where we find all well,
and brother Balty and his wife looking to the house, she mighty fine,
in a new gold-laced ‘just a cour’. I shifted myself, and so to see Mrs.
Turner, and Mercer appearing over the way, called her in, and sat and
talked, and then home to my house by and by, and there supped and talked
mighty merry, and then broke up and to bed, being a little vexed at what
W. Hewer tells me Sir John Shaw did this day in my absence say at the
Board, complaining of my doing of him injury and the board permitting
it, whereas they had more reason to except against his attributing that
to me alone which I could not do but with their condent and direction,
it being to very good service to the King, and which I shall be proud to
have imputed to me alone. The King I hear come to town last night.
