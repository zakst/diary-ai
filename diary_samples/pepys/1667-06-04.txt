4th. Up, and to the office, and there busy all the morning putting
in order the answering the great letter sent to the office by the new
Commissioners of the Treasury, who demand an account from the King’s
coming in to this day, which we shall do in the best manner we can.
At noon home to dinner, and after dinner comes Mr. Commander to me and
tells me, after all, that I cannot have a lease of the ground for my
coach-house and stable, till a suit in law be ended, about the end of
the old stable now standing, which they and I would have pulled down
to make a better way for a coach. I am a little sorry that I cannot
presently have it, because I am pretty full in my mind of keeping a
coach; but yet, when I think on it again, the Dutch and French both
at sea, and we poor, and still out of order, I know not yet what turns
there may be, and besides, I am in danger of parting with one of my
places, which relates to the Victualling, that brings me by accident
in L800 a year, that is, L300 from the King and L500 from D. Gawden.
I ought to be well contented to forbear awhile, and therefore I am
contented. To the office all the afternoon, where I dispatched much
business to my great content, and then home in the evening, and there
to sing and pipe with my wife, and that being done, she fell all of a
sudden to discourse about her clothes and my humours in not suffering
her to wear them as she pleases, and grew to high words between us, but
I fell to read a book (Boyle’s Hydrostatiques)

     [“Hydrostatical Paradoxes made out by New Experiments” was
     published by the Hon. Robert Boyle in 1666 (Oxford).]

aloud in my chamber and let her talk, till she was tired and vexed that
I would not hear her, and so become friends, and to bed together the
first night after 4 or 5 that she hath lain from me by reason of a great
cold she had got.
