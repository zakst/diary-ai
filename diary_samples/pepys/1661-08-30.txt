30th. At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with
the children, and after dinner up to my Ladyâ€™s bedside, and talked and
laughed a good while. Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French
comedy, which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every
thing else so nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the
while in my mind to be there. Here my wife met with a son of my Lord
Somersett, whom she knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great
countenance, to avoyd further acquaintance. That done, there being
nothing pleasant but the foolery of the farce, we went home.
