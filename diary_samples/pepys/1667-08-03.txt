3rd. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning. Then at noon to
dinner, and to the office again, there to enable myself, by finishing
our great account, to give it to the Lords Commissioners of the
Treasury; which I did, and there was called in to them, to tell them
only the total of our debt of the Navy on the 25th of May last, which
is above L950,000. Here I find them mighty hot in their answer to the
Council-board about our Treasurerâ€™s threepences of the Victualling, and
also against the present farm of the Customes, which they do most highly
inveigh against. So home again by coach, and there hard to work till
very late and my eyes began to fail me, which now upon very little
overworking them they do, which grieves me much. Late home, to supper,
and to bed.
