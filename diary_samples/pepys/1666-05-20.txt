20th (Lord’s day). With my wife to church in the morning. At noon dined
mighty nobly, ourselves alone. After dinner my wife and Mercer by coach
to Greenwich, to be gossip to Mrs. Daniel’s child. I out to Westminster,
and straight to Mrs. Martin’s, and there did what I would with her, she
staying at home all the day for me; and not being well pleased with her
over free and loose company, I away to Westminster Abbey, and there fell
in discourse with Mr. Blagrave, whom I find a sober politique man, that
gets money and increase of places, and thence by coach home, and thence
by water after I had discoursed awhile with Mr. Yeabsly, whom I met and
took up in my coach with me, and who hath this day presented my Lord
Ashly with L100 to bespeak his friendship to him in his accounts now
before us; and my Lord hath received it, and so I believe is as bad, as
to bribes, as what the world says of him. Calling on all the Victualling
ships to know what they had of their complements, and so to Deptford, to
enquire after a little business there, and thence by water back again,
all the way coming and going reading my Lord Bacon’s “Faber Fortunae,”
 which I can never read too often, and so back home, and there find my
wife come home, much pleased with the reception she had there, and she
was godmother, and did hold the child at the Font, and it is called
John. So back again home, and after setting my papers in order and
supping, to bed, desirous to rise betimes in the morning.
