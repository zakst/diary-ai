17th (Wednesday). Rose, and paying the reckoning, 12s. 6d.; servants
and poor, 2s. 6d.; musick, the worst we have had, coming to our
chamber-door, but calling us by wrong names, we lay; so set out with one
coach in company, and through Maydenhead, which I never saw before, to
Colebrooke by noon; the way mighty good; and there dined, and fitted
ourselves a little to go through London, anon. Somewhat out of humour
all day, reflecting on my wifeâ€™s neglect of things, and impertinent
humour got by this liberty of being from me, which she is never to be
trusted with; for she is a fool. Thence pleasant way to London, before
night, and find all very well, to great content; and there to talk with
my wife, and saw Sir W. Pen, who is well again. I hear of the ill news
by the great fire at Barbados. By and by home, and there with my
people to supper, all in pretty good humour, though I find my wife
hath something in her gizzard, that only waits an opportunity of being
provoked to bring up; but I will not, for my content-sake, give it. So I
to bed, glad to find all so well here, and slept well.
