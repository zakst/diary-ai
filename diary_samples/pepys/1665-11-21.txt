21st. Up, and to the office, where all the morning doing business, and
at noon home to dinner and quickly back again to the office, where very
busy all the evening and late sent a long discourse to Mr. Coventry by
his desire about the regulating of the method of our payment of bills
in the Navy, which will be very good, though, it may be, he did ayme
principally at striking at Sir G. Carteret. So weary but pleased with
this business being over I home to supper and to bed.
