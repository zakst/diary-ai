2nd. My wife troubled all last night with the toothache and this
morning. I up and to my office, where busy, and so home to dinner with
my wife, who is better of her tooth than she was, and in the afternoon
by agreement called on by Mr. Bland, and with him to the Ship a
neighbour tavern and there met his antagonist Mr. Custos and his referee
Mr. Clarke a merchant also, and begun the dispute about the freight of a
ship hired by Mr. Bland to carry provisions to Tangier, and the freight
is now demanded, whereas he says that the goods were some spoiled, some
not delivered, and upon the whole demands L1300 of the other, and their
minds are both so high, their demands so distant, and their words
so many and hot against one another that I fear we shall bring it to
nothing. But however I am glad to see myself so capable of understanding
the business as I find I do, and shall endeavour to do Mr. Bland all the
just service I can therein. Here we were in a bad room, which vexed me
most, but we meet at another house next. So at noon I home and to
my office till 9 oâ€™clock, and so home to my wife to keep her company,
arithmetique, then to supper, and to bed, she being well of her tooth
again.
