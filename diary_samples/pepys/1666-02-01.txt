February 1st. Up and to the office, where all the morning till late,
and Mr. Coventry with us, the first time since before the plague, then
hearing my wife was gone abroad to buy things and see her mother and
father, whom she hath not seen since before the plague, and no dinner
provided for me ready, I walked to Captain Cocke’s, knowing my Lord
Bruncker dined there, and there very merry, and a good dinner. Thence my
Lord and his mistresse, Madam Williams, set me down at the Exchange, and
I to Alderman Backewell’s to set all my reckonings straight there, which
I did, and took up all my notes. So evened to this day, and thence to
Sir Robert Viner’s, where I did the like, leaving clear in his hands
just L2000 of my owne money, to be called for when I pleased. Having
done all this I home, and there to the office, did my business there by
the post and so home, and spent till one in the morning in my chamber to
set right all my money matters, and so to bed.
