28th. Waked with great pain in my right ear (which I find myself much
subject to) having taken cold. Up and to my office, where we sat all
the morning, and I dined with Sir W. Batten by chance, being in business
together about a bargain of New England masts. Then to the Temple to
meet my uncle Thomas, who I found there, but my cozen Roger not
being come home I took boat and to Westminster, where I found him in
Parliament this afternoon. The House have this noon been with the
King to give him their reasons for refusing to grant any indulgence
to Presbyters or Papists; which he, with great content and seeming
pleasure, took, saying, that he doubted not but he and they should
agree in all things, though there may seem a difference in judgement,
he having writ and declared for an indulgence: and that he did believe
never prince was happier in a House of Commons, than he was in them.
Thence he and I to my Lord Sandwich, who continues troubled with his
cold. Our discourse most upon the outing of Sir R. Bernard, and my
Lord’s being made Recorder of Huntingdon in his stead, which he seems
well contented with, saying, that it may be for his convenience to have
the chief officer of the town dependent upon him, which is very true.
Thence he and I to the Temple, but my uncle being gone we parted, and I
walked home, and to my office, and at nine o’clock had a good supper of
an oxe’s cheek, of my wife’s dressing and baking, and so to my office
again till past eleven at night, making up my month’s account, and find
that I am at a stay with what I was last, that is L640. So home and to
bed. Coming by, I put in at White Hall, and at the Privy Seal I did see
the docquet by which Sir W. Pen is made the Comptroller’s assistant, as
Sir J. Minnes told me last night, which I must endeavour to prevent.
