January 1st. Up, and presented from Captain Beckford with a noble silver
warming-pan, which I am doubtful whether to take or no. Up, and with W.
Hewer to the New Exchange, and then he and I to the cabinet-shops, to
look out, and did agree, for a cabinet to give my wife for a New-year’s
gift; and I did buy one cost me L11, which is very pretty, of
walnutt-tree, and will come home to-morrow. So back to the old Exchange,
and there met my uncle Wight; and there walked, and met with the
Houblons, and talked with them--gentlemen whom I honour mightily: and so
to my uncle’s, and met my wife; and there, with W. Hewer, we dined
with our family, and had a very good dinner, and pretty merry and after
dinner, my wife and I with our coach to the King’s playhouse, and there
in a box saw “The Mayden Queene.” Knepp looked upon us, but I durst not
shew her any countenance; and, as well as I could carry myself, I found
my wife uneasy there, poor wretch! therefore, I shall avoid that house
as much as I can. So back to my aunt’s, and there supped and talked, and
staid pretty late, it being dry and moonshine, and so walked home, and
to bed in very good humour.
