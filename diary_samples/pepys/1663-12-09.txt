9th. Lay very long in bed for fear of my pain, and then rose and went to
stool (after my wife’s way, who by all means would have me sit long and
upright) very well, and being ready to the office. From thence I was
called by and by to my wife, she not being well. So to her, and found
her in great pain...... So by and by to my office again, and then abroad
to look out a cradle to burn charcoal in at my office, and I found one
to my mind in Newgate Market, and so meeting Hoby’s man in the street,
I spoke to him to serve it in to the office for the King. So home to
dinner, and after talk with my wife, she in bed and pain all day, I to
my office most of the evening, and then home to my wife. This day Mrs.
Russell did give my wife a very fine St. George, in alabaster, which
will set out my wife’s closett mightily. This evening at the office,
after I had wrote my day’s passages, there came to me my cozen Angier
of Cambridge, poor man, making his moan, and obtained of me that I would
send his son to sea as a Reformado, which I will take care to do. But to
see how apt every man is to forget friendship in time of adversity. How
glad was I when he was gone, for fear he should ask me to be bond for
him, or to borrow money of me.
