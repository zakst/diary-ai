13th. At the office all the morning, where my Lord Bruncker moved to
have something wrote in my matter as I desired him last night, and it
was ordered and will be done next sitting. Home with his Lordship to
Mrs. Williams’s, in Covent-Garden, to dinner (the first time I ever
was there), and there met Captain Cocke; and pretty merry, though not
perfectly so, because of the fear that there is of a great encrease
again of the plague this week. And again my Lord Bruncker do tell us,
that he hath it from Sir John Baber; who is related to my Lord Craven,
that my Lord Craven do look after Sir G. Carteret’s place, and do reckon
himself sure of it. After dinner Cocke and I together by coach to the
Exchange, in our way talking of our matters, and do conclude that every
thing must breake in pieces, while no better counsels govern matters
than there seem to do, and that it will become him and I and all men
to get their reckonings even, as soon as they can, and expect all to
breake. Besides, if the plague continues among us another yeare, the
Lord knows what will become of us. I set him down at the ‘Change, and
I home to my office, where late writing letters and doing business, and
thence home to supper and to bed. My head full of cares, but pleased
with my wife’s minding her worke so well, and busying herself about
her house, and I trust in God if I can but clear myself of my Lord
Sandwich’s bond, wherein I am bound with him for L1000 to T. Pepys, I
shall do pretty well, come what will come.
