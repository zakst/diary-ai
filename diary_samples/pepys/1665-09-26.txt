26th. Up by five o’clock and got post horses and so set out for
Greenwich, calling and drinking at Dartford. Being come to Greenwich and
shifting myself I to the office, from whence by and by my Lord Bruncker
and Sir J. Minnes set out toward Erith to take charge of the two East
India shipps, which I had a hand in contriving for the King’s service
and may do myself a good office too thereby. I to dinner with Mr. Wright
to his father-in-law in Greenwich, one of the most silly, harmless,
prating old men that ever I heard in my life. Creed dined with me, and
among other discourses got of me a promise of half that he could get my
Lord Rutherford to give me upon clearing his business, which should not
be less, he says, than L50 for my half, which is a good thing, though
cunningly got of him. By and by Luellin comes, and I hope to get
something of Deering shortly. They being gone, Mr. Wright and I went
into the garden to discourse with much trouble for fear of losing all
the profit and principal of what we have laid out in buying of prize
goods, and therefore puts me upon thoughts of flinging up my interest,
but yet I shall take good advice first. Thence to the office, and after
some letters down to Woolwich, where I have not lain with my wife these
eight days I think, or more. After supper, and telling her my mind in my
trouble in what I have done as to buying’ of these goods, we to bed.
