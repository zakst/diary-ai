18th. By coach with Sir W. Pen; my wife and I toward Westminster,
but seeing Mr. Moore in the street I light and he and I went to Mr.
Battersby’s the minister, in my way I putting in at St. Paul’s, where I
saw the quiristers in their surplices going to prayers, and a few idle
poor people and boys to hear them, which is the first time I have seen
them, and am sorry to see things done so out of order, and there I
received L50 more, which make up L100 that I now have borrowed of him,
and so I did burn the old bond for L50, and paying him the use of it did
make a new bond for the whole L100. Here I dined and had a good dinner,
and his wife a good pretty woman. There was a young Parson at the table
that had got himself drunk before dinner, which troubled me to see.
After dinner to Mr. Bowers at Westminster for my wife, and brought her
to the Theatre to see “Philaster,” which I never saw before, but I found
it far short of my expectations. So by coach home.
