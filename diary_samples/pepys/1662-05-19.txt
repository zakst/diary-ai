19th. Long in bed, sometimes scolding with my wife, and then pleased
again, and at last up, and put on my riding cloth suit, and a camelott
coat new, which pleases me well enough. To the Temple about my
replication, and so to my brother Tom’s, and there hear that my father
will be in town this week. So home, the shops being but some shut and
some open. I hear that the House of Commons do think much that they
should be forced to huddle over business this morning against the

     [To ears accustomed to the official words of speeches from the
     throne at the present day, the familiar tone of the following
     extracts from Charles’s speech to the Commons, on the 1st of March;
     will be amusing: “I will conclude with putting you in mind of the
     season of the year, and the convenience of your being in the
     country, in many respects, for the good and welfare of it; for you
     will find much tares have been sowed there in your absence.  The
     arrival of my wife, who I expect some time this month, and the
     necessity of my own being out of town to meet her, and to stay some
     time before she comes hither, makes it very necessary that the
     Parliament be adjourned before Easter, to meet again in the winter.
 ....  The mention of my wife’s arrival puts me in mind to
     desire you to put that compliment upon her, that her entrance into
     the town may be with more decency than the ways will now suffer it
     to be; and, to that purpose, I pray you would quickly pass such laws
     as are before you, in order to the amending those ways, and that she
     may not find Whitehall surrounded with water.”  Such a bill passed
     the Commons on the 24th June.  From Charles’s Speech, March 1st,
