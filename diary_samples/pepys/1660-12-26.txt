26th. In the morning to Alderman Backwell’s for the candlesticks for Mr.
Coventry, but they being not done I went away, and so by coach to Mr.
Crew’s, and there took some money of Mr. Moore’s for my Lord, and so to
my Lord’s, where I found Sir Thomas Bond (whom I never saw before) with
a message from the Queen about vessells for the carrying over of her
goods, and so with him to Mr. Coventry, and thence to the office (being
soundly washed going through the bridge) to Sir Wm. Batten and Pen (the
last of whom took physic to-day), and so I went up to his chamber, and
there having made an end of the business I returned to White Hall by
water, and dined with my Lady Sandwich, who at table did tell me how
much fault was laid upon Dr. Frazer and the rest of the Doctors, for the
death of the Princess! My Lord did dine this day with Sir Henry Wright,
in order to his going to sea with the Queen. Thence to my father
Bowyer’s where I met my wife, and with her home by water.
