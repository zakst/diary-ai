13th. Up, without being friends with my wife, nor great enemies, being
both quiet and silent. So out to Colvill’s, but he not being come to
town yet, I to Paul’s Church-yarde, to treat with a bookbinder, to come
and gild the backs of all my books, to make them handsome, to stand in
my new presses, when they come. So back again to Colvill’s, and there
did end our treaty, to my full content, about my Exchequer assignment
of L2600 of Sir W. Warren’s, for which I give him L170 to stand to the
hazard of receiving it. So I shall get clear by it L230, which is a very
good jobb. God be praised for it! Having done with him, then he and I
took coach, and I carried him to Westminster, and there set him down,
in our way speaking of several things. I find him a bold man to say any
thing of any body, and finds fault with our great ministers of state
that nobody looks after any thing; and I thought it dangerous to be free
with him, for I do not think he can keep counsel, because he blabs to me
what hath passed between other people and him. Thence I to St. James’s,
and there missed Sir W. Coventry; but taking up Mr. Robinson in my
coach, I towards London, and there in the way met Sir W. Coventry, and
followed him to White Hall, where a little discourse very kind, and so
I away with Robinson, and set him down at the ‘Change, and thence I to
Stokes the goldsmith, and sent him to and again to get me L1000 in gold;
and so home to dinner, my wife and I friends, without any words almost
of last night. After dinner, I abroad to Stokes, and there did receive
L1000 worth in gold, paying 18 1/2d. and 19d. for others exchange. Home
with them, and there to my office to business, and anon home in the
evening, there to settle some of my accounts, and then to supper and to
bed.
