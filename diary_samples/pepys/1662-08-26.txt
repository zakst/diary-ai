26th. Up betimes and among my works and workmen, and with great pleasure
seeing them go on merrily, and a good many hands, which I perceive makes
good riddance, and so to the office, where we sat all the morning, and
at noon dined alone with Sir W. Batten, which I have not done a great
while, but his lady being out of the way I was the willinger to do it,
and after dinner he and I by water to Deptford, and there found Sir
G. Carteret and my Lady at dinner, and so we sat down and eat another
dinner of venison with them, and so we went to the payhouse, and there
staid till to o’clock at night paying off the Martin and Kinsale, being
small but troublesome ships to pay, and so in the dark by water home to
the Custom House, and so got a lanthorn to light us home, there being
Mr. Morrice the wine cooper with us, he having been at Deptford to view
some of the King’s casks we have to sell. So to bed.
