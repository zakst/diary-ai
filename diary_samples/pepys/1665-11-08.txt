8th. Up, and to the office, where busy among other things to looke my
warrants for the settling of the Victualling business, the warrants
being come to me for the Surveyors of the ports and that for me also to
be Surveyor-Generall. I did discourse largely with Tom Willson about it
and doubt not to make it a good service to the King as well, as the
King gives us very good salarys. It being a fast day, all people were
at church and the office quiett; so I did much business, and at noon
adventured to my old lodging, and there eat, but am not yet well
satisfied, not seeing of Christopher, though they say he is abroad.
Thence after dinner to the office again, and thence am sent for to the
King’s Head by my Lord Rutherford, who, since I can hope for no more
convenience from him, his business is troublesome to me, and therefore I
did leave him as soon as I could and by water to Deptford, and there
did order my matters so, walking up and down the fields till it was
dark night, that ‘je allais a la maison of my valentine,--[Bagwell’s
wife]--and there ‘je faisais whatever je voudrais avec’ her, and, about
eight at night, did take water, being glad I was out of the towne; for
the plague, it seems, rages there more than ever, and so to my lodgings,
where my Lord had got a supper and the mistresse of the house, and
her daughters, and here staid Mrs. Pierce to speake with me about her
husband’s business, and I made her sup with us, and then at night my
Lord and I walked with her home, and so back again. My Lord and I ended
all we had to say as to his business overnight, and so I took leave, and
went again to Mr. Glanville’s and so to bed, it being very late.
