27th. Up and to the office, where sat till two o’clock, and then home
to dinner, whither by and by comes Mr. Creed, and he and I talked of our
Tangier business, and do find that there is nothing in the world done
with true integrity, but there is design along with it, as in my
Lord Rutherford, who designs to have the profit of victualling of the
garrison himself, and others to have the benefit of making the Mole, so
that I am almost discouraged from coming any more to the Committee, were
it not that it will possibly hereafter bring me to some acquaintance of
great men. Then to the office again, where very busy till past ten
at night, and so home to supper and to bed. I have news this day from
Cambridge that my brother hath had his bachelor’s cap put on; but that
which troubles me is, that he hath the pain of the stone, and makes
bloody water with great pain, it beginning just as mine did. I pray God
help him.
