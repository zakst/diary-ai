3rd. To the office all the morning, at noon to dinner, where Mr. Creed
dined with me, and Mr. Ashwell, with whom after dinner I discoursed
concerning his daughter coming to live with us. I find that his daughter
will be very fit, I think, as any for our turn, but the conditions I
know not what they will be, he leaving it wholly to her, which will be
agreed on a while hence when my wife sees her. After an hourâ€™s discourse
after dinner with them, I to my office again, and there about business
of the office till late, and then home to supper and to bed.
