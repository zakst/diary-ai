and of this there was L500,000 brought in upon its being called in. And
from very good arguments they find that there cannot be less of it
in Ireland and Scotland than L100,000; so that there is but L150,000
missing; and of that, suppose that there should be not above 650,000
still remaining, either melted down, hid, or lost, or hoarded up in
England, there will then be but L100,000 left to be thought to have been
transported. Now, if L750,000 in twelve years’ time lost but a L100,000
in danger of being transported, then within thirty-five years’ time
will have lost but L3,888,880 and odd pounds; and as there is L650,000
remaining after twelve years’ time in England, so after thirty-five
years’ time, which was within this two years, there ought in proportion
to have been resting L6,111,120 or thereabouts, beside King James’s and
Queen Elizabeth’s money. Now that most of this must be hid is evident,
as they reckon, because of the dearth of money immediately upon the
calling-in of the State’s money, which was L500,000 that came in; and
yet there was not any money to be had in this City, which they say to
their own observation and knowledge was so. And therefore, though I can
say nothing in it myself, I do not dispute it.
