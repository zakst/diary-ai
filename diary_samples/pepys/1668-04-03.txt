3rd. Up, and Captain Perryman come to me to tell me how Tatnell told him
that this day one How is to charge me before the Commissioners of
Prizes to the value of L8000 in prizes, which I was troubled to hear, so
fearful I am, though I know that there is not a penny to be laid to my
charge that I dare not own, or that I have not owned under my hand, but
upon recollection it signifies nothing to me, and so I value it not,
being sure that I can have nothing in the world to my hurt known from
the business. So to the office, where all the morning to despatch
business, and so home to dinner with my clerks, whose company is of
great pleasure to me for their good discourse in any thing of the navy
I have a mind to talk of. After dinner by water from the Tower to White
Hall, there to attend the Duke of York as usual, and particularly in a
fresh complaint the Commissioners of the Treasury do make to him, and
by and by to the Council this day of our having prepared certificates
on the Exchequer to the further sum of near L50,000, and soon as we had
done with the Duke of York we did attend the Council; and were there
called in, and did hear Mr. Sollicitor [General] make his Report to
the Council in the business; which he did in a most excellent manner of
words, but most cruelly severe against us, and so were some of the Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury, as men guilty of a practice with the
tradesmen, to the King’s prejudice. I was unwilling to enter into a
contest with them; but took advantage of two or three words last spoke,
and brought it to a short issue in good words, that if we had the King’s
order to hold our hands, we would, which did end the matter: and they
all resolved we should have it, and so it ended: and so we away; I vexed
that I did not speak more in a cause so fit to be spoke in, and
wherein we had so much advantage; but perhaps I might have provoked the
Sollicitor and the Commissioners of the Treasury, and therefore, since,
I am not sorry that I forbore. Thence my Lord Brouncker and I to the
Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw the latter part of “The
Master and the Man,” and thence by coach to Duck Lane, to look out for
Marsanne, in French, a man that has wrote well of musique, but it is not
to be had, but I have given order for its being sent for over, and I
did here buy Des Cartes his little treatise of musique, and so home, and
there to read a little, and eat a little, though I find that my having
so little taste do make me so far neglect eating that, unless company
invite, I do not love to spend time upon eating, and so bring emptiness
and the Cholique. So to bed. This day I hear that Prince Rupert and
Holmes do go to sea: and by this there is a seeming friendship and peace
among our great seamen; but the devil a bit is there any love among
them, or can be.
