16th. Up, and with my head and heart full of my business, I to my
office, and there all the morning, where among other things to my great
content Captain Taylor brought me L40, the greater part of which I shall
gain to myself after much care and pains out of his bill of freight,
as I have at large set down in my book of Memorandums. At noon to the
‘Change and there met with Mr. Wood by design, and got out of him to
my advantage a condition which I shall make good use of against Sir W.
Batten (vide my book of Memorandums touching the contract of masts of
Sir W. Warren about which I have had so much trouble). So home to dinner
and then to the Star Tavern hard by to our arbitration of Mr. Bland’s
business, and at it a great while, but I found no order like to be kept
in our inquiry, and Mr. Clerke, the other arbitrator, one so far from
being fit (though able as to his trade of a merchant) to inquire and
to take pains in searching out the truth on both sides, that we parted
without doing anything, nor do I believe we shall at all ever attain
to anything in it. Then home and till 12 at night making up my accounts
with great account of this day’s receipt of Captain Taylor’s money and
some money reimbursed me which I have laid out on Field’s business. So
home with my mind in pretty good quiet, and to Supper and to bed.
