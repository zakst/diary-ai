5th. Up, it being very cold and a great snow and frost tonight. To the
office, and there all the morning. At noon dined at home, troubled at
my wifeâ€™s being simply angry with Jane, our cook mayde (a good servant,
though perhaps hath faults and is cunning), and given her warning to
be gone. So to the office again, where we sat late, and then I to my
office, and there very late doing business. Home to supper and to the
office again, and then late home to bed.
