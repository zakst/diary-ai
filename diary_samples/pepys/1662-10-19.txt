19th. Up and by appointment with Mr. Lee, Wade, Evett, and workmen
to the Tower, and with the Lieutenant’s leave set them to work in the
garden, in the corner against the mayne-guard, a most unlikely place. It
being cold, Mr. Lee and I did sit all the day till three o’clock by the
fire in the Governor’s house; I reading a play of Fletcher’s, being “A
Wife for a Month,” wherein no great wit or language. Having done we went
to them at work, and having wrought below the bottom of the foundation
of the wall, I bid them give over, and so all our hopes ended; and so
went home, taking Mr. Leigh with me, and after drunk a cup of wine he
went away, and I to my office, there reading in Sir W. Petty’s book, and
so home and to bed, a little displeased with my wife, who, poor wretch,
is troubled with her lonely life, which I know not how without great
charge to help as yet, but I will study how to do it.
