25th. By the morning we were come close to the land, and every body
made ready to get on shore. The King and the two Dukes did eat their
breakfast before they went, and there being set some ship’s diet before
them, only to show them the manner of the ship’s diet, they eat of
nothing else but pease and pork, and boiled beef. I had Mr. Darcy in my
cabin and Dr. Clerke, who eat with me, told me how the King had given
L50 to Mr. Sheply for my Lord’s servants, and L500 among the officers
and common men of the ship. I spoke with the Duke of York about
business, who called me Pepys by name, and upon my desire did promise me
his future favour. Great expectation of the King’s making some Knights,
but there was none. About noon (though the brigantine that Beale made
was there ready to carry him) yet he would go in my Lord’s barge with
the two Dukes. Our Captain steered, and my Lord went along bare with
him. I went, and Mr. Mansell, and one of the King’s footmen, with a dog
that the King loved,

     [Charles II.’s love of dogs is well known, but it is not so well
     known that his dogs were continually being stolen from him.  In the
     “Mercurius Publicus,” June 28-July 5, 1660, is the following
     advertisement, apparently drawn up by the King himself: “We must
     call upon you again for a Black Dog between a greyhound and a
     spaniel, no white about him, onely a streak on his brest, and his
     tayl a little bobbed.  It is His Majesties own Dog, and doubtless
     was stoln, for the dog was not born nor bred in England, and would
     never forsake His master.  Whoesoever findes him may acquaint any at
     Whitehal for the Dog was better known at Court, than those who stole
     him.  Will they never leave robbing his Majesty!  Must he not keep a
     Dog?  This dog’s place (though better than some imagine) is the only
     place which nobody offers to beg.”  (Quoted in “Notes and Queries,”
