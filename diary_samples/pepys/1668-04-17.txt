of his voyage, and pleases me well, and I hope hath got something. This
morning paid the Royall Society L1 6s., and so to the office all the
morning. At noon home to dinner with my people, and there much pretty
discourse of Balty’s. So by coach to White Hall: the coachman on Ludgate
Hill ‘lighted, and beat a fellow with a sword, 2s. 6d. Did little
business with the Duke of York. Hear that the House is upon the business
of Harman, who, they say, takes all on himself. Thence, with Brouncker,
