8th. Up betimes and to the office, where all the morning sitting and
did discover three or four fresh instances of Sir W. Pen’s old cheating
dissembling tricks, he being as false a fellow as ever was born. Thence
with Sir. W. Batten and Lord Bruncker to the White Horse in Lumbard
Streete to dine with Captain Cocke, upon particular business of canvas
to buy for the King, and here by chance I saw the mistresse of the house
I have heard much of, and a very pretty woman she is indeed and her
husband the simplest looked fellow and old that ever I saw. After dinner
I took coach and away to Hales’s, where my wife is sitting; and, indeed,
her face and necke, which are now finished, do so please me that I am
not myself almost, nor was not all the night after in writing of my
letters, in consideration of the fine picture that I shall be master of.
Thence home and to the office, where very late, and so home to supper
and to bed.
