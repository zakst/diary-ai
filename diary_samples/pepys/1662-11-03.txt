3d. Up and with Sir J. Minnes in his coach to White Hall, to the Duke’s;
but found him gone out a-hunting. Thence to my Lord Sandwich, from whom
I receive every day more and more signs of his confidence and esteem
of me. Here I met with Pierce the chyrurgeon, who tells me that my Lady
Castlemaine is with child; but though it be the King’s, yet her Lord
being still in town, and sometimes seeing of her, though never to eat or
lie together, it will be laid to him. He tells me also how the Duke of
York is smitten in love with my Lady Chesterfield

     [Lady Elizabeth Butler, daughter of James Butler, first Duke of
     Ormond, second wife of Philip Stanhope, second Earl of Chesterfield.
     She died July, 1665 (see “Memoires de Grammont,” chap. viii.).
     Peter Cunningham thinks that this banishment was only temporary,
     for, according to the Grammont Memoirs, she was in town when the
     Russian ambassador was in London, December, 1662, and January, 1662-
