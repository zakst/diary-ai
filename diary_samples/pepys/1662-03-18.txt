18th. All the morning at the office with Sir W. Pen. Dined at home, and
Luellin and Blurton with me. After dinner to the office again, where Sir
G. Carteret and we staid awhile, and then Sir W. Pen and I on board some
of the ships now fitting for East Indys and Portugall, to see in what
forwardness they are, and so back home again, and I write to my father
by the post about Brampton Court, which is now coming on. But that
which troubles me is that my Father has now got an ague that I fear may
endanger his life. So to bed.
