16th. Up again betimes to attend the examination of Mr. Gawden’s,
accounts, where we all met, but I did little but fit myself for the
drawing my great letter to the Duke of York of the state of the Navy
for want of money. At noon to the ‘Change, and thence back to the new
taverne come by us; the Three Tuns, where D. Gawden did feast us all
with a chine of beef and other good things, and an infinite dish of
fowl, but all spoiled in the dressing. This noon I met with Mr. Hooke,
and he tells me the dog which was filled with another dog’s blood, at
the College the other day, is very well, and like to be so as ever, and
doubts not its being found of great use to men; and so do Dr. Whistler,
who dined with us at the taverne. Thence home in the evening, and I to
my preparing my letter, and did go a pretty way in it, staying late upon
it, and then home to supper and to bed, the weather being on a sudden
set in to be very cold.
