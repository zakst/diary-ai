20th. Up and to the office, where all the morning, and then towards the
‘Change, at noon, in my way observing my mistake yesterday in Mark Lane,
that the woman I saw was not the pretty woman I meant, the line-maker’s
wife, but a new-married woman, very pretty, a strong-water seller: and
in going by, to my content, I find that the very pretty daughter at the
Ship tavern, at the end of Billiter Lane, is there still, and in the
bar: and, I believe, is married to him that is new come, and hath new
trimmed the house. Home to dinner, and then to the office, we having
dispatched away Mr. Oviatt to Hull, about our prizes there; and I have
wrote a letter of thanks by him to Lord Bellasses, who had writ to me to
offer all his service for my interest there, but I dare not trust him.
In the evening late walking in the garden with my wife, and then to bed.
