16th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, then up and to my chamber and
my office, looking over some plates which I find necessary for me to
understand pretty well, because of the Dutch warr. Then home to dinner,
where Creed dined with us, and so after dinner he and I walked to the
Rolls’ Chappell, expecting to hear the great Stillingfleete preach, but
he did not; but a very sorry fellow, which vexed me. The sermon done,
we parted, and I home, where I find Mr. Andrews, and by and by comes
Captain Taylor, my old acquaintance at Westminster, that understands
musique very well and composes mighty bravely; he brought us some things
of two parts to sing, very hard; but that that is the worst, he is very
conceited of them, and that though they are good makes them troublesome
to one, to see him every note commend and admire them. He supped with
me, and a good understanding man he is and a good scholler, and, among
other things, a great antiquary, and among other things he can, as he
says, show the very originall Charter to Worcester, of King Edgar’s,
wherein he stiles himself, Rex Marium Brittanniae, &c.; which is the
great text that Mr. Selden and others do quote, but imperfectly and upon
trust. But he hath the very originall, which he says he will shew me. He
gone we to bed. This night I am told that newes is come of our taking of
three Dutch men-of-warr, with the loss of one of our Captains.
