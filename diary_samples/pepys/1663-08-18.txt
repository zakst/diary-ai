18th. Up and to my office, where we sat all the morning. And at noon
home, and my father came and dined with me, Susan being come and helped
my wife to dress dinner. After dinner my father and I talked about our
country-matters, and in fine I find that he thinks L50 per ann. will go
near to keep them all, which I am glad of. He having taken his leave of
me and my wife without any mention of the differences between them and
my wife in the country, I went forth to several places about businesses,
and so home again, and after prayers to bed.
