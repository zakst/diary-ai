body would wake. At last one rose and helped my wife, and so to sleep

the Lords Commissioners, and so directly home and dined with Sir W.
Batten and my Lady, and after dinner had much discourse tending to

very busy, and so till past 12 at night, and so home to bed. This day my
wife went to the burial of a little boy of W. Joyceâ€™s.
