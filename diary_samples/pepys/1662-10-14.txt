14th (Lord’s day). Lay with great content talking with my wife in
bed, and so up and to church and then home, and had a neat dinner by
ourselves, and after dinner walked to White Hall and my Lord’s, and up
and down till chappell time, and then to the King’s chappell, where I
heard the service, and so to my Lord’s, and there Mr. Howe and Pagett,
the counsellor, an old lover of musique. We sang some Psalms of Mr.
Lawes, and played some symphonys between till night, that I was sent for
to Mr. Creed’s lodging, and there was Captain Ferrers and his lady and
W. Howe and I; we supped very well and good sport in discourse. After
supper I was sent for to my Lord, with whom I staid talking about his,
and my owne, and the publique affairs, with great content, he advising
me as to my owne choosing of Sir R. Bernard for umpire in the businesses
between my uncle and us, that I would not trust to him upon his
direction, for he did not think him a man to be trusted at all; and so
bid him good night, and to Mr. Creed’s again; Mr. Moore, with whom I
intended to have lain, lying physically without sheets; and there, after
some discourse, to bed, and lay ill, though the bed good, my stomach
being sicke all night with my too heavy supper.
