14th. Up, and to work, having carpenters come to helpe in setting
up bedsteads and hangings; and at that trade my people and I all the
morning, till pressed by publique business to leave them against my will
in the afternoon: and yet I was troubled in being at home, to see all my
goods lie up and down the house in a bad condition, and strange workmen
going to and fro might take what they would almost. All the afternoon
busy; and Sir W. Coventry come to me, and found me, as God would have
it, in my office, and people about me setting my papers to rights; and
there discoursed about getting an account ready against the Parliament,
and thereby did create me infinite of business, and to be done on a
sudden; which troubled me: but, however, he being gone, I about it late,
and to good purpose. And so home, having this day also got my wine out
of the ground again, and set in my cellar; but with great pain to keep
the porters that carried it in from observing the money-chests there. So
to bed as last night, only my wife and I upon a bedstead with curtains
in that which was Mercerâ€™s chamber, and Balty and his wife (who are here
and do us good service), where we lay last night. This day, poor Tom
Pepys, the turner, was with me, and Kate, Joyce, to bespeake places; one
for himself, the other for her husband. She tells me he hath lost L140
per annum, but have seven houses left.
