14th (Lord’s day). At home, and Robert Barnwell with us, and dined, and
in the evening my father and I walked round Portholme and viewed all the
fields, which was very pleasant. Thence to Hinchingbroke, which is now
all in dirt, because of my Lord’s building, which will make it very
magnificent. Back to Brampton, and to supper and to bed.
