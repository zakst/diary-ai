8th. Though a bitter cold day, yet I rose, and though my pain and
tenderness in my testicle remains a little, yet I do verily think that
my pain yesterday was nothing else, and therefore I hope my disease of
the stone may not return to me, but void itself in pissing, which God
grant, but I will consult my physitian. This morning is brought me to
the office the sad newes of “The London,” in which Sir J. Lawson’s men
were all bringing her from Chatham to the Hope, and thence he was to
go to sea in her; but a little a’this side the buoy of the Nower,
she suddenly blew up. About 24 [men] and a woman that were in the
round-house and coach saved; the rest, being above 300, drowned: the
ship breaking all in pieces, with 80 pieces of brass ordnance. She lies
sunk, with her round-house above water. Sir J. Lawson hath a great loss
in this of so many good chosen men, and many relations among them. I
went to the ‘Change, where the news taken very much to heart. So home to
dinner, and Mr. Moore with me. Then I to Gresham College, and there saw
several pretty experiments, and so home and to my office, and at night
about I I home to supper and to bed.
