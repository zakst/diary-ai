12th (Lord’s day). Up and to church to St. Lawrence to hear Dr. Wilkins,
the great scholar, for curiosity, I having never heard him: but was not
satisfied with him at all, only a gentleman sat in the pew I by chance
sat in, that sang most excellently, and afterward I found by his face
that he had been a Paul’s scholler, but know not his name, and I was
also well pleased with the church, it being a very fine church. So home
to dinner, and then to my office all the afternoon doing of business,
and in the evening comes Mr. Hill (but no Andrews) and we spent the
evening very finely, singing, supping and discoursing. Then to prayers
and to bed.
