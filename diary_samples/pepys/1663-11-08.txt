8th (Lord’s day). Up, and it being late, to church without my wife, and
there I saw Pembleton come into the church and bring his wife with
him, a good comely plain woman, and by and by my wife came after me
all alone, which I was a little vexed at. I found that my coming in
a perriwigg did not prove so strange to the world as I was afear’d it
would, for I thought that all the church would presently have cast
their eyes all upon me, but I found no such thing. Here an ordinary lazy
sermon of Mr. Mill’s, and then home to dinner, and there Tom came and
dined with us; and after dinner to talk about a new black cloth suit
that I have a making, and so at church time to church again, where the
Scott preached, and I slept most of the time. Thence home, and I
spent most of the evening upon Fuller’s “Church History” and Barckly’s
“Argeny,” and so after supper to prayers and to bed, a little fearing
my pain coming back again, myself continuing as costive as ever, and my
physic ended, but I had sent a porter to-day for more and it was brought
me before I went to bed, and so with pretty good content to bed.
