June 1st (Lordâ€™s day). At church in the morning. A stranger made a very
good sermon. Dined at home, and Mr. Spong came to see me; so he and I
sat down a little to sing some French psalms, and then comes Mr. Shepley
and Mr. Moore, and so we to dinner, and after dinner to church again,
where a Presbyter made a sad and long sermon, which vexed me, and so
home, and so to walk on the leads, and supper and to prayers and bed.
