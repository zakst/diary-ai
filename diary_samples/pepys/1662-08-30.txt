30th. Up betimes among my workmen, and so to the office, where we sat
all the morning, and at noon rose and had news that Sir W. Pen would be
in town from Ireland, which I much wonder at, he giving so little notice
of it, and it troubled me exceedingly what to do for a lodging, and
more what to do with my goods, that are all in his house; but at last I
resolved to let them lie there till Monday, and so got Griffin to get
a lodging as near as he could, which is without a door of our back door
upon Tower Hill, a chamber where John Pavis, one of our clerks, do lie
in, but he do provide himself elsewhere, and I am to have his chamber.
So at the office all the afternoon and the evening till past to at night
expecting Sir W. Pen’s coming, but he not coming to-night I went thither
and there lay very well, and like my lodging well enough. My man Will
after he had got me to bed did go home and lay there, and my maid Jane
lay among my goods at Sir W. Pen’s.
