14th. Called up by break of day by Captain Cocke, by agreement, and he
and I in his coach through Kent-streete (a sad place through the
plague, people sitting sicke and with plaisters about them in the street
begging) to Viner’s and Colvill’s about money business, and so to my
house, and there I took L300 in order to the carrying it down to my
Lord Sandwich in part of the money I am to pay for Captain Cocke by our
agreement. So I took it down, and down I went to Greenwich to my office,
and there sat busy till noon, and so home to dinner, and thence to the
office again, and by and by to the Duke of Albemarle’s by water late,
where I find he had remembered that I had appointed to come to him this
day about money, which I excused not doing sooner; but I see, a dull
fellow, as he is, do sometimes remember what another thinks he mindeth
not. My business was about getting money of the East India Company; but,
Lord! to see how the Duke himself magnifies himself in what he had
done with the Company; and my Lord Craven what the King could have done
without my Lord Duke, and a deale of stir, but most mightily what a
brave fellow I am. Back by water, it raining hard, and so to the office,
and stopped my going, as I intended, to the buoy of the Nore, and great
reason I had to rejoice at it, for it proved the night of as great a
storme as was almost ever remembered. Late at the office, and so home to
bed. This day, calling at Mr. Rawlinson’s to know how all did there, I
hear that my pretty grocer’s wife, Mrs. Beversham, over the way there,
her husband is lately dead of the plague at Bow, which I am sorry for,
for fear of losing her neighbourhood.
