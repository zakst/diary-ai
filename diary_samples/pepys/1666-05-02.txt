2nd. Up and find the girle better, which we are glad of, and with Sir W.
Batten to White Hall by coach. There attended the Duke as usual. Thence
with Captain Cocke, whom I met there, to London, to my office, to
consult about serving him in getting him some money, he being already
tired of his slavery to my Lord Bruncker, and the charge it costs
him, and gets no manner of courtesy from him for it. He gone I home to
dinner, find the girle yet better, so no fear of being forced to send
her out of doors as we intended. After dinner. I by water to White Hall
to a Committee for Tangier upon Mr. Yeabsly’s business, which I got
referred to a Committee to examine. Thence among other stops went to my
ruler’s house, and there staid a great while with Nan idling away the
afternoon with pleasure. By and by home, so to my office a little, and
then home to supper with my wife, the girle being pretty well again, and
then to bed.
