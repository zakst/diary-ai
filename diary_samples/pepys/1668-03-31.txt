31st. Up pretty betimes and to the office, where we sat all the morning,
and at noon I home to dinner, where uncle Thomas dined with me, as he do
every quarter, and I paid him his pension; and also comes Mr. Hollier
a little fuddled, and so did talk nothing but Latin, and laugh, that it
was very good sport to see a sober man in such a humour, though he was
not drunk to scandal. At dinner comes a summons for this office and the
Victualler to attend a Committee of Parliament this afternoon, with
Sir D. Gawden, which I accordingly did, with my papers relating to
the sending of victuals to Sir John Harman’s fleete; and there, Sir R.
Brookes in the chair, we did give them a full account, but, Lord! to see
how full they are and immoveable in their jealousy that some means are
used to keep Harman from coming home, for they have an implacable desire
to know the bottom of the not improving the first victory, and would lay
it upon Brouncker. Having given them good satisfaction I away thence,
up and down, wanting a little to see whether I could get Mrs. Burroughes
out, but elle being in the shop ego did speak con her much, she could
not then go far, and so I took coach and away to Unthanke’s, and there
took up my wife and Deb., and to the Park, where, being in a hackney,
and they undressed, was ashamed to go into the tour, but went round
the park, and so with pleasure home, where Mr. Pelting come and sat and
talked late with us, and he being gone, I called Deb. to take pen, ink,
and paper and write down what things come into my head for my wife to
do in order to her going into the country, and the girl, writing not
so well as she would do, cried, and her mistress construed it to
be sullenness, and so away angry with her too, but going to bed she
undressed me, and there I did give her good advice and baiser la, elle
weeping still.
