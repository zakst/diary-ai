28th. A very hard frost; which is news to us after having none almost
these three years. Up and to Ironmongers’ Hall by ten o’clock to the
funeral of Sir Richard Stayner. Here we were, all the officers of the
Navy, and my Lord Sandwich, who did discourse with us about the fishery,
telling us of his Majesty’s resolution to give L200 to every man that
will set out a Busse;

     [A small sea-vessel used in the Dutch herring-fishery.]

and advising about the effects of this encouragement, which will be a
very great matter certainly. Here we had good rings, and by and by
were to take coach; and I being got in with Mr. Creed into a four-horse
coach, which they come and told us were only for the mourners, I
went out, and so took this occasion to go home. Where I staid all day
expecting Gosnell’s coming, but there came an excuse from her that she
had not heard yet from her mother, but that she will come next week,
which I wish she may, since I must keep one that I may have some
pleasure therein. So to my office till late writing out a copy of my
uncle’s will, and so home and to bed.
