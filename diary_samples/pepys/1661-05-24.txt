24th. At home all the morning making up my private accounts, and this is
the first time that I do find myself to be clearly worth L500 in money,
besides all my goods in my house, &c. In the afternoon at the office
late, and then I went to the Wardrobe, where I found my Lord at supper,
and therefore I walked a good while till he had done, and I went in to
him, and there he looked over my accounts. And they were committed
to Mr. Moore to see me paid what remained due to me. Then down to the
kitchen to eat a bit of bread and butter, which I did, and there I took
one of the maids by the chin, thinking her to be Susan, but it proved to
be her sister, who is very like her. From thence home.
