9th. At the office all the morning private with Sir G. Carteret (who
I expected something from about yesterday’s business, but he said
nothing), Sir W. Batten, and Sir W. Pen, about drawing; up an answer
to several demands of my Lord Treasurer, and late at it till 2 o’clock.
Then to dinner, and my wife to Sir W. Pen’s, and so to the office again
and sat till late; and so home, where I found Mr. Armiger below talking
with my wife, but being offended with him for his leaving of my brother
Tom I shewed him no countenance, but did take notice of it to him
plainly, and I perceive he was troubled at it, but I am glad I told him
of it. Then (when he was gone) up to write several letters by the post,
and so to set my papers and things in order, and to bed. This morning
we agreed upon some things to answer to the Duke about the practice
of striking of the flags, which will now put me upon finishing my
resolution of writing something upon the subject.
