8 oâ€™clock at night, as far almost as Bow, and so back again, and so home
to supper and to bed. This day I did bid Balty to agree with the Dutch
paynter, which he once led me to, to see landskipps, for a winter piece
of snow, which indeed is a good piece, and costs me but 40s., which I
would not take the money again for, it being, I think, very good. After
a little supper to bed, being in less pain still, and had very good
rest.
