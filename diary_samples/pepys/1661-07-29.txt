29th. This morning we began again to sit in the mornings at the office,
but before we sat down. Sir R. Slingsby and I went to Sir R. Fordâ€™s to
see his house, and we find it will be very convenient for us to have it
added to the office if he can be got to part with it. Then we sat down
and did business in the office. So home to dinner, and my brother Tom
dined with me, and after dinner he and I alone in my chamber had a
great deal of talk, and I find that unless my father can forbear to make
profit of his house in London and leave it to Tom, he has no mind to
set up the trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.
After this I went with him to my mother, and there told her how things
do fall out short of our expectations, which I did (though it be true)
to make her leave off her spending, which I find she is nowadays very
free in, building upon what is left to us by my uncle to bear her out
in it, which troubles me much. While I was here word is brought that my
aunt Fenner is exceeding ill, and that my mother is sent for presently
to come to her: also that my cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very
ill himself, is this day gone to the country to his brother, John
Glassecocke, who is a-dying there. Home.
