15th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where I heard a German preach, in
a tone hard to be understood, but yet an extraordinary good sermon, and
wholly to my great content. So home, and there all alone with wife and
girle to dinner, and then I busy at my chamber all the afternoon, and
looking over my plate, which indeed is a very fine quantity, God knows,
more than ever I expected to see of my own, and more than is fit for a
man of no better quality than I am. In the evening comes Mrs. Turner to
visit us, who hath been long sick, and she sat and supped with us, and
after supper, her son Francke being there, now upon the point of his
going to the East Indys, I did give him “Lex Mercatoria,” and my wife my
old pair of tweezers, which are pretty, and my book an excellent one for
him. Most of our talk was of the great discourse the world hath against
my Lady Batten, for getting her husband to give her all, and disinherit
his eldest son; though the truth is, the son, as they say, did play
the knave with his father when time was, and the father no great matter
better with him, nor with other people also. So she gone, we to bed.
