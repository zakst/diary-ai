December 1st (Lord’s day). In the morning at church and heard Mr. Mills.
At home dined and with me by appointment Mr. Sanchy, who should have
brought his mistress, Mrs. Mary Archer, of Cambridge, but she could not
come, but we had a good dinner for him. And so in the afternoon my wife
went to church, and he and I stayed at home and drank and talked, and
he stayed with me till night and supped with me, when I expected to have
seen Jack Cole and Lem. Wagstaffe, but they did not come. We this day
cut a brave collar of brawn from Winchcombe which proves very good, and
also opened the glass of girkins which Captain Cocke did give my wife
the other day, which are rare things. So at night to bed. There hath
lately been great clapping up of some old statesmen, such as Ireton,
Moyer, and others, and they say, upon a great plot, but I believe no
such thing; but it is but justice that they should be served as they
served the poor Cavaliers; and I believe it will oftentimes be so as
long as I live, whether there be cause or no. This evening my brother
Tom was with me, and I did talk again to him about Mr. Townsend’s
daughter, and I do intend to put the business in hand. I pray God give a
good end to it.
