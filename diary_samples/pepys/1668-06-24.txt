24th. Up, and Creed and Colonell Atkins come to me about sending coals
to Tangier: and upon that most of the morning. Thence Creed and I to
Alderman Backewell’s about Tangier business of money, and thence I
by water (calling and drinking, but not baisado, at Michell’s) to
Westminster, but it being holyday did no business, only to Martin’s...
and so home again by water, and busy till dinner, and then with wife,
Mercer, Deb., and W. Hewer to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there
saw “The Impertinents,” a pretty good play; and so by water to Spring
Garden, and there supped, and so home, not very merry, only when we come
home, Mercer and I sat and sung in the garden a good while, and so to
bed.
