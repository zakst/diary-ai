16th, 17th, 18th, 19th. These four days we spent in putting things in
order, letting of the crop upon the ground, agreeing with Stankes to
have a care of our business in our absence, and we think ourselves in
nothing happy but in lighting upon him to be our bayly; in riding to
Offord and Sturtlow, and up and down all our lands, and in the evening
walking, my father and I about the fields talking, and had advice from
Mr. Moore from London, by my desire, that the three witnesses of the
will being all legatees, will not do the will any wrong. To-night
Serjeant Bernard, I hear, is come home into the country. To supper and
to bed. My aunt continuing in her base, hypocritical tricks, which both
Jane Perkin (of whom we make great use), and the maid do tell us every
day of.
