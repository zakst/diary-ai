24th (Midsummer day). Up early and to my office, putting things in order
against we sit. There came to me my cozen Harry Alcocke, whom I much
respect, to desire (by a letter from my father to me, where he had been
some days) my help for him to some place. I proposed the sea to him, and
I think he will take it, and I hope do well. Sat all the morning, and I
bless God I find that by my diligence of late and still, I do get ground
in the office every day. At noon to the Change, where I begin to be
known also, and so home to dinner, and then to the office all the
afternoon dispatching business. At night news is brought me that
Field the rogue hath this day cast me at Guildhall in L30 for his
imprisonment, to which I signed his commitment with the rest of the
officers; but they having been parliament-men, that he hath begun the
law with me; and threatens more, but I hope the Duke of York will bear
me out. At night home, and Mr. Spong came to me, and so he and I sat
singing upon the leads till almost ten at night and so he went away
(a pretty, harmless, and ingenious man), and I to bed, in a very great
content of mind, which I hope by my care still in my business will
continue to me.
