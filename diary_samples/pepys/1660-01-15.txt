15th. All the morning at the Commissioners of the Navy about getting
out my bill for L650 for the last quarter, which I got done with a great
deal of ease, which is not common. After that with Mr. Turner to the
Dolphin and drunk, and so by water to W. Symons, where D. Scobell with
his wife, a pretty and rich woman. Mrs. Symons, a very fine woman, very
merry after dinner with marrying of Luellin and D. Scobell’s kinswoman
that was there. Then to my Lord who told me how the King has given him
the place of the great Wardrobe. My Lord resolves to have Sarah again. I
to my father’s, and then to see my uncle and aunt Fenner. So home and to
bed.
