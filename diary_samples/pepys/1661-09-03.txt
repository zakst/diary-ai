3rd. This day some of us Commissioners went down to Deptford to pay
off some ships, but I could not go, but staid at home all the morning
setting papers to rights, and this morning Mr. Howell, our turner, sent
me two things to file papers on very handsome. Dined at home, and then
with my wife to the Wardrobe, where my Lady’s child was christened (my
Lord Crew and his Lady, and my Lady Montagu, my Lord’s mother-in-law,
were the witnesses), and named Katherine

     [Lady Katherine Montagu, youngest daughter of Lord Sandwich,
     married, first, Nicholas Bacon, eldest son and heir of Sir Nicholas
     Bacon, K.B., of Shrubland Hall, co.  Suffolk; and, secondly, the
     Rev. Balthazar Gardeman.  She died January 15th, 1757, at ninety-six
     years, four months.--B.]

(the Queen elect’s name); but to my and all our trouble, the Parson of
the parish christened her, and did not sign the child with the sign of
the cross. After that was done, we had a very fine banquet, the best I
ever was at, and so (there being very little company) we by and by broke
up, and my wife and I to my mother, who I took a liberty to advise about
her getting things ready to go this week into the country to my father,
and she (being become now-a-days very simple) took it very ill, and we
had a great deal of noise and wrangling about it. So home by coach.
