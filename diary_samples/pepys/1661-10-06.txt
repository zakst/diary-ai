6th (Lord’s day). To church in the morning; Mr. Mills preached, who,
I expect, should take in snuffe [anger] that my wife not come to his
child’s christening the other day. The winter coming on, many of parish
ladies are come home and appear at church again; among others, the three
sisters the Thornbury’s, a very fine, and the most zealous people that
ever I saw in my life, even to admiration, if it were true zeal. There
was also my pretty black girl, Mrs. Dekins, and Mrs. Margaret Pen, this
day come to church in a new flowered satin suit that my wife helped to
buy her the other day. So me to dinner, and to church in the afternoon
to St. Gregory’s, by Paul’s, where I saw Mr. Moose in the gallery and
went up to him and heard a good sermon of Dr. Buck’s, one I never
heard before, a very able man. So home, and in the evening I went to
my Valentine, her father and mother being out of town, to fetch her to
supper to my house, and then came Sir W. Pen and would have her to his,
so with much sport I got them all to mine, and we were merry, and so
broke up and to bed.
