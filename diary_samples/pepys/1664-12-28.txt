28th. I waked in the morning about 6 o’clock and my wife not come to
bed; I lacked a pot, but there was none, and bitter cold, so was forced
to rise and piss in the chimney, and to bed again. Slept a little
longer, and then hear my people coming up, and so I rose, and my wife
to bed at eight o’clock in the morning, which vexed me a little, but I
believe there was no hurt in it all, but only mirthe, therefore took no
notice. I abroad with Sir W. Batten to the Council Chamber, where all of
us to discourse about the way of measuring ships and the freight fit to
give for them by the tun, where it was strange methought to hear so
poor discourses among the Lords themselves, and most of all to see how
a little empty matter delivered gravely by Sir W. Pen was taken mighty
well, though nothing in the earth to the purpose. But clothes, I
perceive more and more every day, is a great matter. Thence home with
Sir W. Batten by coach, and I home to dinner, finding my wife still
in bed. After dinner abroad, and among other things visited my Lady
Sandwich, and was there, with her and the young ladies, playing at cards
till night. Then home and to my office late, then home to bed, leaving
my wife and people up to more sports, but without any great satisfaction
to myself therein.
