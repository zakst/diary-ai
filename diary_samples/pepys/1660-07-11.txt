11th. With Sir W. Pen by water to the Navy office, where we met, and
dispatched business. And that being done, we went all to dinner to the
Dolphin, upon Major Brown’s invitation. After that to the office again,
where I was vexed, and so was Commissioner Pett, to see a busy fellow
come to look out the best lodgings for my Lord Barkley, and the
combining between him and Sir W. Pen; and, indeed, was troubled much
at it. Home to White Hall, and took out my bill signed by the King, and
carried it to Mr. Watkins of the Privy Seal to be despatched there, and
going home to take a cap, I borrowed a pair of sheets of Mr. Howe, and
by coach went to the Navy office, and lay (Mr. Hater, my clerk, with me)
at Commissioner Willoughby’s’ house, where I was received by him very
civilly and slept well.
