9th. Up, and at the office all the morning. In the afternoon by coach
with Sir J. Minnes to White Hall, and there to a Committee for Fishing;
but the first thing was swearing to be true to the Company, and we
were all sworne; but a great dispute we had, which, methought, is very
ominous to the Company; some, that we should swear to be true to the
best of our power, and others to the best of our understanding; and
carried in the last, though in that we are the least able to serve the
Company, because we would not be obliged to attend the business when we
can, but when we list. This consideration did displease me, but it was
voted and so went. We did nothing else, but broke up till a Committee
of Guinny was set and ended, and then met again for Tangier, and there
I did my business about my Lord Peterboroughâ€™s order and my own for my
expenses for the garrison lately. So home, by the way calling for my
Chaucer and other books, and that is well done to my mind, which pleased
me well. So to my office till late writing letters, and so home to my
wife to supper and bed, where we have not lain together because of the
heat of the weather a good while, but now against her going into the
country.
