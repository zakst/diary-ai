24th. This morning came my cozen Thos. Pepys the Executor, to speak with
me, and I had much talk with him both about matters of money which my
Lord Sandwich has of his and I am bond for, as also of my uncle Thomas,
who I hear by him do stand upon very high terms. Thence to my painter’s,
and there I saw our pictures in the frames, which please me well. Thence
to the Wardrobe, where very merry with my Lady, and after dinner I
seat for the pictures thither, and mine is well liked; but she is much
offended with my wife’s, and I am of her opinion, that it do much wrong
her; but I will have it altered. So home, in my way calling at Pope’s
Head alley, and there bought me a pair of scissars and a brass square.
So home and to my study and to bed.
