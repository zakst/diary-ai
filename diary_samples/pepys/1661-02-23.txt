23rd. To Westminster with my wife (she to her father’s), and about 10
o’clock back again home, and there I to the office a little, and thence
by coach with Commissioner Pett to Cheapside to one Savill, a painter,
who I intend shall do my picture and my wife’s. Thence I to dinner at
the Wardrobe, and so home to the office, and there all the afternoon
till night, and then both Sir Williams to my house, and in comes
Captain Cock, and they to cards. By and by Sir W. Batten and Cock, after
drinking a good deal of wine, went away, and Sir W. Pen staid with my
wife and I to supper, very pleasant, and so good night. This day I have
a chine of beef sent home, which I bespoke to send, and did send it as a
present to my uncle Wight.
