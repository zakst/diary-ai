4th. Waked in the morning at four o’clock to give some money to Mr.
Hetly, who was to go to London with the letters that I wrote yesterday
night. After he was gone I went and lay down in my gown upon my bed
again an hour or two. At last waked by a messenger come for a Post
Warrant for Mr. Hetly and Mr. Creed, who stood to give so little for
their horses that the men would not let them have any without a warrant,
which I sent them. All the morning getting Captain Holland’s commission
done, which I did, and he at noon went away. I took my leave of him upon
the quarter-deck with a bottle of sack, my Lord being just set down to
dinner. Then he being gone I went to dinner and after dinner to my cabin
to write. This afternoon I showed my Lord my accounts, which he passed,
and so I think myself to be worth near L100 now. In the evening I made
an order for Captain Sparling of the Assistance to go to Middleburgh, to
fetch over some of the King’s goods. I took the opportunity to send all
my Dutch money, 70 ducatoons and 29 gold ducats to be changed, if he
can, for English money, which is the first venture that ever I made, and
so I have been since a little afeard of it. After supper some music
and so to bed. This morning the King’s Proclamation against drinking,
swearing, and debauchery, was read to our ships’ companies in the fleet,
and indeed it gives great satisfaction to all.

     [The King’s “Proclamation against vicious, debauched, and prophane
     Persons” is dated May 30th.  It is printed in “Somers’s Tracts,” ed.
