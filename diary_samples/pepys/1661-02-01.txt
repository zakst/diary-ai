February 1st (Friday). A full office all this morning, and busy about
answering the Commissioners of Parliament to their letter, wherein they
desire to borrow two clerks of ours, which we will not grant them. After
dinner into London and bought some books, and a belt, and had my sword
new furbished. To the alehouse with Mr. Brigden and W. Symons. At night
home. So after a little music to bed, leaving my people up getting
things ready against to-morrowâ€™s dinner.
