30th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where I have not been a good
while: and there the church infinitely thronged with strangers since the
fire come into our parish; but not one handsome face in all of them, as
if, indeed, there was a curse, as Bishop Fuller heretofore said, upon
our parish. Here I saw Mercer come into the church, which I had a mind
to, but she avoided looking up, which vexed me. A pretty good sermon,
and then home, and comes Balty and dined with us. A good dinner; and
then to have my haire cut against winter close to my head, and then to
church again. A sorry sermon, and away home. [Sir] W. Pen and I to walk
to talk about several businesses, and then home; and my wife and I to
read in Fuller’s Church History, and so to supper and to bed. This month
ends with my mind full of business and concernment how this office
will speed with the Parliament, which begins to be mighty severe in the
examining our accounts, and the expence of the Navy this war.
