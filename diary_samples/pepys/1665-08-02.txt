2nd. Up, it being a publique fast, as being the first Wednesday of
the month, for the plague; I within doors all day, and upon my monthly
accounts late, and there to my great joy settled almost all my private
matters of money in my books clearly, and allowing myself several sums
which I had hitherto not reckoned myself sure of, because I would not
be over sure of any thing, though with reason I might do it, I did find
myself really worth L1900, for which the great God of Heaven and Earth
be praised! At night to the office to write a few letters, and so home
to bed, after fitting myself for tomorrowâ€™s journey.
