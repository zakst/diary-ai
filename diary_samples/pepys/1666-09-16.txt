16th (Lord’s day). Lay with much pleasure in bed talking with my wife
about Mr. Hater’s lying here and W. Hewer also, if Mrs. Mercer leaves
her house. To the office, whither also all my people about this account,
and there busy all the morning. At noon, with my wife, against her
will, all undressed and dirty, dined at Sir W. Pen’s, where was all the
company of our families in towne; but, Lord! so sorry a dinner: venison
baked in pans, that the dinner I have had for his lady alone hath
been worth four of it. Thence, after dinner, displeased with our
entertainment, to my office again, and there till almost midnight and
my people with me, and then home, my head mightily akeing about our
accounts.
