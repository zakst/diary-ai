10th. Up and to my office all the morning, and great pleasure it is to
be doing my business betimes. About noon Sir J. Minnes came to me and
staid half an hour with me in my office talking about his business with
Sir W. Pen, and (though with me an old doter) yet he told me freely how
sensible he is of Sir W. Pen’s treachery in this business, and what poor
ways he has taken all along to ingratiate himself by making Mr. Turner
write out things for him and then he gives them to the Duke, and how
he directed him to give Mr. Coventry L100 for his place, but that Mr.
Coventry did give him L20 back again. All this I am pleased to hear that
his knavery is found out. Dined upon a poor Lenten dinner at home, my
wife being vexed at a fray this morning with my Lady Batten about my
boy’s going thither to turn the watercock with their maydes’ leave, but
my Lady was mighty high upon it and she would teach his mistress better
manners, which my wife answered aloud that she might hear, that she
could learn little manners of her. After dinner to my office, and there
we sat all the afternoon till 8 at night, and so wrote my letters by
the post and so before 9 home, which is rare with me of late, I staying
longer, but with multitude of business my head akes, and so I can stay
no longer, but home to supper and to bed.
