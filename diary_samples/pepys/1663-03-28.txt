28th. Up betimes and to my office, where all the morning. Dined at home
and Creed with me, and though a very cold day and high wind, yet I
took him by land to Deptford, my common walk, where I did some little
businesses, and so home again walking both forwards and backwards, as
much along the street as we could to save going by water. So home, and
after being a little while hearing Ashwell play on the tryangle, to
my office, and there late, writing a chiding letter--to my poor father
about his being so unwilling to come to an account with me, which I
desire he might do, that I may know what he spends, and how to order the
estate so as to pay debts and legacys as far as may be. So late home to
supper and to bed.
