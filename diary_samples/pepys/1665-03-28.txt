28th. Up betimes and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I
did most of the business there, God wot. Then to the ‘Change, and thence
to the Coffee-house with Sir W. Warren, where much good discourse for us
both till 9 o’clock with great pleasure and content, and then parted
and I home to dinner, having eat nothing, and so to my office. At night
supped with my wife at Sir W. Pen’s, who is to go back for good and all
to the fleete to-morrow. Took leave and to my office, where till 12 at
night, and then home to bed.
