places about business, among others to the geometrical instrument
makers, and through Bedlam (calling by the way at an old bookseller’s
and there fell into looking over Spanish books and pitched upon some,
till I thought of my oathe when I was going to agree for them, and so
with much ado got myself out of the shop glad at my heart and so away)

commodities for my information in the prices we give in the Navy. So to
the Coffee [house] where extraordinary good discourse of Dr. Whistler’s’
