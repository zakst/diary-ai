29th. By a letter from the Duke complaining of the delay of the ships
that are to be got ready, Sir Williams both and I went to Deptford and
there examined into the delays, and were satisfyed. So back again home
and staid till the afternoon, and then I walked to the Bell at the
Maypole in the Strand, and thither came to me by appointment Mr.
Chetwind, Gregory, and Hartlibb, so many of our old club, and Mr. Kipps,
where we staid and drank and talked with much pleasure till it was late,
and so I walked home and to bed. Mr. Chetwind by chewing of tobacco
is become very fat and sallow, whereas he was consumptive, and in our
discourse he fell commending of “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” as
the best book, and the only one that made him a Christian, which puts me
upon the buying of it, which I will do shortly.
