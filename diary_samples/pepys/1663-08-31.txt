31st. Up and to my office all the morning, where Sir W. Batten and Sir
J. Minnes did pay the short allowance money to the East India companies,
and by the assistance of the City Marshall and his men, did lay hold of
two or three of the chief of the companies that were in the mutiny the
other day, and sent them to prison. This noon came Jane Gentleman to
serve my wife as her chamber mayde. I wish she may prove well. So ends
this month, with my mind pretty well in quiett, and in good disposition
of health since my drinking at home of a little wine with my beer; but
no where else do I drink any wine at all. The King and Queen and the
Court at the Bath, my Lord Sandwich in the country newly gone.
