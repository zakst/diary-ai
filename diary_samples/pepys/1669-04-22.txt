22nd. Up, and to the Office, where all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, and Captain Deane with us; and very good discourse, and
particularly about my getting a book for him to draw up his whole theory
of shipping, which, at my desire, he hath gone far in, and hath shewn
me what he hath done therein, to admiration. I did give him a
Parallelogram, which he is mightily taken with; and so after dinner
to the Office, where all the afternoon till night late, and then home.
Vexed at my wifeâ€™s not being come home, she being gone again abroad with
M. Batelier, and come not home till ten at night, which vexed me, so
that I to bed, and lay in pain awake till past one, and then to sleep.
