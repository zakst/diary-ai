8 at night, and so home again, there being a little pretty witty child
that is kept in their house that would not let us go without her, and
so fell a-crying by the water-side. So home, where I met Jack Cole, who
staid with me a good while, and is still of the old good humour that we
were of at school together, and I am very glad to see him. He gone, I
went to bed.
