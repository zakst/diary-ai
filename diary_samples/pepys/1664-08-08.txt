8th. Up and abroad with Sir W. Batten, by coach to St. James’s, where
by the way he did tell me how Sir J. Minnes would many times arrogate
to himself the doing of that that all the Board have equal share in,
and more that to himself which he hath had nothing to do in, and
particularly the late paper given in by him to the Duke, the translation
of a Dutch print concerning the quarrel between us and them, which he
did give as his own when it was Sir Richard Ford’s wholly. Also he told
me how Sir W. Pen (it falling in our discourse touching Mrs. Falconer)
was at first very great for Mr. Coventry to bring him in guests, and
that at high rates for places, and very open was he to me therein. After
business done with the Duke, I home to the Coffee-house, and so home to
dinner, and after dinner to hang up my fine pictures in my dining room,
which makes it very pretty, and so my wife and I abroad to the King’s
play-house, she giving me her time of the last month, she having not
seen any then; so my vowe is not broke at all, it costing me no more
money than it would have done upon her, had she gone both her times that
were due to her. Here we saw “Flora’s Figarys.” I never saw it before,
and by the most ingenuous performance of the young jade Flora, it seemed
as pretty a pleasant play as ever I saw in my life. So home to supper,
and then to my office late, Mr. Andrews and I to talk about our
victualling commission, and then he being gone I to set down my four
days past journalls and expenses, and so home to bed.
