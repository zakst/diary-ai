15th. With the two Sir Williams to the Trinity-house; and there in
their society had the business debated of Sir Nicholas Crisp’s sasse
at Deptford. Then to dinner, and after dinner I was sworn a Younger
Brother; Sir W. Rider being Deputy Master for my Lord of Sandwich; and
after I was sworn, all the Elder Brothers shake me by the hand: it is
their custom, it seems. Hence to the office, and so to Sir Wm. Batten’s
all three, and there we staid till late talking together in complaint
of the Treasurer’s instruments. Above all Mr. Waith, at whose child’s
christening our wives and we should have been to-day, but none of them
went and I am glad of it, for he is a very rogue, So home, and drew up
our report for Sir N. Crispe’s sasse, and so to bed. No news yet of our
fleet gone to Tangier, which we now begin to think long.
