3rd. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon by
invitation to dinner to Sir W. Penâ€™s, where my Lord Bruncker, Sir W.
Batten, and his lady, myself, and wife, Sir J. Minnes, and Mr. Turner
and his wife. Indifferent merry, to which I contributed the most, but
a mean dinner, and in a mean manner. In the evening a little to the
office, and then to them, where I found them at cards, myself very ill
with a cold (the frost continuing hard), so eat but little at supper,
but very merry, and late home to bed, not much pleased with the manner
of our entertainment, though to myself more civil than to any. This day,
I hear, hath been a conference between the two Houses about the Bill
for examining Accounts, wherein the House of Lords their proceedings in
petitioning the King for doing it by Commission is, in great heat,
voted by the Commons, after the conference, unparliamentary. The issue
whereof, God knows.
