8th. I rose and went to Westminster Hall, and there walked up and down
upon several businesses, and among others I met with Sir W. Pen, who
told me that he had this morning heard Sir G. Carteret extremely angry
against my man Will that he is every other day with the Commissioners of
Parliament at Westminster, and that his uncle was a rogue, and that
he did tell his uncle every thing that passes at the office, and Sir
William, though he loves the lad, did advise me to part with him, which
did with this surprise mightily trouble me, though I was already angry
with him, and so to the Wardrobe by water, and all the way did examine
Will about the business, but did not tell him upon what score, but I
find that the poor lad do suspect something. To dinner with my Lady, and
after dinner talked long with her, and so home, and to Sir W. Batten’s,
and sat and talked with him, and so home troubled in mind, and so up to
my study and read the two treaties before Mr. Selden’s “Mare Clausum,”
 and so to bed. This night come about L100 from Brampton by carrier to
me, in holsters from my father, which made me laugh.
