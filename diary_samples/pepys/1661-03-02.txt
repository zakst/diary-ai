2d. Early with Mr. Moore about Sir Paul Neale’s’ business with my uncle
and other things all the morning. Dined with him at Mr. Crew’s, and
after dinner I went to the Theatre, where I found so few people (which
is strange, and the reason I did not know) that I went out again, and so
to Salsbury Court, where the house as full as could be; and it seems
it was a new play, “The Queen’s Maske,” wherein there are some good
humours: among others, a good jeer to the old story of the Siege of
Troy, making it to be a common country tale. But above all it was
strange to see so little a boy as that was to act Cupid, which is one of
the greatest parts in it. Then home and to bed.
