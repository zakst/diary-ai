20th. Up and had L100 brought me by Prior of Brampton in full of his
purchase money for Barton’s house and some land. So to the office, and
thence with Mr. Coventry in his coach to St. James’s, with great content
and pride to see him treat me so friendly; and dined with him, and so
to White Hall together; where we met upon the Tangier Commission, and
discoursed many things thereon; but little will be done before my Lord
Rutherford comes there, as to the fortification or Mole. That done, my
Lord Sandwich and I walked together a good while in the Matted Gallery,
he acquainting me with his late enquiries into the Wardrobe business to
his content; and tells me how things stand. And that the first year was
worth about L3000 to him, and the next about as much; so that at this
day, if he were paid, it will be worth about L7000 to him. But it
contents me above all things to see him trust me as his confidant: so
I bid him good night, he being to go into the country, to keep his
Christmas, on Monday next. So by coach home and to my office, being post
night, and then home and to bed.
