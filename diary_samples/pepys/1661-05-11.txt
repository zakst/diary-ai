11th. This morning I went by water with Payne (Mr. Moore being with me)
to my Lord Chamberlain at Whitehall, and there spoke with my Lord, and
he did accept of Payne for his waterman, as I had lately endeavoured
to get him to be. After that Mr. Cooling did give Payne an order to
be entertained, and so I left him and Mr. Moore, and I went to Graye’s
Inne, and there to a barber’s, where I was trimmed, and had my haire
cut, in which I am lately become a little curious, finding that the
length of it do become me very much. So, calling at my father’s, I went
home, and there staid and saw my workmen follow their work, which this
night is brought to a very good condition. This afternoon Mr. Shepley,
Moore, and Creed came to me all about their several accounts with me,
and we did something with them all, and so they went away. This evening
Mr. Hater brought my last quarter’s salary, of which I was very glad,
because I have lost my first bill for it, and so this morning was forced
to get another signed by three of my fellow officers for it. All this
evening till late setting my accounts and papers in order, and so to
bed.
