26th. Up to the office, where we sat, and I had some high words with Sir
W. Batten about canvas, wherein I opposed him and all his experience,
about seams in the middle, and the profit of having many breadths and
narrow, which I opposed to good purpose, to the rejecting of the whole
business. At noon home to dinner, and thence took my wife by coach, and
she to my Lady Sandwich to see her. I to Tom Trice, to discourse about
my father’s giving over his administration to my brother, and thence to
Sir R. Bernard, and there received L19 in money, and took up my father’s
bond of L21, that is L40, in part of Piggot’s L209 due to us, which
L40 he pays for 7 roods of meadow in Portholme. Thence to my wife, and
carried her to the Old Bayly, and there we were led to the Quest House,
by the church, where all the kindred were by themselves at the buriall
of my uncle Fenner; but, Lord! what a pitiful rout of people there was
of them, but very good service and great company the whole was. And so
anon to church, and a good sermon, and so home, having for ease put
my L19 into W. Joyce’s hand, where I left it. So to supper and to bed,
being in a little pain from some cold got last night lying without
anything upon my feet.
