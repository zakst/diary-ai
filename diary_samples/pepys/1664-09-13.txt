13th. Up and, to the office, where sat busy all morning, dined at home
and after dinner to Fishmonger’s Hall, where we met the first time upon
the Fishery Committee, and many good things discoursed of concerning

     proposed by the Commissioners for the Royal Fishing to, Sir Ant.
     Desmarces & Co.  in reference to the regulation of lotteries; which
     are very unreasonable, and of the objections thereto” (“Calendar of
     State Papers,” Domestic, 1663-64, p.  576.)]

So home again and to my office, where after doing business home and to a
little musique, after supper, and so to bed.
