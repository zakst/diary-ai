15th. Lay long in bed, and by and by called up by Sir H. Cholmly,
who tells me that my Lord Middleton is for certain chosen Governor of
Tangier; a man of moderate understanding, not covetous, but a soldier of
fortune, and poor. Here comes Mr. Sanchy with an impertinent business
to me of a ticket, which I put off. But by and by comes Dr. Childe by
appointment, and sat with me all the morning making me bases and inward
parts to several songs that I desired of him, to my great content. Then
dined, and then abroad by coach, and I set him down at Hatton Garden,
and I to the King’s house by chance, where a new play: so full as I
never saw it; I forced to stand all the while close to the very door
till I took cold, and many people went away for want of room. The King,
and Queene, and Duke of York and Duchesse there, and all the Court, and
Sir W. Coventry. The play called “The Change of Crownes;” a play of Ned
Howard’s, the best that ever I saw at that house, being a great play and
serious; only Lacy did act the country-gentleman come up to Court,
who do abuse the Court with all the imaginable wit and plainness about
selling of places, and doing every thing for money. The play took
very much. Thence I to my new bookseller’s, and there bought “Hooker’s
Polity,” the new edition, and “Dugdale’s History of the Inns of Court,”
 of which there was but a few saved out of the fire, and Playford’s new
Catch-book, that hath a great many new fooleries in it. Then home, a
little at the office, and then to supper and to bed, mightily pleased
with the new play.
