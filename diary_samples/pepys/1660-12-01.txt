December 1st. This morning, observing some things to be laid up not as
they should be by the girl, I took a broom and basted her till she
cried extremely, which made me vexed, but before I went out I left her
appeased. So to Whitehall, where I found Mr. Moore attending for me at
the Privy Seal, but nothing to do to-day. I went to my Lord St. Albans
lodgings, and found him in bed, talking to a priest (he looked like one)
that leaned along over the side of the bed, and there I desired to know
his mind about making the catch stay longer, which I got ready for him
the other day. He seems to be a fine civil gentleman. To my Lord’s, and
did give up my audit of his accounts, which I had been then two days
about, and was well received by my Lord. I dined with my Lord and Lady,
and we had a venison pasty. Mr. Shepley and I went into London, and
calling upon Mr. Pinkney, the goldsmith, he took us to the tavern, and
gave us a pint of wine, and there fell into our company old Mr. Flower
and another gentleman; who tell us how a Scotch knight was killed basely
the other day at the Fleece in Covent Garden, where there had been a
great many formerly killed. So to Paul’s Churchyard, and there I took
the little man at Mr. Kirton’s and Mr. Shepley to Ringstead’s at the
Star, and after a pint of wine I went home, my brains somewhat troubled
with so much wine, and after a letter or two by the post I went to bed.
