26th. Up, and with Sir W. Pen to White Hall, and there with the rest did
our usual business before the Duke, and then with Sir W. Batten back
and to his house, where I by sicknesse excused my wife’s coming to them
to-day. Thence I to the Coffeehouse, where much good discourse, and all
the opinion now is that the Dutch will avoid fighting with us at home,
but do all the hurte they can to us abroad; which it may be they may for
a while, but that, I think, cannot support them long. Thence to Sir W.
Batten’s, where Mr. Coventry and all our families here, women and all,
and Sir R. Ford and his, and a great feast and good discourse and merry,
there all the afternoon and evening till late, only stepped in to see
my wife, then to my office to enter my day’s work, and so home to bed,
where my people and wife innocently at cards very merry, and I to bed,
leaving them to their sport and blindman’s buff.
