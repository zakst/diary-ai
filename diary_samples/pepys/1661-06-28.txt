28th. At home all the morning practising to sing, which is now my great
trade, and at noon to my Lady and dined with her. So back and to the
office, and there sat till 7 at night, and then Sir W. Pen and I in
his coach went to Moorefields, and there walked, and stood and saw the
wrestling, which I never saw so much of before, between the north and
west countrymen. So home, and this night had our bed set up in our room
that we called the Nursery, where we lay, and I am very much pleased
with the room.
