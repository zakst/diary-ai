12th. Up between four and five, and after dressing myself then to my
office to prepare business against the afternoon, where all the morning,
and dined at noon at home, where a little angry with my wife for minding
nothing now but the dancing-master, having him come twice a day, which
is a folly. Again, to my office. We sat till late, our chief business
being the reconciling the business of the pieces of eight mentioned
yesterday before the Duke of York, wherein I have got the day, and they
are all brought over to what I said, of which I am proud. Late writing
letters, and so home to supper and to bed. Here I found Creed staying
for me, and so after supper I staid him all night and lay with me, our
great discourse being the folly of our two doting knights, of which I am
ashamed.
