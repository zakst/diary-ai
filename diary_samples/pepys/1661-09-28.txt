28th. At the office in the morning, dined at home, and then Sir W.
Pen and his daughter and I and my wife to the Theatre, and there saw
“Father’s own Son,” a very good play, and the first time I ever saw
it, and so at night to my house, and there sat and talked and drank and
merrily broke up, and to bed.
