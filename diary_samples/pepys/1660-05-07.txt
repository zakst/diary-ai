7th. This morning Captain Cuttance sent me 12 bottles of Margate ale.
Three of them I drank presently with some friends in the Coach. My
Lord went this morning about the flag-ships in a boat, to see what
alterations there must be, as to the arms and flags. He did give me
order also to write for silk flags and scarlett waistcloathes.

     [Waist-cloths are the painted canvas coverings of the hammocks which
     are stowed in the waist-nettings.]

For a rich barge; for a noise of trumpets,

     [A set or company of musicians, an expression constantly used by old
     writers without any disparaging meaning.  It is sometimes applied to
     voices as well as to instruments.]

and a set of fidlers. Very great deal of company come today, among
others Mr. Bellasses, Sir Thomas Lenthropp, Sir Henry Chichley, Colonel
Philip Honiwood, and Captain Titus, the last of whom my Lord showed all
our cabins, and I suppose he is to take notice what room there will be
for the King’s entertainment. Here were also all the Jurates of the town
of Dover come to give my Lord a visit, and after dinner all went away.
I could not but observe that the Vice-Admiral after dinner came into the
great cabin below, where the Jurates and I and the commanders for want
of room dined, and there told us we must drink a health to the King,
and himself called for a bottle of wine, and begun his and the Duke of
York’s. In the afternoon I lost 5s. at ninepins. After supper musique,
and to bed. Having also among us at the Coach table wrote a letter to
the French ambassador, in French, about the release of a ship we had
taken. After I was in bed Mr. Sheply and W. Howe came and sat in my
cabin, where I gave them three bottles of Margate ale, and sat laughing
and very merry, till almost one o’clock in the morning, and so good
night.
