5th. All the morning very busy writing letters to London, and a packet
to Mr. Downing, to acquaint him with what had been done lately in the
fleet. And this I did by my Lordâ€™s command, who, I thank him, did of
himself think of doing it, to do me a kindness, for he writ a letter
himself to him, thanking him for his kindness to me. All the afternoon
at ninepins, at night after supper good musique, my Lord, Mr. North, I
and W. Howe. After that to bed. This evening came Dr. Clarges to Deal,
going to the King; where the towns-people strewed the streets with
herbes against his coming, for joy of his going. Never was there so
general a content as there is now. I cannot but remember that our parson
did, in his prayer to-night, pray for the long life and happiness of
our King and dread Soveraign, that may last as long as the sun and moon
endureth.
