23), but by another act of the same session (c. 48), entitled “An
     Act for the Abbreviation of Michaelmas Term,” by which it was
     enacted, “that from and after the said feast of St. Michael, which
     shall be in the year 1752, the said solemnity of presenting and
     swearing the mayors of the city of London, after every annual
     election into the said office, in the manner and form heretofore
     used on the 29th day of October, shall be kept and observed on the
     ninth day of November in every year, unless the same shall fall on
     a Sunday, and in that case on the day following.”]

(Sir Richd. Browne), and neglecting my office I went to the Wardrobe,
where I met my Lady Sandwich and all the children; and after drinking of
some strange and incomparable good clarett of Mr. Rumball’s he and Mr.
Townsend did take us, and set the young Lords at one Mr. Nevill’s, a
draper in Paul’s churchyard; and my Lady and my Lady Pickering and I to
one Mr. Isaacson’s, a linendraper at the Key in Cheapside; where there
was a company of fine ladies, and we were very civilly treated, and had
a very good place to see the pageants, which were many, and I believe
good, for such kind of things, but in themselves but poor and absurd.
After the ladies were placed I took Mr. Townsend and Isaacson to the
next door, a tavern, and did spend 5s. upon them. The show being done,
we got as far as Paul’s with much ado, where I left my Lady in the
coach, and went on foot with my Lady Pickering to her lodging, which was
a poor one in Blackfryars, where she never invited me to go in at all,
which methought was very strange for her to do. So home, where I was
told how my Lady Davis is now come to our next lodgings, and has locked
up the leads door from me, which puts me into so great a disquiet that I
went to bed, and could not sleep till morning at it.
