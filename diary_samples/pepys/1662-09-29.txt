29th. Early up, and brought all my money, which is near L300, out of my
house into this chamber; and so to the office, and there we sat all the
morning, Sir George Carteret and Mr. Coventry being come from sea. This
morning among other things I broached the business of our being abused
about flags, which I know doth trouble Sir W. Batten, but I care not.
At noon being invited I went with Sir George and Mr. Coventry to Sir W.
Battenâ€™s to dinner, and there merry, and very friendly to Sir Wm. and he
to me, and complies much with me, but I know he envies me, and I do not
value him. To the office again, and in the evening walked to Deptford
(Cooper with me talking of mathematiques), to send a fellow to prison
for cutting of buoy ropes, and to see the difference between the flags
sent in now-a-days, and I find the old ones, which were much cheaper,
to be wholly as good. So I took one of a sort with me, and Mr. Wayth
accompanying of me a good way, talking of the faults of the Navy, I
walked to Redriffe back, and so home by water, and after having done,
late, at the office, I went to my chamber and to bed.
