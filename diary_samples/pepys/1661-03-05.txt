5th. With Mr. Pierce, purser, to Westminster Hall, and there met with
Captain Cuttance, Lieut. Lambert, and Pierce, surgeon, thinking to have
met with the Commissioners of Parliament, but they not sitting, we went
to the Swan, where I did give them a barrel of oysters; and so I to my
Lady’s and there dined, and had very much talk and pleasant discourse
with my Lady, my esteem growing every day higher and higher in her
and my Lord. So to my father Bowyer’s where my wife was, and to the
Commissioners of Parliament, and there did take some course about having
my Lord’s salary paid tomorrow when; the Charles is paid off, but I
was troubled to see how high they carry themselves, when in good truth
nobody cares for them. So home by coach and my wife. I then to the
office, where Sir Williams both and I set about making an estimate of
all the officers’ salaries in ordinary in the Navy till 10 o’clock at
night. So home, and I with my head full of thoughts how to get a little
present money, I eat a bit of bread and cheese, and so to bed.
