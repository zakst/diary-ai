9th. Up, and did give the servants something at Mr. Glanville’s and so
took leave, meaning to lie to-night at my owne lodging. To my office,
where busy with Mr. Gawden running over the Victualling business, and he
is mightily pleased that this course is taking and seems sensible of
my favour and promises kindnesse to me. At noon by water, to the King’s
Head at Deptford, where Captain Taylor invites Sir W: Batten, Sir John
Robinson (who come in with a great deale of company from hunting, and
brought in a hare alive and a great many silly stories they tell of
their sport, which pleases them mightily, and me not at all, such is the
different sense of pleasure in mankind), and others upon the score of
a survey of his new ship; and strange to see how a good dinner and
feasting reconciles everybody, Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Robinson being
now as kind to him, and report well of his ship and proceedings, and
promise money, and Sir W. Batten is a solicitor for him, but it is a
strange thing to observe, they being the greatest enemys he had, and
yet, I believe, hath in the world in their hearts. Thence after dinner
stole away and to my office, where did a great deale of business till
midnight, and then to Mrs. Clerk’s, to lodge again, and going home W.
Hewer did tell me my wife will be here to-morrow, and hath put away
Mary, which vexes me to the heart, I cannot helpe it, though it may be a
folly in me, and when I think seriously on it, I think my wife means
no ill design in it, or, if she do, I am a foole to be troubled at it,
since I cannot helpe it. The Bill of Mortality, to all our griefs, is
encreased 399 this week, and the encrease generally through the whole
City and suburbs, which makes us all sad.
