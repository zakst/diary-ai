19th (Office day). After we had done a little at the office this
morning, I went with the Treasurer in his coach to White Hall, and in
our way, in discourse, do find him a very good-natured man; and, talking
of those men who now stand condemned for murdering the King, he says
that he believes that, if the law would give leave, the King is a man of
so great compassion that he would wholly acquit them. Going to my Lord’s
I met with Mr. Shepley, and so he and I to the Sun, and I did give him a
morning draft of Muscadine.

     [Muscadine or muscadel, a rich sort of wine.  ‘Vinum muscatum quod
     moschi odorem referat.’

              “Quaffed off the muscadel, and threw the sops
               All in the sexton’s face.”

               Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, act iii.  SC. 2.--M. B.]

And so to see my Lord’s picture at De Cretz, and he says it is very like
him, and I say so too. After that to Westminster Hall, and there hearing
that Sir W. Batten was at the Leg in the Palace, I went thither, and
there dined with him and some of the Trinity House men who had obtained
something to-day at the House of Lords concerning the Ballast Office.
After dinner I went by water to London to the Globe in Cornhill, and
there did choose two pictures to hang up in my house, which my wife
did not like when I came home, and so I sent the picture of Paris back
again. To the office, where we sat all the afternoon till night. So
home, and there came Mr. Beauchamp to me with the gilt tankard, and I
did pay him for it L20. So to my musique and sat up late at it, and so
to bed, leaving my wife to sit up till 2 o’clock that she may call the
wench up to wash.
