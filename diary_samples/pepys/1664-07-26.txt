26th. All the morning at the office, at noon to Anthony Joyce’s, to
our gossip’s dinner. I had sent a dozen and a half of bottles of wine
thither, and paid my double share besides, which is 18s. Very merry we
were, and when the women were merry and rose from table, I above
with them, ne’er a man but I, I began discourse of my not getting of
children, and prayed them to give me their opinions and advice, and they
freely and merrily did give me these ten, among them (1) Do not hug my
wife too hard nor too much; (2) eat no late suppers; (3) drink juyce
of sage; (4) tent and toast; (5) wear cool holland drawers; (6) keep
stomach warm and back cool; (7) upon query whether it was best to do at
night or morn, they answered me neither one nor other, but when we had
most mind to it; (8) wife not to go too straight laced; (9) myself to
drink mum and sugar; (10) Mrs. Ward did give me, to change my place.
