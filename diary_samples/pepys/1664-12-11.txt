11th (Lord’s day). Up and to church alone in the morning. Dined at home,
mighty pleasantly. In the afternoon I to the French church, where much
pleased with the three sisters of the parson, very handsome, especially
in their noses, and sing prettily. I heard a good sermon of the old man,
touching duty to parents. Here was Sir Samuel Morland and his lady very
fine, with two footmen in new liverys (the church taking much notice of
them), and going into their coach after sermon with great gazeing. So
I home, and my cozen, Mary Pepys’s husband, comes after me, and told me
that out of the money he received some months since he did receive 18d.
too much, and did now come and give it me, which was very pretty.
So home, and there found Mr. Andrews and his lady, a well-bred and a
tolerable pretty woman, and by and by Mr. Hill and to singing, and then
to supper, then to sing again, and so good night. To prayers and tonight
[bed]. It is a little strange how these Psalms of Ravenscroft after 2
or 3 times singing prove but the same again, though good. No diversity
appearing at all almost.
