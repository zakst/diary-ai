9th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, not to church, but to my chamber, and there begun
to enter into this book my journall of September, which in the fire-time
I could not enter here, but in loose papers. At noon dined, and then
to my chamber all the afternoon and night, looking over and tearing and
burning all the unnecessary letters, which I have had upon my file for
four or five years backward, which I intend to do quite through all my
papers, that I may have nothing by me but what is worth keeping, and fit
to be seen, if I should miscarry. At this work till midnight, and then
to supper and to bed.
