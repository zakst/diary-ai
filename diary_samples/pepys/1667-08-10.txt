10th. Up, and to the Office, and there finished the letter about
Carcasse, and sent it away, I think well writ, though it troubles me we
should be put to trouble by this rogue so much. At the office all the
morning, and at noon home to dinner, where I sang and piped with my
wife with great pleasure, and did hire a coach to carry us to Barnett
to-morrow. After dinner I to the office, and there wrote as long as my
eyes would give me leave, and then abroad and to the New Exchange,
to the bookseller’s there, where I hear of several new books coming
out--Mr. Spratt’s History of the Royal Society, and Mrs. Phillips’s’
poems. Sir John Denham’s poems are going to be all printed together;
and, among others, some new things; and among them he showed me a copy
of verses of his upon Sir John Minnes’s going heretofore to Bullogne to
eat a pig.

     [The collected edition of Denham’s poems is dated 1668.  The verses
     referred to are inscribed “To Sir John Mennis being invited from
     Calice to Bologne to eat a pig,” and two of the lines run

                   “Little Admiral John
                    To Bologne is gone.”]

Cowley, he tells me, is dead; who, it seems, was a mighty civil, serious
man; which I did not know before. Several good plays are likely to
be abroad soon, as Mustapha and Henry the 5th. Here having staid and
divertised myself a good while, I home again and to finish my letters by
the post, and so home, and betimes to bed with my wife because of rising
betimes to-morrow.
