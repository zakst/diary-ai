2nd. (Lordâ€™s day). Up and at home all the morning, hanging, and removing
of some pictures, in my study and house. At noon Pelling dined with me.
After dinner, I and Tom, my boy, by water up to Putney, and there heard
a sermon, and many fine people in the church. Thence walked to Barne
Elmes, and there, and going and coming, did make the boy read to me
several things, being now-a-days unable to read myself anything, for
above two lines together, but my eyes grow weary. Home about night, and
so to supper and then to bed.
