6th. Lay long in bed, but most of it angry and scolding with my wife
about her warning Jane our cookemayde to be gone and upon that she
desires to go abroad to-day to look a place. A very good mayde she is
and fully to my mind, being neat, only they say a little apt to scold,
but I hear her not. To my office all the morning busy. Dined at home.
To my office again, being pretty well reconciled to my wife, which I
did desire to be, because she had designed much mirthe to-day to end
Christmas with among her servants. At night home, being twelfenight, and
there chose my piece of cake, but went up to my viall, and then to bed,
leaving my wife and people up at their sports, which they continue till
morning, not coming to bed at all.
