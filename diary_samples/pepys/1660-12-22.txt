22nd. All the morning with my painters, who will make an end of all this
day I hope. At noon I went to the Sun tavern; on Fish Street hill, to a
dinner of Captn. Teddimans, where was my Lord Inchiquin (who seems to be
a very fine person), Sir W. Pen, Captn. Cuttance, and one Mr. Lawrence
(a fine gentleman now going to Algiers), and other good company, where
we had a very fine dinner, good musique, and a great deal of wine. We
staid here very late, at last Sir W. Pen and I home together, he so
overcome with wine that he could hardly go; I was forced to lead him
through the streets and he was in a very merry and kind mood. I home
(found my house clear of the workmen and their work ended), my head
troubled with wine, and I very merry went to bed, my head akeing all
night.
