4th. This morning I was busy looking over papers at the office all
alone, and being visited by Lieut. Lambert of the Charles (to whom I was
formerly much beholden), I took him along with me to a little alehouse
hard by our office, whither my cozen Thomas Pepys the turner had sent
for me to show me two gentlemen that had a great desire to be known to
me, one his name is Pepys, of our family, but one that I never heard of
before, and the other a younger son of Sir Tho. Bendishes, and so we
all called cozens. After sitting awhile and drinking, my two new cozens,
myself, and Lieut. Lambert went by water to Whitehall, and from thence
I and Lieut. Lambert to Westminster Abbey, where we saw Dr. Frewen
translated to the Archbishoprick of York. Here I saw the Bishops of
Winchester, Bangor, Rochester, Bath and Wells, and Salisbury, all in
their habits, in King Henry Seventh’s chappell. But, Lord! at their
going out, how people did most of them look upon them as strange
creatures, and few with any kind of love or respect. From thence at 2
to my Lord’s, where we took Mr. Sheply and Wm. Howe to the Raindeer, and
had some oysters, which were very good, the first I have eat this year.
So back to my Lord’s to dinner, and after dinner Lieut. Lambert and I
did look upon my Lord’s model, and he told me many things in a ship that
I desired to understand. From thence by water I (leaving Lieut. Lambert
at Blackfriars) went home, and there by promise met with Robert Shaw and
Jack Spicer, who came to see me, and by the way I met upon Tower Hill
with Mr. Pierce the surgeon and his wife, and took them home and did
give them good wine, ale, and anchovies, and staid them till night,
and so adieu. Then to look upon my painters that are now at work in my
house. At night to bed.
