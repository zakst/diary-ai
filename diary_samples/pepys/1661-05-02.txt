2nd. Up, and Mr. Creed and I to walk round the town upon the walls. Then
to our inn, and there all the officers of the Yard to see me with great
respect, and I walked with them to the Dock and saw all the stores, and
much pleased with the sight of the place. Back and brought them all
to dinner with me, and treated them handsomely; and so after dinner by
water to the Yard, and there we made the sale of the old provisions.
Then we and our wives all to see the Montagu, which is a fine ship, and
so to the town again by water, and then to see the room where the Duke
of Buckingham was killed by Felton.--1628. So to our lodging, and to
supper and to bed. To-night came Mr. Stevens to town to help us to pay
off the Fox.
