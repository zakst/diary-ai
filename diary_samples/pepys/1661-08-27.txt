27th. This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward
Rye in their way to France, whom God bless. Then I was called up to
my Lady’s bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr. Edward Montagu’s
disposing of the L5000 for my Lord’s departure for Portugal, and our
fears that he will not do it to my Lord’s honour, and less to his
profit, which I am to enquire a little after. Hence to the office, and
there sat till noon, and then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.
Pepys, the Executor, to dinner, where some ladies and my father and
mother, where very merry, but methinks he makes but poor dinners for
such guests, though there was a poor venison pasty. Hence my wife and I
to the Theatre, and there saw “The Joviall Crew,” where the King, Duke
and Duchess, and Madame Palmer, were; and my wife, to her great content,
had a full sight of them all the while. The play full of mirth. Hence
to my father’s, and there staid to talk a while and so by foot home by
moonshine. In my way and at home, my wife making a sad story to me of
her brother Balty’s a condition, and would have me to do something for
him, which I shall endeavour to do, but am afeard to meddle therein
for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands of him again, when I once
concern myself for him. I went to bed, my wife all the while telling me
his case with tears, which troubled me.
