17th. Up, and Mr. Mayland comes to me and borrowed 30s. of me to be paid
again out of the money coming to him in the James and Charles for his
late voyage. So to the office, where all the morning. So home to dinner,
my wife not being well, but however dined with me. So to the office,
and at Sir W. Battenâ€™s, where we all met by chance and talked, and
they drank wine; but I forebore all their healths. Sir John Minnes,
I perceive, is most excellent company. So home and to bed betimes by
daylight.
