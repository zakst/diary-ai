16th. In bed till 12 o’clock. This morning came several maids to my wife
to be hired, and at last she pitched upon one Nell, whose mother, an old
woman, came along with her, but would not be hired under half a year,
which I am pleased at their drollness. This day dined by appointment
with me, Dr. Thos. Pepys and my Coz: Snow, and my brother Tom, upon a
fin of ling and some sounds, neither of which did I ever know before,
but most excellent meat they are both, that in all my life I never eat
the like fish. So after dinner came in W. Joyce and eat and drank and
were merry. So up to my chamber, and put all my papers, at rights, and
in the evening our maid Mary. (who was with us upon trial for a month)
did take leave of us, going as we suppose to be married, for the maid
liked us and we her, but all she said was that she had a mind to live
in a tradesman’s house where there was but one maid. So to supper and to
bed.
