7th. This morning comes Captain Ferrers and the German, Emanuel Luffe,
who goes as one of my Lord’s footmen, though he deserves a much better
preferment, to take their leave of me, and here I got the German to play
upon my theorbo, which he did both below and in my wife’s chamber,
who was in bed. He plays bravely. I find by him that my lute is a most
excellent lute. I did give them a mince pie and a collar of brawn and
some wine for their breakfast, and were very merry, and sent for Mr.
Adamson’s neighbour to drink Mr. Shepley’s health. At last we all
parted, but within a quarter of an hour after they were gone, and my
wife and I were talking about buying of a fine scallop which is brought
her this morning by a woman to be sold, which is to cost her 45s., in
comes the German back again, all in a goare of blood, which I wondered
at, and tells me that he is afeard that the Captain is killed by the
watermen at Towre Stayres; so I presently went thither, and found that
upon some rude pressing of the watermen to ply the Captain, he struck
one of them with his cane, which they would not take, but struck him
again, and then the German drew his sword and ran at one of them, but
they were both soundly beaten.
