14th. Up about seven and finished our papers, he and I, and I delivered
him tallys and some money and so away I to the office, where we sat all
the morning. At noon dined at home and Creed with me, then parted, and I
to the office, and anon called thence by Sir H. Cholmley and he and I to
my chamber, and there settled our matters of accounts, and did give
him tallys and money to clear him, and so he being gone and all these
accounts cleared I shall be even with the King, so as to make a very
clear and short account in a very few days, which pleases me very well.
Here he and I discoursed a great while about Tangier, and he do convince
me, as things are now ordered by my Lord Bellasses and will be by
Norwood (men that do only mind themselves), the garrison will never come
to any thing, and he proposes his owne being governor, which in truth I
do think will do very well, and that he will bring it to something.
He gone I to my office, where to write letters late, and then home and
looked over a little more my papers of accounts lately passed, and so to
bed.
