8th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and at my chamber all the morning, setting papers
to rights, with my boy; and so to dinner at noon. The girle with us, but
my wife troubled thereat to see her, and do tell me so, which troubles
me, for I love the girle. At my chamber again to work all the afternoon
till night, when Pelling comes, who wonders to find my wife so dull and
melancholy, but God knows she hath too much cause. However, as pleasant
as we can, we supped together, and so made the boy read to me, the poor
girle not appearing at supper, but hid herself in her chamber. So that I
could wish in that respect that she was out of the house, for our peace
is broke to all of us while she is here, and so to bed, where my wife
mighty unquiet all night, so as my bed is become burdensome to me.
