5th. A-bed late. In the morning my Lord went on shore with the
Vice-Admiral a-fishing, and at dinner returned. In the afternoon I
played at ninepins with my Lord, and when he went in again I got him to
sign my accounts for L115, and so upon my private balance I find myself
confirmed in my estimation that I am worth L100. In the evening in my
cabin a great while getting the song without book, “Help, help Divinity,
&c.” After supper my Lord called for the lieutenant’s cittern, and
with two candlesticks with money in them for symballs, we made barber’s
music,

     [In the “Notices of Popular Histories,” printed for the Percy
     Society, there is a curious woodcut representing the interior of a
     barber’s shop, in which, according to the old custom, the person
     waiting to be shaved is playing on the “ghittern” till his turn
     arrives.  Decker also mentions a “barber’s cittern,” for every
     serving-man to play upon.  This is no doubt “the barber’s music”
      with which Lord Sandwich entertained himself.--B.]

with which my Lord was well pleased. So to bed.
