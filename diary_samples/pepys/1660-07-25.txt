25th. In the morning at the office, and after that down to Whitehall,
where I met with Mr. Creed, and with him and a Welsh schoolmaster, a
good scholar but a very pedagogue, to the ordinary at the Leg in King
Street.’ I got my certificate of my Lord’s and my being sworn. This
morning my Lord took leave of the House of Commons, and had the thanks
of the House for his great services to his country. In the afternoon
(but this is a mistake, for it was yesterday in the afternoon) Monsieur
L’Impertinent and I met and I took him to the Sun and drank with him,
and in the evening going away we met his mother and sisters and father
coming from the Gatehouse; where they lodge, where I did the first time
salute them all, and very pretty Madame Frances--[Frances Butler, the
beauty.]--is indeed. After that very late home and called in Tower
Street, and there at a barber’s was trimmed the first time. Home and to
bed.
