6th (Lord’s day). Up pretty well in the morning, and then to church,
where a dull doctor, a stranger, made a dull sermon. Then home, and
Betty Michell and her husband come by invitation to dine with us, and,
she I find the same as ever (which I was afraid of the contrary)... Here
come also Mr. Howe to dine with me, and we had a good dinner and good
merry discourse with much pleasure, I enjoying myself mightily to have
friends at my table. After dinner young Michell and I, it being an
excellent frosty day to walk, did walk out, he showing me the baker’s
house in Pudding Lane, where the late great fire begun; and thence
all along Thames Street, where I did view several places, and so up by
London Wall, by Blackfriars, to Ludgate; and thence to Bridewell, which
I find to have been heretofore an extraordinary good house, and a fine
coming to it, before the house by the bridge was built; and so to look
about St. Bride’s church and my father’s house, and so walked home,
and there supped together, and then Michell and Betty home, and I to my
closet, there to read and agree upon my vows for next year, and so to
bed and slept mighty well.
