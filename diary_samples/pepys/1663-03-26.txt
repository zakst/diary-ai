26th. Up betimes and to my office, leaving my wife in bed to take her
physique, myself also not being out of some pain to-day by some cold
that I have got by the sudden change of the weather from hot to cold.
This day is five years since it pleased God to preserve me at my being
cut of the stone, of which I bless God I am in all respects well. Only
now and then upon taking cold I have some pain, but otherwise in very
good health always. But I could not get my feast to be kept to-day as
it used to be, because of my wife’s being ill and other disorders by my
servants being out of order. This morning came a new cook-maid at L4 per
annum, the first time I ever did give so much, but we hope it will be
nothing lost by keeping a good cook. She did live last at my Lord Monk’s
house, and indeed at dinner did get what there was very prettily ready
and neat for me, which did please me much. This morning my uncle Thomas
was with me according to agreement, and I paid him the L50, which was
against my heart to part with, and yet I must be contented; I used him
very kindly, and I desire to continue so voyd of any discontent as to
my estate, that I may follow my business the better. At the Change I
met him again, with intent to have met with my uncle Wight to have
made peace with him, with whom by my long absence I fear I shall have a
difference, but he was not there, so we missed. All the afternoon sat
at the office about business till 9 or 10 at night, and so dispatch
business and home to supper and to bed. My maid Susan went away to-day,
I giving her something for her lodging and diet somewhere else a while
that I might have room for my new maid.
