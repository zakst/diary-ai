13th. By appointment, we all went this morning to wait upon the Duke
of York, which we did in his chamber, as he was dressing himself in his
riding suit to go this day by sea to the Downs. He is in mourning for
his wife’s grandmother, which is thought a great piece of fondness.

     [Fondness, foolishness.

              “Fondness it were for any, being free,
               To covet fetters, tho’ they golden be.”
                                    Spenser, Sonnet 37,--M. B.]

After we had given him our letter relating the bad condition of the Navy
for want of money, he referred it to his coming back and so parted, and
I to Whitehall and to see la belle Pierce, and so on foot to my Lord
Crew’s, where I found him come to his new house, which is next to that
he lived in last; here I was well received by my Lord and Sir Thomas,
with whom I had great talk: and he tells me in good earnest that he do
believe the Parliament (which comes to sit again the next week), will
be troublesome to the Court and Clergy, which God forbid! But they see
things carried so by my Lord Chancellor and some others, that get money
themselves, that they will not endure it. From thence to the Theatre,
and there saw “Father’s own Son” again, and so it raining very hard
I went home by coach, with my mind very heavy for this my expensefull
life, which will undo me, I fear, after all my hopes, if I do not take
up, for now I am coming to lay out a great deal of money in clothes for
my wife, I must forbear other expenses. To bed, and this night began to
lie in the little green chamber, where the maids lie, but we could not a
great while get Nell to lie there, because I lie there and my wife, but
at last, when she saw she must lie there or sit up, she, with much ado,
came to bed.
