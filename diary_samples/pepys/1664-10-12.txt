12th. This morning all the morning at my office ordering things against
my journey to-morrow. At noon to the Coffeehouse, where very good
discourse. For newes, all say De Ruyter is gone to Guinny before us. Sir
J. Lawson is come to Portsmouth; and our fleete is hastening all speed:
I mean this new fleete. Prince Rupert with his is got into the Downes.
At home dined with me W. Joyce and a friend of his. W. Joyce will go
with me to Brampton. After dinner I out to Mr. Bridges, the linnen
draper, and evened with (him) for 100 pieces of callico, and did give
him L208 18s., which I now trust the King for, but hope both to save
the King money and to get a little by it to boot. Thence by water up
and down all the timber yards to look out some Dram timber, but can find
none for our turne at the price I would have; and so I home, and there
at my office late doing business against my journey to clear my hands of
every thing for two days. So home and to supper and bed.
