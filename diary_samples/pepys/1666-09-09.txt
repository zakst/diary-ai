9th (Sunday). Up and was trimmed, and sent my brother to Woolwich to my
wife, to dine with her. I to church, where our parson made a melancholy
but good sermon; and many and most in the church cried, specially the
women. The church mighty full; but few of fashion, and most strangers.
I walked to Bednall Green, and there dined well, but a bad venison pasty
at Sir W. Rider’s. Good people they are, and good discourse; and his
daughter, Middleton, a fine woman, discreet. Thence home, and to church
again, and there preached Dean Harding; but, methinks, a bad, poor
sermon, though proper for the time; nor eloquent, in saying at this time
that the City is reduced from a large folio to a decimotertio. So to my
office, there to write down my journall, and take leave of my brother,
whom I sent back this afternoon, though rainy; which it hath not done a
good while before. But I had no room or convenience for him here till
my house is fitted; but I was very kind to him, and do take very well
of him his journey. I did give him 40s. for his pocket, and so, he being
gone, and, it presently rayning, I was troubled for him, though it is
good for the fyre. Anon to Sir W. Pen’s to bed, and made my boy Tom to
read me asleep.
