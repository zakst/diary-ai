4s. among them, and mighty merry. So home to bed, with my heart at great
rest and quiett, saving that the consideration of the victory is too
great for me presently to comprehend.

     [Mrs. Ady (Julia Cartwright), in her fascinating life of Henrietta,
     Duchess of Orleans, gives an account of the receipt of the news of
     the great sea-fight in Paris, and quotes a letter of Charles II. to
     his sister, dated, “Whitehall, June 8th, 1665”  The first report
     that reached Paris was that “the Duke of York’s ship had been blown
     up, and he himself had been drowned.”  “The shock was too much for
     Madame...  she was seized with convulsions, and became so
     dangerously ill that Lord Hollis wrote to the king, ‘If things had
     gone ill at sea I really believe Madame would have died.’”  Charles
     wrote: “I thanke God we have now the certayne newes of a very
     considerable victory over the Duch; you will see most of the
     particulars by the relation my Lord Hopis will shew you, though I
     have had as great a losse as ‘tis possible in a good frinde, poore
     C. Barckely.  It troubles me so much, as I hope you will excuse the
     shortnesse of this letter, haveing receaved the newes of it but two
     houres agoe” (“Madame,” 1894, pp.  215, 216).]
