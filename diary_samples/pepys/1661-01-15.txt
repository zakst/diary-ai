15th. Up and down the yard all the morning and seeing the seamen
exercise, which they do already very handsomely. Then to dinner at Mr.
Ackworth’s, where there also dined with us one Captain Bethell, a friend
of the Comptroller’s. A good dinner and very handsome. After that
and taking our leaves of the officers of the yard, we walked to the
waterside and in our way walked into the rope-yard, where I do look
into the tar-houses and other places, and took great notice of all the
several works belonging to the making of a cable. So after a cup of
burnt wine--[Burnt wine was somewhat similar to mulled wine, and
a favourite drink]--at the tavern there, we took barge and went to
Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock, which is newly made
there, and a brave new merchantman which is to be launched shortly, and
they say to be called the Royal Oak. Hence we walked to Dick-Shore, and
thence to the Towre and so home. Where I found my wife and Pall abroad,
so I went to see Sir W. Pen, and there found Mr. Coventry come to see
him, and now had an opportunity to thank him, and he did express much
kindness to me. I sat a great while with Sir Wm. after he was gone, and
had much talk with him. I perceive none of our officers care much for
one another, but I do keep in with them all as much as I can. Sir W. Pen
is still very ill as when I went. Home, where my wife not yet come home,
so I went up to put my papers in order, and then was much troubled my
wife was not come, it being 10 o’clock just now striking as I write this
last line. This day I hear the Princess is recovered again. The King
hath been this afternoon at Deptford, to see the yacht that Commissioner
Pett is building, which will be very pretty; as also that that his
brother at Woolwich is in making. By and by comes in my boy and tells
me that his mistress do lie this night at Mrs. Hunt’s, who is very ill,
with which being something satisfied, I went to bed.
