23rd (Lordâ€™s day). Up and to church. At noon comes unexpected Mr.
Fuller, the minister, and dines with me, and also I had invited Mr.
Cooper with one I judge come from sea, and he and I spent the whole
afternoon together, he teaching me some things in understanding of
plates. At night to the office, doing business, and then home to supper.
Then a psalm, to prayers, and to bed.
