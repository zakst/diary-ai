30th. All the morning at the office. At noon played on my Theorbo,
and much pleased therewith; it is now altered with a new neck. In the
afternoon Captain Lambert called me out by appointment, and we walked
together to Deptford, and there in his ship, the Norwich, I got him to
shew me every hole and corner of the ship, much to my information, and
the purpose of my going. So home again, and at Sir W. Batten’s heard how
he had been already at Sir R. Slingsby’s, as we were all invited, and I
intended this night to go, and there he finds all things out of order,
and no such thing done to-night, but pretending that the corps stinks,
they will bury it to-night privately, and so will unbespeak all their
guests, and there shall be no funerall, which I am sorry for, that there
should be nothing done for the honour of Sir Robert, but I fear he hath
left his family in great distraction. Here I staid till late at cards
with my Lady and Mrs. Martha, and so home. I sent for a bottle or two
of wine thither. At my coming home I am sorry to find my wife displeased
with her maid Doll, whose fault is that she cannot keep her peace, but
will always be talking in an angry manner, though it be without
any reason and to no purpose, which I am sorry for and do see the
inconvenience that do attend the increase of a man’s fortune by being
forced to keep more servants, which brings trouble. Sir Henry Vane,
Lambert, and others, are lately sent suddenly away from the Tower,
prisoners to Scilly; but I do not think there is any plot as is said,
but only a pretence; as there was once pretended often against the
Cavaliers.
