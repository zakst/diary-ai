3rd. Up, and to the Office, where busy till it was time to go to
the Commissioners of Accounts, which I did about noon, and there was
received with all possible respect, their business being only to
explain the meaning of one of their late demands to us, which we had not
answered in our answer to them, and, this being done, I away with great
content, my mind being troubled before, and so to the Exchequer and
several places, calling on several businesses, and particularly my
bookseller’s, among others, for “Hobbs’s Leviathan,”

     [“Leviathan: or the matter, forme and power of a Commonwealth
     ecclesiasticall and civill,” by Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, first
     published in 1651.  It was reprinted in 1680, with its old date.
     Hobbes’s complete works, English and Latin, were published by Sir
     William Molesworth in sixteen volumes 8vo. between 1839 and 1845.]

which is now mightily called for; and what was heretofore sold for 8s. I
now give 24s. for, at the second hand, and is sold for 30s., it being a
book the Bishops will not let be printed again, and so home to dinner,
and then to the office all the afternoon, and towards evening by water
to the Commissioners of the Treasury, and presently back again, and
there met a little with W. Pen and the rest about our Prize accounts,
and so W. Pen and Lord Brouncker and I at the lodging of the latter to
read over our new draft of the victualler’s contract, and so broke up
and home to supper and to bed.
