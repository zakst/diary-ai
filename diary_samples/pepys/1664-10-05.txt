5s. per oz. more--nay, some say 10s. an ounce the fashion. But I do not
believe, but yet am sorry to see that the fashion is worth so much, and
the silver come to no more. So home and to my office, where very busy
late. My wife at Mercer’s mother’s, I believe, W. Hewer with them, which
I do not like, that he should ask my leave to go about business, and
then to go and spend his time in sport, and leave me here busy. To
supper and to bed, my wife coming in by and by, which though I know
there was no hurt in it; I do not like.
