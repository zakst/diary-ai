May 1st. Sir G. Carteret, Sir W. Pen, and myself, with our clerks,
set out this morning from Portsmouth very early, and got by noon to
Petersfield; several officers of the Yard accompanying us so far.
Here we dined and were merry. At dinner comes my Lord Carlingford
from London, going to Portsmouth: tells us that the Duchess of York
is brought to bed of a girl,--[Mary, afterwards Queen of England.]--at
which I find nobody pleased; and that Prince Rupert and the Duke of
Buckingham are sworn of the Privy Councell. He himself made a dish with
eggs of the butter of the Sparagus, which is very fine meat, which
I will practise hereafter. To horse again after dinner, and got to
Gilford, where after supper I to bed, having this day been offended by
Sir W. Pen’s foolish talk, and I offending him with my answers. Among
others he in discourse complaining of want of confidence, did ask me to
lend him a grain or two, which I told him I thought he was better stored
with than myself, before Sir George. So that I see I must keep a
greater distance than I have done, and I hope I may do it because of
the interest which I am making with Sir George. To bed all alone, and my
Will in the truckle bed.

     [According to the original Statutes of Corpus Christi Coll. Oxon,
     a Scholar slept in a truckle bed below each Fellow.  Called also
     “a trindle bed.”  Compare Hall’s description of an obsequious tutor:

                              “He lieth in a truckle bed
                    While his young master lieth o’er his head.”

                                                  Satires, ii.  6, 5.

     The bed was drawn in the daytime under the high bed of the tutor.
