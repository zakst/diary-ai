9th. Up betimes, and to my business at the office, where all the
morning. At noon comes Mrs. The. Turner, and dines with us, and my
wifeâ€™s painting-master staid and dined; and I take great pleasure in
thinking that my wife will really come to something in that business.
Here dined also Luellin. So after dinner to my office, and there very
busy till almost midnight, and so home to supper and to bed. This day
we have newes of eight ships being taken by some of ours going into the
Texel, their two men of warr, that convoyed them, running in. They come
from about Ireland, round to the north.
