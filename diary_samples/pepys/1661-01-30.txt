30th (Fast day). The first time that this day hath been yet observed:
and Mr. Mills made a most excellent sermon, upon “Lord forgive us
our former iniquities;” speaking excellently of the justice of God in
punishing men for the sins of their ancestors. Home, and John Goods
comes, and after dinner I did pay him L30 for my Lady, and after that
Sir W. Pen and I into Moorfields and had a brave talk, it being a most
pleasant day, and besides much discourse did please ourselves to see
young Davis and Whitton, two of our clerks, going by us in the field,
who we observe to take much pleasure together, and I did most often
see them at play together. Back to the Old James in Bishopsgate Street,
where Sir W. Batten and Sir Wm. Rider met him about business of the
Trinity House. So I went home, and there understand that my mother is
come home well from Brampton, and had a letter from my brother John, a
very ingenious one, and he therein begs to have leave to come to town
at the Coronacion. Then to my Lady Batten’s; where my wife and she
are lately come back again from being abroad, and seeing of Cromwell,
Ireton, and Bradshaw hanged and buried at Tyburn. Then I home.

     [“Jan. 30th was kept as a very solemn day of fasting and prayer.
     This morning the carcases of Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw (which
     the day before had been brought from the Red Lion Inn, Holborn),
     were drawn upon a sledge to Tyburn, and then taken out of their
     coffins, and in their shrouds hanged by the neck, until the going
     down of the sun.  They were then cut down, their heads taken off,
     and their bodies buried in a grave made under the gallows.  The
     coffin in which was the body of Cromwell was a very rich thing, very
     full of gilded hinges and nails.”--Rugge’s Diurnal.]
