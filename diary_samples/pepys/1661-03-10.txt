10th (Lordâ€™s day). Heard Mr. Mills in the morning, a good sermon. Dined
at home on a poor Lenten dinner of coleworts and bacon. In the afternoon
again to church, and there heard one Castle, whom I knew of my year at
Cambridge. He made a dull sermon. After sermon came my uncle and aunt
Wight to see us, and we sat together a great while. Then to reading and
at night to bed.
