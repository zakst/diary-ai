14th (Tuesday). Up betimes by water to the Temple. In the way read
the Narrative about prizes; and so to Lord Crew’s bedside, and then to
Westminster, where I hear Pen is, and sent for by messenger last night.
Thence to Commissioners of Accounts and there examined, and so back to
Westminster Hall, where all the talk of committing all to the Tower, and
Creed and I to the Quaker’s, dined together. Thence to the House, where
rose about four o’clock; and, with much ado, Pen got to Thursday to
bring in his answer; so my Lord escapes to-day. Thence with Godage and
G. Montagu to G. Carteret’s, and there sat their dinner-time: and hear
myself, by many Parliament-men, mightily commended. Thence to a play,
“Love’s Cruelty,” and so to my Lord Crew’s, who glad of this day’s time
got, and so home, and there office, and then home to supper and to bed,
my eyes being the better upon leaving drinking at night. Water, 1s.
Porter, 6d. Water, 6d. Dinner, 3s. 6d. Play part, 2s. Oranges, 1s. Home
