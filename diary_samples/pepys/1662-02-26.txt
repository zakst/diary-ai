26th. Mr. Berkenshaw with me all the morning composing of musique to
“This cursed jealousy, what is it,” a song of Sir W. Davenant’s. After
dinner I went to my Bookseller’s, W. Joyce’s, and several other places
to pay my debts and do business, I being resolved to cast up my accounts
within a day or two, for I fear I have run out too far. In coming home
I met with a face I knew and challenged him, thinking it had been one of
the Theatre musicians, and did enquire for a song of him, but finding
it a mistake, and that it was a gentleman that comes sometimes to the
office, I was much ashamed, but made a pretty good excuse that I took
him for a gentleman of Gray’s Inn who sings well, and so parted. Home
for all night and set things in order and so to bed.
