21st. This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr. Williams, but he not within we
went to Mrs. Terry, a daughter of Mr. Whately’s, who lately offered a
proposal of her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we
discoursed about and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak
with her, and in the meantime went to Will. Joyce’s and to an alehouse,
and drank a good while together, he being very angry that his father
Fenner will give him and his brother no more for mourning than their
father did give him and my aunt at their mother’s death, and a very
troublesome fellow I still find him to be, that his company ever wearys
me. From thence about two o’clock to Mrs. Whately’s, but she being going
to dinner we went to Whitehall and there staid till past three, and
here I understand by Mr. Moore that my Lady Sandwich is brought to bed
yesterday of a young Lady, and is very well. So to Mrs. Whately’s again,
and there were well received, and she desirous to have the thing go
forward, only is afeard that her daughter is too young and portion
not big enough, but offers L200 down with her. The girl is very well
favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think will do very
well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield from her
husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and so am
I. Hence home to my father’s, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped with
the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.
