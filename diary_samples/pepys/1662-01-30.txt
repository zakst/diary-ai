30th. Fast-day for the murthering of the late King. I went to church,
and Mr. Mills made a good sermon upon David’s words, “Who can lay his
hands upon the Lord’s Anoynted and be guiltless?” So home and to dinner,
and employed all the afternoon in my chamber, setting things and papers
to rights, which pleased me very well, and I think I shall begin to take
pleasure in being at home and minding my business. I pray God I may, for
I find a great need thereof. At night to supper and to bed.
