25th. At home and the office all the morning. Walking in the garden to
give the gardener directions what to do this year (for I intend to have
the garden handsome), Sir W. Pen came to me, and did break a business
to me about removing his son from Oxford to Cambridge to some private
college. I proposed Magdalene, but cannot name a tutor at present; but I
shall think and write about it. Thence with him to the Trinity-house to
dinner; where Sir Richard Brown (one of the clerks of the Council, and
who is much concerned against Sir N. Crisp’s project of making a great
sasse

     [A kind of weir with flood-gate, or a navigable sluice.  This
     project is mentioned by Evelyn, January 16th, 1661-62, and Lysons’
     “Environs” vol. iv., p.  392.--B.]

in the King’s lands about Deptford, to be a wett-dock to hold 200 sail
of ships. But the ground, it seems, was long since given by the King
to Sir Richard) was, and after the Trinity-house men had done their
business, the master, Sir William Rider, came to bid us welcome; and so
to dinner, where good cheer and discourse, but I eat a little too much
beef, which made me sick, and so after dinner we went to the office,
and there in a garden I went in the dark and vomited, whereby I did
much ease my stomach. Thence to supper with my wife to Sir W. Pen’s, his
daughter being come home to-day, not being very well, and so while
we were at supper comes Mr. Moore with letters from my Lord Sandwich,
speaking of his lying still at Tangier, looking for the fleet; which, we
hope, is now in a good way thither. So home to write letters by the post
to-night, and then again to Sir W. Pen’s to cards, where very merry, and
so home and to bed.
