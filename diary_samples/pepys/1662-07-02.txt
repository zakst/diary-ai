2nd. Up while the chimes went four, and to put down my journal, and so
to my office, to read over such instructions as concern the officers of
the Yard; for I am much upon seeing into the miscarriages there. By and

Mr. Coventry, who sits in his boat expecting us, and so we down to
him at the Tower, and there took water all, and to Deptford (he in
our passage taking notice how much difference there is between the old
Captains for obedience and order, and the King’s new Captains, which

dead, for which, when by and by I saw him, he do trouble himself most

is one-third of their duties performed; but I perceive, to my great
content, Mr. Coventry will have things reformed. So Mr. Coventry to
London, and Pett and I to the Pay, where Sir Williams both were paying

them so peremptory, and at every word would, complain to my Lord, as if
they shall have such a command over my Lord. In the evening I went forth
and took a walk with Mr. Davis, and told him what had passed at his
office to-day, and did give him my advice, and so with the rest by barge
home and to bed
