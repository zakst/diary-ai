9th. Up and to the office to prepare business for the Board, Reeves
being gone and I having lent him upon one of the glasses. Here we sat,
but to little purpose, nobody coming at us but to ask for money, not
to offer us any goods. At noon home to dinner, and then to the office
again, being mightily pleased with a Virgin’s head that my wife is now
doing of. In the evening to Lumbard-streete about money, to enable me to
pay Sir G. Carteret’s L3000, which he hath lodged in my hands, in behalf
of his son and my Lady Jemimah, toward their portion, which, I thank
God, I am able to do at a minute’s warning. In my [way] I inquired, and
find Mrs. Rawlinson is dead of the sickness, and her mayde continues
mighty ill. He himself is got out of the house. I met also with Mr.
Evelyn in the streete, who tells me the sad condition at this very day
at Deptford for the plague, and more at Deale (within his precinct as
one of the Commissioners for sick and wounded seamen), that the towne
is almost quite depopulated. Thence back home again, and after some
business at my office, late, home to supper and to bed, I being sleepy
by my late want of rest, notwithstanding my endeavouring to get a nap of
an hour this afternoon after dinner. So home and to bed.
