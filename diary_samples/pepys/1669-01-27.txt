27th. Up, and with Sir John Minnes in his coach to White Hall, where
first we waited on the Lords of the Treasury about finishing the
Victualling Contract; and there also I was put to it to make good our
letter complaining against my Lord Anglesey’s failing us in the payment
of the moneys assigned us upon the Customs, where Mr. Fenn was, and I
know will tell my Lord; but it is no matter, I am over shy already, and
therefore must not fear. Then we up to a Committee of the Council
for the Navy, about a business of Sir D. Gawden’s relating to the
Victualling, and thence I by hackney to the Temple to the Auditor’s man,
and with him to a tavern to meet with another under-auditor to advise
about the clearing of my Lord Bellasses’ accounts without injuring
myself and perplexing my accounts, and so thence away to my cozen
Turner’s, where I find Roger Pepys come last night to town, and here
is his mistress, Mrs. Dickenson, and by and by comes in Mr. Turner, a
worthy, sober, serious man--I honour him mightily. And there we dined,
having but an ordinary dinner; and so, after dinner, she, and I, and
Roger, and his mistress, to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there
saw “The Five Hours’ Adventure,” which hath not been acted a good while
before, but once, and is a most excellent play, I must confess. My wife
and The. come after us, after they had been to buy some things abroad,
and so after the play done we to see them home, and then home ourselves,
and my wife to read to me, and so to supper and to bed.
