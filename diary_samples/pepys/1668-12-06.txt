6th (Lord’s day). Up, and with my wife to church; which pleases me
mightily, I being full of fear that she would never go to church again,
after she had declared to me that she was a Roman Catholique. But though
I do verily think she fears God, and is truly and sincerely righteous,
yet I do see she is not so strictly so a Catholique as not to go to
church with me, which pleases me mightily. Here Mills made a lazy
sermon, upon Moses’s meeknesse, and so home, and my wife and I alone to
dinner, and then she to read a little book concerning speech in general,
a translation late out of French; a most excellent piece as ever I read,
proving a soul in man, and all the ways and secrets by which nature
teaches speech in man, which do please me most infinitely to read. By
and by my wife to church, and I to my Office to complete my Journall for
the last three days, and so home to my chamber to settle some papers,
and so to spend the evening with my wife and W. Hewer talking over the
business of the Office, and particularly my own Office, how I will make
it, and it will become, in a little time, an Office of ease, and not
slavery, as it hath for so many years been. So to supper, and to bed.
