16th. Up, but not so early as I intend now, and to my office, where
doing business all the morning. At noon by desire I dined with Sir W.
Batten, who tells me that the House have voted the supply, intended for
the King, shall be by subsidy. After dinner with Sir J. Minnes to see
some pictures at Brewer’s, said to be of good hands, but I do not like
them. So I to the office and thence to Stacy’s, his Tar merchant, whose
servant with whom I agreed yesterday for some tar do by combination
with Bowyer and Hill fall from our agreement, which vexes us all at the
office, even Sir W. Batten, who was so earnest for it. So to the office,
where we sat all the afternoon till night, and then to Sir W. Pen, who
continues ill, and so to bed about 10 o’clock.
