4th. Up early, and Mr. Moore comes to me and tells me that Mr. Barnwell
is dead, which troubles me something, and the more for that I believe we
shall lose Mr. Shepley’s company. By and by Sir W. Batten and I by water
to Woolwich; and there saw an experiment made of Sir R. Ford’s Holland’s
yarn (about which we have lately had so much stir; and I have much
concerned myself for our ropemaker, Mr. Hughes, who has represented it
as bad), and we found it to be very bad, and broke sooner than, upon a
fair triall, five threads of that against four of Riga yarn; and also
that some of it had old stuff that had been tarred, covered over with
new hemp, which is such a cheat as hath not been heard of. I was glad of
this discovery, because I would not have the King’s workmen discouraged
(as Sir W. Batten do most basely do) from representing the faults of
merchants’ goods, where there is any. After eating some fish that we
had bought upon the water at Falconer’s, we went to Woolwich, and there
viewed our frames of our houses, and so home, and I to my Lord’s, who I
find resolved to buy Brampton Manor of Sir Peter Ball,

     [Sir Peter Ball was the Queen’s Attorney-General, and Evelyn
     mentions, in his Diary (January 11th, 1661-62), having received from
     him the draft of an act against the nuisance of the smoke of
     London.]

at which I am glad. Thence to White Hall, and showed Sir G. Carteret the
cheat, and so to the Wardrobe, and there staid and supped with my Lady.
My Lord eating nothing, but writes letters to-night to several places,
he being to go out of town to-morrow. So late home and to bed.
