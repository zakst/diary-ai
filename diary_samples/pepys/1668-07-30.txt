30th. Up, and by water to White Hall. There met with Mr. May, who was
giving directions about making a close way for people to go dry from the
gate up into the House, to prevent their going through the galleries;
which will be very good. I staid and talked with him about the state of
the Kingâ€™s Offices in general, and how ill he is served, and do still
find him an excellent person, and so back to the office. So close at my
office all the afternoon till evening, and then out with my wife to the
New Exchange, and so back again.
