5th. At the office till almost noon, and then broke up. Then came Sir
G. Carteret, and he and I walked together alone in the garden, taking
notice of some faults in the office, particularly of Sir W. Battenâ€™s,
and he seemed to be much pleased with me, and I hope will be the ground
of a future interest of mine in him, which I shall be glad of. Then
with my wife abroad, she to the Wardrobe and there dined, and I to the
Exchange and so to the Wardrobe, but they had dined. After dinner my
wife and the two ladies to see my aunt Wight, and thence met me at home.
From thence (after Sir W. Batten and I had viewed our houses with a
workman in order to the raising of our roofs higher to enlarge our
houses) I went with them by coach first to Moorfields and there walked,
and thence to Islington and had a fine walk in the fields there, and so,
after eating and drinking, home with them, and so by water with my wife
home, and after supper to bed.
