6th (Twelfth day). Up, and to look after things against dinner to-day
for my guests, and then to the Office to write down my journall for five
or six days backward, and so home to look after dinner, it being now
almost noon. At noon comes Mrs. Turner and Dyke, and Mrs. Dickenson, and
then comes The. and Betty Turner, the latter of which is a very pretty
girl; and then Creed and his wife, whom I sent for, by my coach. These
were my guests, and Mrs. Turnerâ€™s friend, whom I saw the other day,
Mr. Wicken, and very merry we were at dinner, and so all the afternoon,
talking, and looking up and down my house; and in the evening I did
bring out my cake--a noble cake, and there cut it into pieces, with wine
and good drink: and after a new fashion, to prevent spoiling the cake,
did put so many titles into a hat, and so drew cuts; and I was the
Queene; and The. Turner, King--Creed, Sir Martin Marr-all; and Betty,
Mrs. Millicent: and so we were mighty merry till it was night; and then,
being moonshine and fine frost, they went home, I lending some of them
my coach to help to carry them, and so my wife and I spent the rest of
the evening in talk and reading, and so with great pleasure to bed.
