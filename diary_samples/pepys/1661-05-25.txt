25th. All the morning at home about business. At noon to the Temple,
where I staid and looked over a book or two at Playford’s, and then to
the Theatre, where I saw a piece of “The Silent Woman,” which pleased
me. So homewards, and in my way bought “The Bondman” in Paul’s
Churchyard, and so home, where I found all clean, and the hearth and
range, as it is now enlarged, set up, which pleases me very much.
