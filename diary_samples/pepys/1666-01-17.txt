17th. Busy all the morning, settling things against my going out
of towne this night. After dinner, late took horse, having sent for
Lashmore to go with me, and so he and I rode to Dagenhams in the dark.
There find the whole family well. It was my Lord Crew’s desire that
I should come, and chiefly to discourse with me of Lord Sandwich’s
matters; and therein to persuade, what I had done already, that my Lord
should sue out a pardon for his business of the prizes, as also for
Bergen, and all he hath done this year past, before he begins his
Embassy to Spayne. For it is to be feared that the Parliament will fly
out against him and particular men, the next Session. He is glad also
that my Lord is clear of his sea-imployment, though sorry as I am, only
in the manner of its bringing about. By and by to supper, my Lady Wright
very kind. After supper up to wait on my Lady Crew, who is the same
weake silly lady as ever, asking such saintly questions. Down to my Lord
again and sat talking an houre or two, and anon to prayers the whole
family, and then all to bed, I handsomely used, lying in the chamber
Mr. Carteret formerly did, but sat up an houre talking sillily with Mr.
Carteret and Mr. Marre, and so to bed.
