22nd. At the office all the morning. At noon Sir Williams both and I by
water down to the Lewes, Captain Dekins, his ship, a merchantman, where
we met the owners, Sir John Lewes and Alderman Lewes, and several
other great merchants; among others one Jefferys, a merry man that is a
fumbler, and he and I called brothers, and he made all the mirth in the
company. We had a very fine dinner, and all our wivesâ€™ healths, with
seven or nine guns apiece; and exceeding merry we were, and so home by
barge again, and I vexed to find Griffin leave the office door open, and
had a design to have carried away the screw or the carpet in revenge to
him, but at last I would not, but sent for him and chid him, and so to
supper and to bed, having drank a great deal of wine.
