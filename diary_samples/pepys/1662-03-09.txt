9th (Lord’s day). Church in the morning: dined at home, then to Church
again and heard Mr. Naylor, whom I knew formerly of Keye’s College, make
a most eloquent sermon. Thence to Sir W. Batten’s to see how he did,
then to walk an hour with Sir W. Pen in the garden: then he in to supper
with me at my house, and so to prayers and to bed.
