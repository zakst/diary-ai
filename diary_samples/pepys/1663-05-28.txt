28th. Up this morning, and my wife, I know not for what cause, being
against going to Chelsey to-day, it being a holy day (Ascension Day) and
I at leisure, it being the first holy day almost that we have observed
ever since we came to the office, we did give Ashwell leave to go by
herself, and I out to several places about business. Among others to
Dr. Williams, to reckon with him for physique that my wife has had for
a year or two, coming to almost L4. Then to the Exchange, where I hear
that the King had letters yesterday from France that the King there is
in a [way] of living again, which I am glad to hear. At the coffee-house
in Exchange Alley I bought a little book, “Counsell to Builders,” by
Sir Balth. Gerbier. It is dedicated almost to all the men of any great
condition in England, so that the Epistles are more than the book
itself, and both it and them not worth a turd, that I am ashamed that
I bought it. Home and there found Creed, who dined with us, and after
dinner by water to the Royall Theatre; but that was so full they told
us we could have no room. And so to the Duke’s House; and there
saw “Hamlett” done, giving us fresh reason never to think enough of
Betterton. Who should we see come upon the stage but Gosnell, my wife’s
maid? but neither spoke, danced, nor sung; which I was sorry for. But
she becomes the stage very well. Thence by water home, after we had
walked to and fro, backwards and forwards, six or seven times in the
Temple walks, disputing whether to go by land or water. By land home,
and thence by water to Halfway House, and there eat some supper we
carried with us, and so walked home again, it being late we were forced
to land at the dock, my wife and they, but I in a humour not willing to
daub my shoes went round by the Custom House. So home, and by and by to
bed, Creed lying with me in the red chamber all night.
