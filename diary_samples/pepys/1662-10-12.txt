12th (Lord’s day). Made myself fine with Captain Ferrers’s lace band,
being lothe to wear my own new scallop, it is so fine; and, after the
barber had done with us, to church, where I saw most of the gentry of
the parish; among others, Mrs. Hanbury, a proper lady, and Mr. Bernard
and his Lady, with her father, my late Lord St. John, who looks now like
a very plain grave man. Mr. Wells preached a pretty good sermon, and
they say he is pretty well in his witts again. So home to dinner, and
so to walk in the garden, and then to Church again, and so home, there
coming several people about business, and among others Mr. Piggott, who
gives me good assurance of his truth to me and our business, in which I
am very much pleased, and tells me what my uncle Thomas said to him and
what he designs, which (in fine) is to be admitted to the estate as well
as we, which I must endeavour to oppose as well as I can. So to supper,
but my mind is so full of our business that I am no company at all, and
then their drink do not please me, till I did send to Goody Stanks for
some of her’s which is very small and fresh, with a little taste of
wormewood, which ever after did please me very well. So after supper to
bed, thinking of business, but every night getting my brother John to go
up with me for discourse sake, while I was making unready.

     [That is, “undressing.”  So of the French lords leaping over the
     walls in their shirts

         “Alenc.  How now, my lords!  what all unready so?
          Bast.  Unready!  ay, and glad we ‘scaped so well.”
