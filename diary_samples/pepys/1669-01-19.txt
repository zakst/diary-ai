19th. Up, and at the office all the morning. At noon eat a mouthful, and
so with my wife to Madam Turner’s, and find her gone, but The. staid for
us; and so to the King’s house, to see “Horace;” this the third day
of its acting--a silly tragedy; but Lacy hath made a farce of several
dances--between each act, one: but his words are but silly, and
invention not extraordinary, as to the dances; only some Dutchmen come
out of the mouth and tail of a Hamburgh sow. Thence, not much pleased
with the play, set them at home in the Strand; and my wife and I home,
and there to do a little business at the Office, and so home to supper
and to bed.
