3rd. Up among my workmen, my head akeing all day from last night’s
debauch. To the office all the morning, and at noon dined with Sir W.
Batten and Pen, who would needs have me drink two drafts of sack to-day
to cure me of last night’s disease, which I thought strange but I think
find it true.

     [The proverb, “A hair of the dog that bit you,” which probably had
     originally a literal meaning, has long been used to inculcate the
     advice of the two Sir Williams.]

Then home with my workmen all the afternoon, at night into the garden to
play on my flageolette, it being moonshine, where I staid a good while,
and so home and to bed. This day I hear that the Dutch have sent the
King a great present of money, which we think will stop the match with
Portugal; and judge this to be the reason that our so great haste in
sending the two ships to the East Indys is also stayed.
