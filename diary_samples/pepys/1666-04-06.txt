6th. Up mighty betimes upon my wife’s going this day toward Brampton. I
could not go to the coach with her, but W. Hewer did and hath leave from
me to go the whole day’s journey with her. All the morning upon business
at the office, and at noon dined, and Mrs. Hunt coming lent her L5 on
her occasions and so carried her to Axe Yard end at Westminster and
there left her, a good and understanding woman, and her husband I
perceive thrives mightily in his business of the Excise. Thence to Mr.
Hales and there sat, and my picture almost finished, which by the word
of Mr. and Mrs. Pierce (who come in accidently) is mighty like, and I
am sure I am mightily pleased both in the thing and the posture. Thence
with them home a little, and so to White Hall and there met by agreement
with Sir Stephen Fox and Mr. Ashburnham, and discoursed the business
of our Excise tallys; the former being Treasurer of the guards, and
the other Cofferer of the King’s household. I benefitted much by their
discourse. We come to no great conclusion upon our discourse, but
parted, and I home, where all things, methinks, melancholy in the
absence of my wife. This day great newes of the Swedes declaring for
us against the Dutch, and, so far as that, I believe it. After a little
supper to bed.
