12th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen to St. James’s by water,
and there did our usual business with the Duke of Yorke. Thence I to
Westminster, and there, spoke with Michell and Howlett, who tell me how
their poor young ones are going to Shadwell’s. The latter told me of the
unkindness of the young man to his wife, which is now over, and I have
promised to appear a counsellor to him. I am glad she is like to be so
near us again. Thence to Martin, and there did ‘tout ce que je voudrais
avec’ her, and drank, and away by water home and to dinner, Balty and
his wife there. After dinner I took him down with me to Deptford, and
there by the Bezan loaded above half my goods and sent them away. So
we back home, and then I found occasion to return in the dark and to
Bagwell, and there... did do all that I desired, but though I did intend
‘pour avoir demeurais con elle’ to-day last night, yet when I had
done ‘ce que je voudrais I did hate both elle and la cose’, and taking
occasion from the occasion of ‘su marido’s return... did me lever’,
and so away home late to Sir W. Pen’s (Batty and his wife lying at my
house), and there in the same simple humour I found Sir W. Pen, and so
late to bed.
