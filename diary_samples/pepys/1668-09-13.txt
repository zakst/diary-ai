13th (Lord’s day). The like all this morning and afternoon, and finished
it to my mind. So about four o’clock walked to the Temple, and there
by coach to St. James’s, and met, to my wish, the Duke of York and
Mr. Wren; and understand the Duke of York hath received answers from
Brouncker, W. Pen, and J. Minnes; and as soon as he saw me, he bid Mr.
Wren read them over with me. So having no opportunity of talk with the
Duke of York, and Mr. Wren some business to do, he put them into my
hands like an idle companion, to, take home with me before himself had
read them, which do give me great opportunity of altering my answer, if
there was cause. So took a hackney and home, and after supper made my
wife to read them all over, wherein she is mighty useful to me; and I
find them all evasions, and in many things false, and in few, to the
full purpose. Little said reflective on me, though W. Pen and J. Minnes
do mean me in one or two places, and J. Minnes a little more plainly
would lead the Duke of York to question the exactness of my keeping my
records; but all to no purpose. My mind is mightily pleased by this, if
I can but get time to have a copy taken of them, for my future use; but
I must return them tomorrow. So to bed.
