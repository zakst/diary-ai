Home, and fell a-reading of the tryalls of the late men that were hanged
for the King’s death, and found good satisfaction in reading thereof. At
night to bed, and my wife and I did fall out about the dog’s being put
down into the cellar, which I had a mind to have done because of his
fouling the house, and I would have my will, and so we went to bed and
lay all night in a quarrel. This night I was troubled all night with a
dream that my wife was dead, which made me that I slept ill all night.
