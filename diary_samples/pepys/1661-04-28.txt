28th (Lord’s day). In the morning to my father’s, where I dined, and in
the afternoon to their church, where come Mrs. Turner and Mrs. Edward
Pepys, and several other ladies, and so I went out of the pew into
another. And after sermon home with them, and there staid a while and
talked with them and was sent for to my father’s, where my cozen Angier
and his wife, of Cambridge, to whom I went, and was glad to see them,
and sent for wine for them, and they supped with my father. After supper
my father told me of an odd passage the other night in bed between my
mother and him, and she would not let him come to bed to her out of
jealousy of him and an ugly wench that lived there lately, the most
ill-favoured slut that ever I saw in my life, which I was ashamed to
hear that my mother should be become such a fool, and my father bid me
to take notice of it to my mother, and to make peace between him and
her. All which do trouble me very much. So to bed to my wife.
