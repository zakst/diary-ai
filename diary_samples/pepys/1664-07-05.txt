5th. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the ‘Change
a little, then with W. Howe home and dined. So after dinner to my
office, and there busy till late at night, having had among other things
much discourse with young Gregory about the Chest business, wherein Sir
W. Batten is so great a knave, and also with Alsop and Lanyon about the
Tangier victualling, wherein I hope to get something for myself. Late
home to supper and to bed, being full of thoughts of a sudden resolution
this day taken upon the ‘Change of going down to-morrow to the Hope.
