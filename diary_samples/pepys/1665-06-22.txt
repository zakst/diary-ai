22nd. Up pretty betimes, and in great pain whether to send my another
into the country to-day or no, I hearing, by my people, that she, poor
wretch, hath a mind to stay a little longer, and I cannot blame her,
considering what a life she will through her own folly lead when she
comes home again, unlike the pleasure and liberty she hath had here. At
last I resolved to put it to her, and she agreed to go, so I would not
oppose it, because of the sicknesse in the towne, and my intentions of
removing my wife. So I did give her money and took a kind leave of her,
she, poor wretch, desiring that I would forgive my brother John, but I
refused it to her, which troubled her, poor soul, but I did it in kind
words and so let the discourse go off, she leaving me though in a great
deal of sorrow. So I to my office and left my wife and people to see her
out of town, and I at the office all the morning. At noon my wife tells
me that she is with much ado gone, and I pray God bless her, but it
seems she was to the last unwilling to go, but would not say so, but put
it off till she lost her place in the coach, and was fain to ride in the
waggon part. After dinner to the office again till night, very busy, and
so home not very late to supper and to bed.
