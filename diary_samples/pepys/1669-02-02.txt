2nd. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and home to dinner
at noon, where I find Mr. Sheres; and there made a short dinner, and
carried him with us to the King’s playhouse, where “The Heyresse,”
 not-withstanding Kinaston’s being beaten, is acted; and they say the
King is very angry with Sir Charles Sedley for his being beaten, but he
do deny it. But his part is done by Beeston, who is fain to read it out
of a book all the while, and thereby spoils the part, and almost the
play, it being one of the best parts in it; and though the design is,
in the first conception of it, pretty good, yet it is but an indifferent
play, wrote, they say, by my Lord Newcastle. But it was pleasant to
see Beeston come in with others, supposing it to be dark, and yet he
is forced to read his part by the light of the candles: and this
I observing to a gentleman that sat by me, he was mightily pleased
therewith, and spread it up and down. But that, that pleased me most in
the play is, the first song that Knepp sings, she singing three or four;
and, indeed, it was very finely sung, so as to make the whole house clap
her. Thence carried Sheres to White Hall, and there I stepped in, and
looked out Mr. May, who tells me that he and his company cannot come to
dine with me to-morrow, whom I expected only to come to see the manner
of our Office and books, at which I was not very much displeased, having
much business at the Office, and so away home, and there to the office
about my letters, and then home to supper and to bed, my wife being in
mighty ill humour all night, and in the morning I found it to be from
her observing Knepp to wink and smile on me; and she says I smiled on
her; and, poor wretch! I did perceive that she did, and do on all such
occasions, mind my eyes. I did, with much difficulty, pacify her, and
were friends, she desiring that hereafter, at that house, we might
always sit either above in a box, or, if there be [no] room, close up to
the lower boxes.
