25th (Christmas day). Lay pretty long in bed, and then rose, leaving my
wife desirous to sleep, having sat up till four this morning seeing her
mayds make mince-pies. I to church, where our parson Mills made a good
sermon. Then home, and dined well on some good ribbs of beef roasted and
mince pies; only my wife, brother, and Barker, and plenty of good wine
of my owne, and my heart full of true joy; and thanks to God Almighty
for the goodness of my condition at this day. After dinner, I begun
to teach my wife and Barker my song, “It is decreed,” which pleases me
mightily as now I have Mr. Hinxton’s base. Then out and walked alone on
foot to the Temple, it being a fine frost, thinking to have seen a play
all alone; but there, missing of any bills, concluded there was none,
and so back home; and there with my brother reducing the names of all
my books to an alphabet, which kept us till 7 or 8 at night, and then
to supper, W. Hewer with us, and pretty merry, and then to my chamber
to enter this day’s journal only, and then to bed. My head a little
thoughtfull how to behave myself in the business of the victualling,
which I think will be prudence to offer my service in doing something in
passing the pursers’ accounts, thereby to serve the King, get honour to
myself, and confirm me in my place in the victualling, which at present
yields not work enough to deserve my wages.
