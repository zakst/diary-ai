25th. Took physique betimes and to sleep, then up, it working all the
morning. At noon dined, and in the afternoon in my chamber spending
two or three hours to look over some unpleasant letters and things of
trouble to answer my father in, about Tom’s business and others, that
vexed me, but I did go through it and by that means eased my mind very
much. This afternoon also came Tom and Charles Pepys by my sending for,
and received of me L40 in part towards their L70 legacy of my uncle’s.
Spent the evening talking with my wife, and so to bed.
