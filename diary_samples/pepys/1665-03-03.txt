3rd. Up, and abroad about several things, among others to see Mr. Peter
Honiwood, who was at my house the other day, and I find it was for
nothing but to pay me my brother John’s Quarterage. Thence to see Mrs.
Turner, who takes it mighty ill I did not come to dine with the Reader,
her husband, which, she says, was the greatest feast that ever was yet
kept by a Reader, and I believe it was well. But I am glad I did not go,
which confirms her in an opinion that I am growne proud. Thence to the
‘Change, and to several places, and so home to dinner and to my office,
where till 12 at night writing over a discourse of mine to Mr. Coventry
touching the Fishermen of the Thames upon a reference of the business
by him to me concerning their being protected from presse. Then home to
supper and to bed.
