14th (Office day). But this day was the first that we do begin to sit
in the afternoon, and not in the forenoon, and therefore I went into
Cheapside to Mr. Beauchamp’s, the goldsmith, to look out a piece of
plate to give Mr. Fox from my Lord, for his favour about the L4,000,
and did choose a gilt tankard. So to Paul’s Churchyard and bought
“Cornelianum dolium:”

     [“Cornelianum dolium” is a Latin comedy, by T. R., published at
     London in 1638.  Douce attributed it to Thomas Randolph (d. 1635).
     The book has a frontispiece representing the sweating tub which,
     from the name of the patient, was styled Cornelius’s tub.  There is
     a description of the play in the “European Magazine,” vol. xxxvii.
     (1805), p. 343]

So home to dinner, and after that to the office till late at night, and
so Sir W. Pen, the Comptroller, and I to the Dolphin, where we found Sir
W. Batten, who is seldom a night from hence, and there we did drink
a great quantity of sack and did tell many merry stories, and in good
humours we were all. So home and to bed.
