500, become their prisoners.  ‘Tis said, too, that eighteen Dutch
     men-of-war are passed the Channell, in order to meet with our Smyrna
     ships; and some, I hear, do fright us with the King of Sweden’s
     seizing our mast-ships at Gottenburgh.  But we have too much ill
     newes true, to afflict ourselves with what is uncertain.  That which
     I hear from Scotland is, the Duke of York’s saying, yesterday, that
     he is confident the Lieutenant-Generall there hath driven them into
     a pound, somewhere towards the mountains.”

Having writ my letter, I home to supper and to bed, the world being
mightily troubled at the ill news from Barbadoes, and the consequence of
the Scotch business, as little as we do make of it. And to shew how mad
we are at home, here, and unfit for any troubles: my Lord St. John did,
a day or two since, openly pull a gentleman in Westminster Hall by the
nose, one Sir Andrew Henly, while the judges were upon their benches,
and the other gentleman did give him a rap over the pate with his cane,
of which fray the judges, they say, will make a great matter: men are
only sorry the gentle man did proceed to return a blow; for, otherwise,
my Lord would have been soundly fined for the affront, and may be yet
for his affront to the judges.
