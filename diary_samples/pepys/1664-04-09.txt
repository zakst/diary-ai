9th. The last night, whether it was from cold I got to-day upon the
water I know not, or whether it was from my mind being over concerned
with Stanes’s business of the platery of the navy, for my minds was
mighty troubled with the business all night long, I did wake about one
o’clock in the morning, a thing I most rarely do, and pissed a little
with great pain, continued sleepy, but in a high fever all night, fiery
hot, and in some pain. Towards morning I slept a little and waking
found myself better, but.... with some pain, and rose I confess with my
clothes sweating, and it was somewhat cold too, which I believe might do
me more hurt, for I continued cold and apt to shake all the morning, but
that some trouble with Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten kept me warm. At
noon home to dinner upon tripes, and so though not well abroad with my
wife by coach to her Tailor’s and the New Exchange, and thence to my
father’s and spoke one word with him, and thence home, where I found
myself sick in my stomach and vomited, which I do not use to do. Then
I drank a glass or two of Hypocras, and to the office to dispatch
some business, necessary, and so home and to bed, and by the help of
Mithrydate slept very well.
