17th. Up and walked to Mr. Povy’s by appointment, where I found him and
Creed busy about fitting things for the Committee, and thence we to my
Lord Ashly’s, where to see how simply, beyond all patience, Povy did
again, by his many words and no understanding, confound himself and his
business, to his disgrace, and rendering every body doubtfull of his
being either a foole or knave, is very wonderfull. We broke up all
dissatisfied, and referred the business to a meeting of Mr. Sherwin
and others to settle, but here it was mighty strange methought to find
myself sit herein Committee with my hat on, while Mr. Sherwin stood bare
as a clerke, with his hat off to his Lord Ashlyand the rest, but I thank
God I think myself never a whit the better man for all that. Thence
with Creed to the ‘Change and Coffee-house, and so home, where a brave
dinner, by having a brace of pheasants and very merry about Povy’s
folly. So anon to the office, and there sitting very late, and then
after a little time at Sir W. Batten’s, where I am mighty great and
could if I thought it fit continue so, I to the office again, and there
very late, and so home to the sorting of some of my books, and so to
bed, the weather becoming pretty warm, and I think and hope the frost
will break.
