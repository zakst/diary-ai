3rd. Up, being well pleased with my new lodging and the convenience of
having our mayds and none else about us, Will lying below. So to the
office, and there we sat full of business all the morning. At noon I
home to dinner, and then abroad to buy a bell to hang by our chamber
door to call the mayds. Then to the office, and met Mr. Blackburne, who
came to know the reason of his kinsman (my Will) his being observed
by his friends of late to droop much. I told him my great displeasure
against him and the reasons of it, to his great trouble yet
satisfaction, for my care over him, and how every thing I said was for
the good of the fellow, and he will take time to examine the fellow
about all, and to desire my pleasure concerning him, which I told him
was either that he should became a better servant or that we would not
have him under my roof to be a trouble. He tells me in a few days he
will come to me again and we shall agree what to do therein. I home and
told my wife all, and am troubled to see that my servants and others
should be the greatest trouble I have in the world, more than for
myself. We then to set up our bell with a smith very well, and then I
late at the office. So home to supper and to bed.
