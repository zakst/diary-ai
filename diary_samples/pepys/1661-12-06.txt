6th. Lay long in bed, and then to Westminster Hall and there walked, and
then with Mr. Spicer, Hawly, Washington, and little Mr. Ashwell (my old
friends at the Exchequer) to the Dog, and gave them two or three quarts
of wine, and so away to White Hall, where, at Sir G. Carteret’s,
Sir Williams both and I dined very pleasantly; and after dinner, by
appointment, came the Governors of the East India Company, to sign and
seal the contract between us

     [Charles II.’s charter to the Company, confirming and extending the
     former charter, is dated April 3rd, 1661.  Bombay, just acquired as
     part of Queen Katherine’s dowry, was made over to the Company by
     Letters Patent dated March 27th, 1669.]

(in the King’s name) and them. And that done, we all went to the King’s
closet, and there spoke with the King and the Duke of York, who promise
to be very careful of the India trade to the utmost. So back to Sir G.
Carteret’s and ended our business, and so away homewards, but Sir W.
Batten offering to go to the 3 Tuns at Charing Cross, where the pretty
maid the daughter of the house is; I was saying that, that tickled Sir
W. Pen, he seemed to take these words very captiously and angrily, which
I saw, and seemed indifferent to go home in his coach with them, and
so took leave to go to the Council Chamber to speak with my Lord Privy
Seal, which I did, but they did stay for me, which I was pleased at, but
no words passed between him and me in all our way home. So home and to
bed.
