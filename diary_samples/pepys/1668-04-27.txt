27th. Up, and Captain Deane come to see me, and he and I toward
Westminster together, and I set him down at White Hall, while I to
Westminster Hall, and up to the Lords’ House, and there saw Sir W. Pen
go into the House of Lords, where his impeachment was read to him,
and he used mighty civilly, the Duke of York being there; and two days
hence, at his desire, he is to bring in his answer, and a day then to be
appointed for his being heard with Counsel. Thence down into the Hall,
and with Creed and Godolphin walked; and do hear that to-morrow is
appointed, upon a motion on Friday last, to discourse the business of my
Lord Sandwich, moved by Sir R. Howard, that he should be sent for, home;
and I fear it will be ordered. Certain news come, I hear, this day, that
the Spanish Plenipotentiary in Flanders will not agree to the peace and
terms we and the Dutch have made for him and the King of France; and by
this means the face of things may be altered, and we forced to join with
the French against Spain, which will be an odd thing. At noon with Creed
to my Lord Crew’s, and there dined; and here was a very fine-skinned
lady dined, the daughter of my Lord Roberts, and also a fine lady, Mr.
John Parkhurst his wife, that was but a boy the other day. And after
dinner there comes in my Lady Roberts herself, and with her Mr.
Roberts’s daughter, that was Mrs. Boddevill, the great beauty, and
a fine lady indeed, the first time I saw her. My Lord Crew, and
Sir Thomas, and I, and Creed, all the afternoon debating of my Lord
Sandwich’s business, against to-morrow, and thence I to the King’s
playhouse, and there saw most of “The Cardinall,” a good play, and
thence to several places to pay my debts, and then home, and there took
a coach and to Mile End to take a little ayre, and thence home to Sir
W. Pen’s, where I supped, and sat all the evening; and being lighted
homeward by Mrs. Markham, I blew out the candle and kissed her, and so
home to bed.
