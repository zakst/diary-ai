13th. Up, and to the Tower, to see Sir W. Coventry, and with him talking
of business of the Navy, all alone, an hour, he taking physic. And so
away to the Office, where all the morning, and then home to dinner, with
my people, and so to the Office again, and there all the afternoon till
night, when comes, by mistake, my cozen Turner, and her two daughters,
which love such freaks, to eat some anchovies and ham of bacon with me,
instead of noon, at dinner, when I expected them. But, however, I had
done my business before they come, and so was in good humour enough to
be with them, and so home to them to supper, and pretty merry, being
pleased to see Betty Turner, which hath something mighty pretty. But
that which put me in good humour, both at noon and night, is the fancy
that I am this day made a Captain of one of the King’s ships, Mr. Wren
having this day sent me, the Duke of York’s commission to be Captain of
“The Jerzy,” in order to my being of a Court-martiall for examining the
loss of “The Defyance,” and other things; which do give me occasion of
much mirth, and may be of some use to me, at least I shall get a little
money by it for the time I have it; it being designed that I must really
be a Captain to be able to sit in this Court. They staid till about
eight at night, and then away, and my wife to read to me, and then to
bed in mighty good humour, but for my eyes.
