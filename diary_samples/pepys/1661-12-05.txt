5th. This morning I went early to the Paynter’s and there sat for my
picture the fourth time, but it do not yet please me, which do much
trouble me. Thence to the Treasury Office, where I found Sir W. Batten
come before me, and there we sat to pay off the St. George. By and by
came Sir W. Pen, and he and I staid while Sir W. Batten went home to
dinner, and then he came again, and Sir W. Pen and I went and dined
at my house, and had two mince pies sent thither by our order from the
messenger Slater, that had dressed some victuals for us, and so we were
very merry, and after dinner rode out in his coach, he to Whitehall, and
my wife and I to the Opera, and saw “Hamlett” well performed. Thence to
the Temple and Mrs. Turner’s (who continues still very ill), and so home
and to bed.
