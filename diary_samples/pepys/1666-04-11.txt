11th. To White Hall, having first set my people to worke about setting
me rails upon the leads of my wife’s closett, a thing I have long
designed, but never had a fit opportunity till now. After having done
with the Duke of Yorke, I to Hales’s, where there was nothing found
to be done more to my picture, but the musique, which now pleases
me mightily, it being painted true. Thence home, and after dinner to
Gresham College, where a great deal of do and formality in choosing of
the Council and Officers. I had three votes to be of the Council, who
am but a stranger, nor expected any. So my Lord Bruncker being confirmed
President I home, where I find to my great content my rails up upon my
leads. To the office and did a little business, and then home and did
a great jobb at my Tangier accounts, which I find are mighty apt to
run into confusion, my head also being too full of other businesses and
pleasures. This noon Bagwell’s wife come to me to the office, after her
being long at Portsmouth. After supper, and past 12 at night to bed.
