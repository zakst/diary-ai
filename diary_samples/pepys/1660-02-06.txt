6th. Before I went to my office I went to Mr. Crew’s and paid Mr.
Andrews the same L60 that he had received of Mr. Calthrop the last week.
So back to Westminster and walked with him thither, where we found the
soldiers all set in the Palace Yard, to make way for General Monk to
come to the House. At the Hall we parted, and meeting Swan, he and I to
the Swan and drank our morning draft. So back again to the Hall, where
I stood upon the steps and saw Monk go by, he making observance to the
judges as he went along. At noon my father dined with me upon my turkey
that was brought from Denmark, and after dinner he and I to the Bull
Head Tavern, where we drank half a pint of wine and so parted. I to Mrs.
Ann, and Mrs. Jem being gone out of the chamber she and I had a very
high bout, I rattled her up, she being in her bed, but she becoming more
cool, we parted pretty good friends. Thence I went to Will’s, where I
staid at cards till 10 o’clock, losing half a crown, and so home to bed.
