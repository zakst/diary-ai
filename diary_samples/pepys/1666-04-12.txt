12th. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon dined at home
and so to my office again, and taking a turne in the garden my Lady Pen
comes to me and takes me into her house, where I find her daughter and a
pretty lady of her acquaintance, one Mrs. Lowder, sister, I suppose, of
her servant Lowderâ€™s, with whom I, notwithstanding all my resolution to
follow business close this afternoon, did stay talking and playing the
foole almost all the afternoon, and there saw two or three foolish sorry
pictures of her doing, but very ridiculous compared to what my wife do.
She grows mighty homely and looks old. Thence ashamed at myself for this
losse of time, yet not able to leave it, I to the office, where my Lord
Bruncker come; and he and I had a little fray, he being, I find, a very
peevish man, if he be denied what he expects, and very simple in his
argument in this business (about signing a warrant for paying Sir Thos.
Allen L1000 out of the groats); but we were pretty good friends before
we parted, and so we broke up and I to the writing my letters by the
post, and so home to supper and to bed.
