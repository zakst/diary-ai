2d (Lord’s day). My head not very well, and my body out of order by last
night’s drinking, which is my great folly. To church, and Mr. Mills made
a good sermon; so home to dinner. My wife and I all alone to a leg of
mutton, the sawce of which being made sweet, I was angry at it, and eat
none, but only dined upon the marrow bone that we had beside. To church
in the afternoon, and after sermon took Tom Fuller’s Church History and
read over Henry the 8th’s life in it, and so to supper and to bed.
