October 11th (Lord’s day’). Up and to church, where I find Parson Mills
come to town and preached, and the church full, most people being now
come home to town, though the season of year is as good as summer in all
respects. At noon dined at home with my wife, all alone, and busy all
the afternoon in my closet, making up some papers with W. Hewer and at
night comes Mr. Turner and his wife, and there they tell me that Mr.
Harper is dead at Deptford, and so now all his and my care is, how
to secure his being Storekeeper in his stead; and here they and their
daughter, and a kinswoman that come along with them, did sup with me,
and pretty merry, and then, they gone, and my wife to read to me, and to
bed.
