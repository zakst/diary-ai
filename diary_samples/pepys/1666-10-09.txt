9th. Up and to the office, where we sat the first day since the fire,
I think. At noon home, and my uncle Thomas was there, and dined with my
brother and I (my father and I were gone abroad), and then to the office
again in the afternoon, and there close all day long, and did much
business. At night to Sir W. Batten, where Sir R. Ford did occasion some
discourse of sending a convoy to the Maderas; and this did put us
upon some new thoughts of sending our privateer thither on merchantsâ€™
accounts, which I have more mind to, the profit being certain and
occasion honest withall. So home, and to supper with my father, and then
to set my remainder of my books gilt in order with much pleasure, and so
late to bed.
