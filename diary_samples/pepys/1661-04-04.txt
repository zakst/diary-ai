4th. To my workmen, then to my Lord’s, and there dined with Mr. Shepley.
After dinner I went in to my Lord and there we had a great deal of
musique, and then came my cozen Tom Pepys and there did accept of the
security which we gave him for his L1000 that we borrow of him, and so
the money to be paid next week. Then to the Privy Seal, and so with Mr.
Moore to my father’s, where some friends did sup there and we with them
and late went home, leaving my wife still there. So to bed.
