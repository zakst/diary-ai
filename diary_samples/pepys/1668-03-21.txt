21st. Up betimes to the office, and there we sat all the morning, at
noon home with my clerks, a good dinner, and then to the Office, and
wrote my letters, and then abroad to do several things, and pay what
little scores I had, and among others to Mrs. Martinâ€™s, and there did
give 20s. to Mrs. Cragg, her landlady, who was my Valentine in the
house, as well as Doll Lane.... So home and to the office, there to end
my letters, and so home, where Betty Turner was to see my wife, and she
being gone I to my chamber to read a little again, and then after supper
to bed.
