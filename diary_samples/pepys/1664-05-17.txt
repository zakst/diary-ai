17th. Slept well all night and lay long, then rose and wrote my letter
to my father about Pall, as we had resolved last night. So to dinner
and then to the office, finding myself better than I was, and making
a little water, but not yet breaking any great store of wind, which I
wonder at, for I cannot be well till I do do it. After office home and
to supper and with good ease to bed, and endeavoured to tie my hands
that I might not lay them out of bed, by which I believe I have got
cold, but I could not endure it.
