29th. At the office all the morning. Then to the Wardrobe, and there
coming late dined with the people below. Then up to my Lady, and staid
two hours talking with her about her family business with great content
and confidence in me. So calling at several places I went home, where
my people are getting the house clean against to-morrow. I to the office
and wrote several letters by post, and so home and to bed.
