4th. My Lord went this morning on his journey to Hinchingbroke, Mr.
Parker with him; the chief business being to look over and determine
how, and in what manner, his great work of building shall be done.
Before his going he did give me some jewells to keep for him, viz., that
that the King of Sweden did give him, with the Kingâ€™s own picture in
it, most excellently done; and a brave George, all of diamonds, and
this with the greatest expressions of love and confidence that I could
imagine or hope for, which is a very great joy to me. To the office all
the forenoon. Then to dinner and so to Whitehall to Mr. Coventry about
several businesses, and then with Mr. Moore, who went with me to drink a
cup of ale, and after some good discourse then home and sat late talking
with Sir W. Batten. So home and to bed.
