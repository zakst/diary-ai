10th (Lord’s day). Up and by water, towards noon, to Somersett House,
and walked to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there dined with my Lady and the
children. And after some ordinary discourse with my Lady, after dinner
took our leaves and my wife hers, in order to her going to the country
to-morrow. But my Lord took not occasion to speak one word of my father
or mother about the children at all, which I wonder at, and begin I will
not. Here my Lady showed us my Lady Castlemayne’s picture, finely done;
given my Lord; and a most beautiful picture it is. Thence with my Lady
Jemimah and Mr. Sidney to St. Gyles’s Church, and there heard a long,
poore sermon. Thence set them down and in their coach to Kate Joyce’s
christening, where much company, good service of sweetmeates; and after
an houre’s stay, left them, and in my Lord’s coach--his noble, rich
coach--home, and there my wife fell to putting things in order against
her going to-morrow, and I to read, and so to bed, where I not well, and
so had no pleasure at all with my poor wife.
