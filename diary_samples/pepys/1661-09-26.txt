26th. At the office all the morning, so dined at home, and then abroad
with my wife by coach to the Theatre to shew her “King and no King,”
 it being very well done. And so by coach, though hard to get it, being
rainy, home. So to my chamber to write letters and the journal for these
six last days past.
