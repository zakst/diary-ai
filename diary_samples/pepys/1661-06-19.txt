19th. All the morning almost at home, seeing my stairs finished by the
painters, which pleases me well. So with Mr. Moore to Westminster Hall,
it being term, and then by water to the Wardrobe, where very merry, and
so home to the office all the afternoon, and at night to the Exchange
to my uncle Wight about my intention of purchasing at Brampton. So back
again home and at night to bed. Thanks be to God I am very well again
of my late pain, and to-morrow hope to be out of my pain of dirt and
trouble in my house, of which I am now become very weary. One thing I
must observe here while I think of it, that I am now become the most
negligent man in the world as to matters of news, insomuch that,
now-a-days, I neither can tell any, nor ask any of others.
