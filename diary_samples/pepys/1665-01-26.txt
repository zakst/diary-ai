26th. Lay, being in some pain, but not much, with my last nightâ€™s
bruise, but up and to my office, where busy all the morning, the like
after dinner till very late, then home to supper and to bed. My wife
mightily troubled with the tooth ake, and my cold not being gone yet,
but my bruise yesterday goes away again, and it chiefly occasioned I
think now from the sudden change of the weather from a frost to a great
rayne on a sudden.
