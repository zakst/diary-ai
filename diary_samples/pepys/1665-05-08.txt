8th. Up very betimes, and did much business before I went out with
several persons, among others Captain Taylor, who would leave the
management of most of his business now he is going to Harwich, upon me,
and if I can get money by it, which I believe it will, I shall take some
of it upon me. Thence with Sir W. Batten to the Duke of Albemarle’s and
there did much business, and then to the ‘Change, and thence off with
Sir W. Warren to an ordinary, where we dined and sat talking of most
usefull discourse till 5 in the afternoon, and then home, and very busy
till late, and so home and to bed.
