9th. To the office, where we sat all the morning busy. At noon home to
dinner, and then to my office again, where also busy, very busy late,
and then went home and read a piece of a play, “Every Man in his
Humour,”--[Ben Jonson’s well-known play.]--wherein is the greatest
propriety of speech that ever I read in my life: and so to bed. This
noon come my wife’s watchmaker, and received L12 of me for her watch;
but Captain Rolt coming to speak with me about a little business, he did
judge of the work to be very good work, and so I am well contented, and
he hath made very good, that I knew, to Sir W. Pen and Lady Batten.
