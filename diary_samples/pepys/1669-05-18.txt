18th. Up, and to St. James’s and other places, and then to the office,
where all the morning. At noon home and dined in my wife’s chamber, she
being much troubled with the tooth-ake, and I staid till a surgeon of
hers come, one Leeson, who hath formerly drawn her mouth, and he advised
her to draw it: so I to the Office, and by and by word is come that
she hath drawn it, which pleased me, it being well done. So I home, to
comfort her, and so back to the office till night, busy, and so home to
supper and to bed.
