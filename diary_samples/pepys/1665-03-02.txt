2nd. Begun this day to rise betimes before six o’clock, and, going down
to call my people, found Besse and the girle with their clothes on,
lying within their bedding upon the ground close by the fireside, and
a candle burning all night, pretending they would rise to scoure. This
vexed me, but Besse is going and so she will not trouble me long. Up,
and by water to Burston about my Lord’s plate, and then home to the
office, so there all the morning sitting. At noon dined with Sir W.
Batten (my wife being gone again to-day to buy things, having bought
nothing yesterday for lack of Mrs. Pierces company), and thence to the
office again, where very busy till 12 at night, and vexed at my wife’s
staying out so late, she not being at home at 9 o’clock, but at last she
is come home, but the reason of her stay I know not yet. So shut up my
books, and home to supper and to bed.
