7th. At the office all the morning. At noon Mr. Moore dined with me, and
then in comes Wm. Joyce to answer a letter of mine I wrote this morning
to him about a maid of his that my wife had hired, and she sent us word
that she was hired to stay longer with her master, which mistake he came
to clear himself of; and I took it very kindly. So I having appointed
the young ladies at the Wardrobe to go with them to a play to-day, I
left him and my brother Tom who came along with him to dine, and my wife
and I took them to the Theatre, where we seated ourselves close by the
King, and Duke of York, and Madame Palmer, which was great content; and,
indeed, I can never enough admire her beauty. And here was “Bartholomew
Fayre,” with the puppet-show, acted to-day, which had not been these
forty years (it being so satyricall against Puritanism, they durst not
till now, which is strange they should already dare to do it, and the
King do countenance it), but I do never a whit like it the better for
the puppets, but rather the worse. Thence home with the ladies, it being
by reason of our staying a great while for the King’s coming, and the
length of the play, near nine o’clock before it was done, and so in
their coach home, and still in discontent with my wife, to bed, and rose
so this morning also.
