2nd. Early to coach again and to Kingston, where we baited a little, and
presently to coach again and got early to London, and I found all well
at home, and Mr. Hunt and his wife had dined with my wife to-day, and
been very kind to my wife in my absence. After I had washed myself, it
having been the hottest day that has been this year, I took them all
by coach to Mrs. Hunt’s, and I to Dr. Clerke’s lady, and gave her her
letter and token. She is a very fine woman, and what with her person
and the number of fine ladies that were with her, I was much out of
countenance, and could hardly carry myself like a man among them; but
however, I staid till my courage was up again, and talked to them, and
viewed her house, which is most pleasant, and so drank and good-night.
And so to my Lord’s lodgings, where by chance I spied my Lady’s coach,
and found her and my Lady Wright there, and so I spoke to them, and they
being gone went to Mr. Hunt’s for my wife, and so home and to bed.
