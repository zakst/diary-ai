2nd. Then up and to my office, where till noon and then to the ‘Change,
and at the Coffee-house with Gifford, Hubland, the Master of the ship,
and I read over and approved a charter-party for carrying goods for
Tangier, wherein I hope to get some money. Thence home, my head akeing
for want of rest and too much business. So to the office. At night
comes, Povy, and he and I to Mrs. Bland’s to discourse about my serving
her to helpe her to a good passage for Tangier. Here I heard her
kinswoman sing 3 or 4 very fine songs and in good manner, and then home
and to supper. My cook mayd Jane and her mistresse parted, and she
went away this day. I vexed to myself, but was resolved to have no more
trouble, and so after supper to my office and then to bed.
