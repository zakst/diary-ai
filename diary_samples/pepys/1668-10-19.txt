19th. Up, and to my office to set down my Journall for some days past,
and so to other business. At the office all the morning upon some
business of Sir W. Warren’s, and at noon home to dinner, and thence
out by coach with my wife and Deb. and Mr. Harman, the upholster, and
carried them to take measure of Mr. Wren’s bed at St. James’s, I being
resolved to have just such another made me, and thence set him down in
the Strand, and my wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse; and there
saw, the first time acted, “The Queene of Arragon,” an old Blackfriars
play, but an admirable one, so good that I am astonished at it, and
wonder where it hath lain asleep all this while, that I have never heard
of it before. Here met W. Batelier and Mrs. Hunt, Deb.’s aunt; and
saw her home--a very witty woman, and one that knows this play, and
understands a play mighty well. Left her at home in Jewen Street, and we
home, and to supper, and my wife to read to me, and so to bed.
