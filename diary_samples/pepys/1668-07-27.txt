27th. Busy all the morning at my office. At noon dined, and then I out
of doors to my bookseller in Duck Lane, but su moher not at home, and it
was pretty here to see a pretty woman pass by with a little wanton look,
and je did sequi her round about the street from Duck Lane to Newgate
Market, and then elle did turn back, and je did lose her. And so to see
my Lord Crew, whom I find up; and did wait on him; but his face sore,
but in hopes to do now very well again. Thence to Cooper’s, where my
wife’s picture almost done, and mighty fine indeed. So over the water
with my wife, and Deb., and Mercer, to Spring-Garden, and there eat and
walked; and observe how rude some of the young gallants of the town are
become, to go into people’s arbours where there are not men, and almost
force the women; which troubled me, to see the confidence of the vice of
the age: and so we away by water, with much pleasure home. This day my
plate-maker comes with my four little plates of the four Yards, cost me
L5, which troubles me, but yet do please me also.
