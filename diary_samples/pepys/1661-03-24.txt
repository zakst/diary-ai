24th (Lord’s day). My wife and I to church, and then home with Sir
W. Batten and my Lady to dinner, where very merry, and then to church
again, where Mr. Mills made a good sermon. Home again, and after a
walk in the garden Sir W. Batten’s two daughters came and sat with us a
while, and I then up to my chamber to read.
