3rd. At the office all the morning; dined at home, and in the afternoon
Mr. Moore came to me, and he and I went to Tower Hill to meet with a
man, and so back all three to my house, and there I signed a bond to Mr.
Battersby, a friend of Mr. Moore’s, who lends me L50, the first money
that ever I borrowed upon bond for my own occasion, and so I took them
to the Mitre and a Portugal millon with me; there sat and discoursed in
matters of religion till night with great pleasure, and so parted, and
I home, calling at Sir W. Batten’s, where his son and his wife were, who
had yesterday been at the play where we were, and it was good sport to
hear how she talked of it with admiration like a fool. So home, and my
head was not well with the wine that I drank to-day.
