11th. Up and to my office all the morning, and at noon to the
Coffee-house, where with Dr. Allen some good discourse about physique
and chymistry. And among other things, I telling him what Dribble the
German Doctor do offer of an instrument to sink ships; he tells me that
which is more strange, that something made of gold, which they call in
chymistry Aurum fulminans, a grain, I think he said, of it put into a
silver spoon and fired, will give a blow like a musquett, and strike
a hole through the spoon downward, without the least force upward; and
this he can make a cheaper experiment of, he says, with iron prepared.
Thence to the ‘Change, and being put off a meeting with T. Trice, he not
coming, I home to dinner, and after dinner by coach with my wife to my
periwigg maker’s for my second periwigg, but it is not done, and so,
calling at a place or two, home, and there to my office, and there
taught my wife a new lesson in arithmetique and so sent her home, and I
to several businesses; and so home to supper and to bed, being mightily
troubled with a cold in my stomach and head, with a great pain by
coughing.
