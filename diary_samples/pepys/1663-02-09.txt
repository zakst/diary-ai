9th. Could not rise and go to the Duke, as I should have done with the
rest, but keep my bed and by the Apothecary’s advice, Mr. Battersby,
I am to sweat soundly, and that will carry all this matter away which
nature would of itself eject, but they will assist nature, it being some
disorder given the blood, but by what I know not, unless it be by my
late quantitys of Dantzic-girkins that I have eaten. In the evening came
Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten to see me, and Sir J. Minnes advises
me to the same thing, but would not have me take anything from the
apothecary, but from him, his Venice treacle being better than the
others, which I did consent to and did anon take and fell into a great
sweat, and about 10 or 11 o’clock came out of it and shifted myself, and
slept pretty well alone, my wife lying in the red chamber above.
