9th. To Whitehall and there with Mr. Creed took a most pleasant walk
for two hours in the park, which is now a very fair place. Here we had a
long and candid discourse one to another of one another’s condition, and
he giving me an occasion I told him of my intention to get L60 paid me
by him for a gratuity for my labour extraordinary at sea. Which he did
not seem unwilling to, and therefore I am very glad it is out. To my
Lord’s, where we found him lately come from Hinchingbroke, where he left
my uncle very well, but my aunt not likely to live. I staid and dined
with him. He took me aside, and asked me what the world spoke of the
King’s marriage. Which I answering as one that knew nothing, he enquired
no further of me. But I do perceive by it that there is something in it
that is ready to come out that the world knows not of yet. After dinner
into London to Mrs. Turner’s and my father’s, made visits and then home,
where I sat late making of my journal for four days past, and so to bed.
