19th. Lay long in bed, so to the office, where all the morning. At noon
dined with Sir W. Warren at the Pope’s Head. So back to the office, and
there met with the Commissioners of the Ordnance, where Sir W. Pen being
almost drunk vexed me, and the more because Mr. Chichly observed it with
me, and it was a disparagement to the office. They gone I to my office.
Anon comes home my wife from Brampton, not looked for till Saturday,
which will hinder me of a little pleasure, but I am glad of her coming.
She tells me Pall’s business with Ensum is like to go on, but I must
give, and she consents to it, another 100. She says she doubts my father
is in want of money, for rents come in mighty slowly. My mother grows
very unpleasant and troublesome and my father mighty infirm through
his old distemper, which altogether makes me mighty thoughtfull. Having
heard all this and bid her welcome I to the office, where late, and so
home, and after a little more talk with my wife, she to bed and I after
her.
