14th. Lay very long in bed, till with shame forced to rise, being called
up by Mr. Bland about business. He being gone I went and staid upon
business at the office and then home to dinner, and after dinner staid
a little talking pleasant with my wife, who tells me of another woman
offered by her brother that is pretty and can sing, to which I do listen
but will not appear over forward, but I see I must keep somebody for
company sake to my wife, for I am ashamed she should live as she do.
So to the office till 10 at night upon business, and numbering and
examining part of my sea-manuscript with great pleasure, my wife sitting
working by me. So home to supper and to bed.
