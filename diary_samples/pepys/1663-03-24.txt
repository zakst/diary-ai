24th. Lay pretty long, that is, till past six o’clock, and them up and
W. Howe and I very merry together, till having eat our breakfast, he
went away, and I to my office. By and by Sir J. Minnes and I to the
Victualling Office by appointment to meet several persons upon stating
the demands of some people of money from the King. Here we went into
their Bakehouse, and saw all the ovens at work, and good bread too, as
ever I would desire to eat. Thence Sir J. Minnes and I homewards calling
at Browne’s, the mathematician in the Minnerys, with a design of buying
White’s ruler to measure timber with, but could not agree on the price.
So home, and to dinner, and so to my office, where we sat anon, and
among other things had Cooper’s business tried against Captain Holmes,
but I find Cooper a fuddling, troublesome fellow, though a good artist,
and so am contented to have him turned out of his place, nor did I see
reason to say one word against it, though I know what they did against
him was with great envy and pride. So anon broke up, and after writing
letters, &c., home to supper and to bed.
