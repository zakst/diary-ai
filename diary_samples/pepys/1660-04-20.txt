20th. All the morning I was busy to get my window altered, and to
have my table set as I would have it, which after it was done I was
infinitely pleased with it, and also to see what a command I have to
have every one ready to come and go at my command. This evening came Mr.
Boyle on board, for whom I writ an order for a ship to transport him
to Flushing. He supped with my Lord, my Lord using him as a person
of honour. This evening too came Mr. John Pickering on board us.
This evening my head ached exceedingly, which I impute to my sitting
backwards in my cabin, otherwise than I am used to do. To-night Mr.
Sheply told me that he heard for certain at Dover that Mr. Edw. Montagu
did go beyond sea when he was here first the other day, and I am apt to
believe that he went to speak with the King. This day one told me how
that at the election at Cambridge for knights of the shire, Wendby and
Thornton by declaring to stand for the Parliament and a King and the
settlement of the Church, did carry it against all expectation against
Sir Dudley North and Sir Thomas Willis! I supped to-night with Mr.
Sheply below at the half-deck table, and after that I saw Mr. Pickering
whom my Lord brought down to his cabin, and so to bed.
