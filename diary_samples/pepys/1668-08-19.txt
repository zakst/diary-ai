19th. Up betimes, and all day and afternoon without going out, busy upon
my great letter to the Duke of York, which goes on to my content. W.
Hewer and Gibson I employ with me in it. This week my people wash, over
the water, and so I little company at home. In the evening, being busy
above, a great cry I hear, and go down; and what should it be but Jane,
in a fit of direct raving, which lasted half-an-hour. Beyond four or
five of our strength to keep her down; and, when all come to all, a fit
of jealousy about Tom, with whom she is in love. So at night, I, and my
wife, and W. Hewer called them to us, and there I did examine all the
thing, and them, in league. She in love, and he hath got her to promise
him to marry, and he is now cold in it, so that I must rid my hands of
them, which troubles me, and the more because my head is now busy upon
other greater things. I am vexed also to be told by W. Hewer that he is
summoned to the Commissioners of Accounts about receiving a present of
L30 from Mr. Mason, the timber merchant, though there be no harm in
it, that will appear on his part, he having done them several lawful
kindnesses and never demanded anything, as they themselves have this day
declared to the Commissioners, they being forced up by the discovery of
somebody that they in confidence had once told it to. So to supper vexed
and my head full of care, and so to bed.
