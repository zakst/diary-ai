15th. Up, and to White Hall about several businesses, but chiefly to
see the proposals of my warrants about Tangier under Creed, but to my
trouble found them not finished. So back to the office, where all the
morning, busy, then home to dinner, and then all the afternoon till very
late at my office, and then home to supper and to bed, weary.
