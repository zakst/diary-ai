18th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where Sir W. Pen was the first
time [since he] come from sea, after the battle. Mr. Mills made a sorry
sermon to prove that there was a world to come after this. Home and
dined and then to my chamber, where all the afternoon. Anon comes Mr.
Andrews to see and sing with me, but Mr. Hill not coming, and having
business, we soon parted, there coming Mr. Povy and Creed to discourse
about our Tangier business of money. They gone, I hear Sir W. Batten and
my Lady are returned from Harwich. I went to see them, and it is pretty
to see how we appear kind one to another, though neither of us care 2d.
one for another. Home to supper, and there coming a hasty letter from
Commissioner Pett for pressing of some calkers (as I would ever on
his Majesty’s service), with all speed, I made a warrant presently and
issued it. So to my office a little, and then home to bed.
