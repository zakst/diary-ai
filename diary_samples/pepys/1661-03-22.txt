22nd. This morning I rose early, and my Lady Batten knocked at her door
that comes into one of my chambers, and called me to know whether I
and my wife were ready to go. So my wife got her ready, and about eight
o’clock I got a horseback, and my Lady and her two daughters, and Sir W.
Pen into coach, and so over London Bridge, and thence to Dartford. The
day very pleasant, though the way bad. Here we met with Sir W. Batten,
and some company along with him, who had assisted him in his election at
Rochester; and so we dined and were very merry. At 5 o’clock we set out
again in a coach home, and were very merry all the way. At Deptford we
met with Mr. Newborne, and some other friends and their wives in a coach
to meet us, and so they went home with us, and at Sir W. Batten’s we
supped, and thence to bed, my head akeing mightily through the wine that
I drank to-day.
