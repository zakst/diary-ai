23rd. Up, and to the office all the morning. At noon Sir W. Batten
told me Sir Richard Ford would accept of one-third of my profit of our
private man-of-war, and bear one-third of the charge, and be bound in
the Admiralty, so I shall be excused being bound, which I like mightily
of, and did draw up a writing, as well as I could, to that purpose and
signed and sealed it, and so he and Sir R. Ford are to go to enter into
bond this afternoon. Home to dinner, and after dinner, it being late,
I down by water to Shadwell, to see Betty Michell, the first time I was
ever at their new dwelling since the fire, and there find her in the
house all alone. I find her mighty modest. But had her lips as much as
I would, and indeed she is mighty pretty, that I love her exceedingly. I
paid her L10 1s. that I received upon a ticket for her husband, which
is a great kindness I have done them, and having kissed her as much as
I would, I away, poor wretch, and down to Deptford to see Sir J. Minnes
ordering of the pay of some ships there, which he do most miserably, and
so home. Bagwellâ€™s wife, seeing me come the fields way, did get over her
pales to come after and talk with me, which she did for a good way, and
so parted, and I home, and to the office, very busy, and so to supper
and to bed.
