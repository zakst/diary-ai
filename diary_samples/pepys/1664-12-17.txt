17th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon I
to the ‘Change, and there, among others, had my first meeting with Mr.
L’Estrange, who hath endeavoured several times to speak with me. It is
to get, now and then, some newes of me, which I shall, as I see cause,
give him. He is a man of fine conversation, I think, but I am sure most
courtly and full of compliments. Thence home to dinner, and then come
the looking-glass man to set up the looking-glass I bought yesterday,
in my dining-room, and very handsome it is. So abroad by coach to White
Hall, and there to the Committee of Tangier, and then the Fishing. Mr.
Povy did in discourse give me a rub about my late bill for money that
I did get of him, which vexed me and stuck in my mind all this evening,
though I know very well how to cleare myself at the worst. So home and
to my office, where late, and then home to bed. Mighty talke there is
of this Comet that is seen a’nights; and the King and Queene did sit up
last night to see it, and did, it seems. And to-night I thought to
have done so too; but it is cloudy, and so no stars appear. But I will
endeavour it. Mr. Gray did tell me to-night, for certain, that the
Dutch, as high as they seem, do begin to buckle; and that one man in
this Kingdom did tell the King that he is offered L40,000 to make a
peace, and others have been offered money also. It seems the taking of
their Bourdeaux fleete thus, arose from a printed Gazette of the Dutch’s
boasting of fighting, and having beaten the English: in confidence
whereof (it coming to Bourdeaux), all the fleete comes out, and so falls
into our hands.
