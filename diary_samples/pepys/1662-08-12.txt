12th. Up early at my office, and I find all people beginning to come to
me. Among others Mr. Deane, the Assistant of Woolwich, who I find will
discover to me the whole abuse that his Majesty suffers in the measuring
of timber, of which I shall be glad. He promises me also a modell of a
ship, which will please me exceedingly, for I do want one of my own.
By and by we sat, and among other things Sir W. Batten and I had a
difference about his clerk’s making a warrant for a Maister, which
I would not suffer, but got another signed, which he desires may be
referred to a full board, and I am willing to it. But though I did
get another signed of my own clerk’s, yet I will give it to his clerk,
because I would not be judged unkind, and though I will stand upon my
privilege. At noon home and to dinner alone, and so to the office again,
where busy all the afternoon till to o’clock at night, and so to supper
and to bed, my mind being a little disquieted about Sir W. Batten’s
dispute to-day, though this afternoon I did speak with his man Norman at
last, and told him the reason of my claim.
