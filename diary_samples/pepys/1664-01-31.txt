31st (Lord’s day). Up, and in my chamber all day long (but a little
at dinner) settling all my Brampton accounts to this day in very good
order, I having obliged myself by oathe to do that and some other things
within this month, and did also perfectly prepare a state of my estate
and annexed it to my last will and testament, which now is perfect, and,
lastly, I did make up my monthly accounts, and find that I have gained
above L50 this month clear, and so am worth L858 clear, which is the
greatest sum I ever yet was master of, and also read over my usual
vowes, as I do every Lord’s day, but with greater seriousness than
ordinary, and I do hope that every day I shall see more and more the
pleasure of looking after my business and laying up of money, and
blessed be God for what I have already been enabled by his grace to do.
So to supper and to bed with my mind in mighty great ease and content,
but my head very full of thoughts and business to dispatch this next
month also, and among others to provide for answering to the Exchequer
for my uncle’s being Generall-Receiver in the year 1647, which I am at
present wholly unable to do, but I must find time to look over all his
papers.
