15th. Up, I bless God being now in pretty good condition, but cannot
come to make natural stools yet..... So up and to the office, where
we sat all the morning, and at noon dined at home, my head full of
business, and after stepping abroad to buy a thing or two, compasses and
snuffers for my wife, I returned to my office and there mighty busy till
it was late, and so home well contented with the business that I had
done this afternoon, and so to supper and to bed.
