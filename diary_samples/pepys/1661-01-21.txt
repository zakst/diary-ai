21st. This morning Sir W. Batten, the Comptroller and I to Westminster,
to the Commissioners for paying off the Army and Navy, where the Duke
of Albemarle was; and we sat with our hats on, and did discourse about
paying off the ships and do find that they do intend to undertake it
without our help; and we are glad of it, for it is a work that will much
displease the poor seamen, and so we are glad to have no hand in it.
From thence to the Exchequer, and took L200 and carried it home, and so
to the office till night, and then to see Sir W. Pen, whither came my
Lady Batten and her daughter, and then I sent for my wife, and so we sat
talking till it was late. So home to supper and then to bed, having
eat no dinner to-day. It is strange what weather we have had all this
winter; no cold at all; but the ways are dusty, and the flyes fly up and
down, and the rose-bushes are full of leaves, such a time of the year
as was never known in this world before here. This day many more of the
Fifth Monarchy men were hanged.
