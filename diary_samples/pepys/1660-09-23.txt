23rd. This morning standing looking upon the workmen doing of my new
door to my house, there comes Captain Straughan the Scot (to whom the
King has given half of the money that the two ships lately sold do
bring), and he would needs take me to the Dolphin, and give me a glass
of ale and a peck of oysters, he and I. He did talk much what he is able
to advise the King for good husbandry in his ships, as by ballasting
them with lead ore and many other tricks, but I do believe that he is a
knowing man in sea-business. Home and dined, and in the afternoon to the
office, where till late, and that being done Mr. Creed did come to speak
with me, and I took him to the Dolphin, where there was Mr. Pierce the
purser and his wife and some friends of theirs. So I did spend a crown
upon them behind the bar, they being akin to the people of the house,
and this being the house where Mr. Pierce was apprentice. After they
were gone Mr. Creed and I spent an hour in looking over the account
which he do intend to pass in our office for his lending moneys, which
I did advise about and approve or disapprove of as I saw cause. After
an hour being, serious at this we parted about 11 oâ€™clock at night. So I
home and to bed, leaving my wife and the maid at their linen to get up.
