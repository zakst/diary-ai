18th. Up, and all the morning at the office, and then to dinner, and
after dinner to the office to dictate some letters, and then with my
wife to Sir W. Turnerâ€™s to visit The., but she being abroad we back
again home, and then I to the office, finished my letters, and then to
walk an hour in the garden talking with my wife, whose growth in musique
do begin to please me mightily, and by and by home and there find our
Luce drunk, and when her mistress told her of it would be gone, and so
put up some of her things and did go away of her accord, nobody pressing
her to it, and the truth is, though she be the dirtiest, homeliest
servant that ever I kept, yet I was sorry to have her go, partly through
my love to my servants, and partly because she was a very drudging,
working wench, only she would be drunk. But that which did a little
trouble me was that I did hear her tell her mistress that she would tell
her master something before she was aware of her that she would be
sorry to have him know; but did it in such a silly, drunken manner,
that though it trouble me a little, yet not knowing what to suspect she
should know, and not knowing well whether she said it to her mistress or
Jane, I did not much think of it. So she gone, we to supper and to bed,
my study being made finely clean.
