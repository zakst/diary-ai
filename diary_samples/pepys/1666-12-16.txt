16th. Up, and to the office, where sat to do little business but hear
clamours for money. At noon home to dinner, and to the office again,
after hearing my brother play a little upon the Lyra viall, which he do
so as to show that he hath a love to musique and a spirit for it, which
I am well pleased with. All the afternoon at the office, and at night
with Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Pen, [and Sir] J. Minnes, at [Sir] W. Pen’s
lodgings, advising about business and orders fit presently to make about
discharging of ships come into the river, and which to pay first, and
many things in order thereto. But it vexed me that, it being now past
seven o’clock, and the businesses of great weight, and I had done them
by eight o’clock, and sending them to be signed, they were all gone to
bed, and Sir W. Pen, though awake, would not, being in bed, have them
brought to him to sign; this made me quite angry. Late at work at the
office, and then home to supper and to bed. Not come to any resolution
at the Parliament to-day about the manner of raising this L1,800,000.
