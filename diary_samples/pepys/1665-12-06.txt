6th. Up betimes, it being fast-day; and by water to the Duke of
Albemarle, who come to towne from Oxford last night. He is mighty brisk,
and very kind to me, and asks my advice principally in every thing.
He surprises me with the news that my Lord Sandwich goes Embassador to
Spayne speedily; though I know not whence this arises, yet I am heartily
glad of it. He did give me several directions what to do, and so I home
by water again and to church a little, thinking to have met Mrs. Pierce
in order to our meeting at night; but she not there, I home and dined,
and comes presently by appointment my wife. I spent the afternoon upon a
song of Solyman’s words to Roxalana that I have set, and so with my wife
walked and Mercer to Mrs. Pierce’s, where Captain Rolt and Mrs. Knipp,
Mr. Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Mrs. Worshipp and her singing
daughter, met; and by and by unexpectedly comes Mr. Pierce from Oxford.
Here the best company for musique I ever was in, in my life, and wish I
could live and die in it, both for musique and the face of Mrs. Pierce,
and my wife and Knipp, who is pretty enough; but the most excellent,
mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that ever I heard in my life,
and Rolt, with her, some things together most excellently. I spent the
night in extasy almost; and, having invited them to my house a day or
two hence, we broke up, Pierce having told me that he is told how the
King hath done my Lord Sandwich all the right imaginable, by shewing
him his countenance before all the world on every occasion, to remove
thoughts of discontent; and that he is to go Embassador, and that the
Duke of Yorke is made generall of all forces by land and sea, and
the Duke of Albemarle, lieutenant-generall. Whether the two latter
alterations be so, true or no, he knows not, but he is told so; but my
Lord is in full favour with the King. So all home and to bed.
