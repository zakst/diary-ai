18th. Up, and to the office, where I hear the ill news that poor
Batters, that had been born and bred a seaman, and brought up his ship
from sea but yesterday, was, going down from me to his ship, drowned in
the Thames, which is a sad fortune, and do make me afeard, and will do,
more than ever I was. At noon dined at home, and then by coach to my
Lord Bellasses, but not at home. So to Westminster Hall, where the Lords
are sitting still, I to see Mrs. Martin, who is very well, and intends
to go abroad to-morrow after her childbed. She do tell me that this
child did come is ‘meme jour that it ought to hazer after my avoir ete
con elle before her marid did venir home.... Thence to the Swan, and
there I sent for Sarah, and mighty merry we were.... So to Sir Robert
Viner’s about my plate, and carried home another dozen of plates, which
makes my stock of plates up 2 1/2 dozen, and at home find Mr. Thomas
Andrews, with whom I staid and talked a little and invited him to dine
with me at Christmas, and then I to the office, and there late doing
business, and so home and to bed. Sorry for poor Batters.
