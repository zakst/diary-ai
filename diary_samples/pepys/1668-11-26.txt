26th. Up, and at the Office all the morning, where I was to have
delivered the Duke of York’s letter of advice to the Board, in answer
to our several answers to his great letter; but Lord Brouncker not being
there, and doubtful to deliver it before the new Treasurers, I forbore
it to next sitting. So home at noon to dinner, where I find Mr. Pierce
and his wife but I was forced to shew very little pleasure in her being
there because of my vow to my wife; and therefore was glad of a very bad
occasion for my being really troubled, which is, at W. Hewer’s losing
of a tally of L1000, which I sent him this day to receive of the
Commissioners of Excise. So that though I hope at the worst I shall be
able to get another, yet I made use of this to get away as soon as I had
dined, and therefore out with him to the Excise Office to make a stop of
its payment, and so away to the coachmaker’s and several other places,
and so away home, and there to my business at the office, and thence
home, and there my wife to read to me, and W. Hewer to set some matters
of accounts right at my chamber, to bed.
