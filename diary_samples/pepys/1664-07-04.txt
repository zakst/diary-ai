4th. Up, and many people with me about business, and then out to several
places, and so at noon to my Lord Crew’s, and there dined and very much
made of there by him. He offered me the selling of some land of his in
Cambridgeshire, a purchase of about L1000, and if I can compass it I
will. After dinner I walked homeward, still doing business by the way,
and at home find my wife this day of her owne accord to have lain
out 25s. upon a pair of pendantes for her eares, which did vex me and
brought both me and her to very high and very foule words from her
to me, such as trouble me to think she should have in her mouth, and
reflecting upon our old differences, which I hate to have remembered. I
vowed to breake them, or that she should go and get what she could for
them again. I went with that resolution out of doors; the poor wretch
afterwards in a little while did send out to change them for her money
again. I followed Besse her messenger at the ‘Change, and there
did consult and sent her back; I would not have them changed, being
satisfied that she yielded. So went home, and friends again as to that
business; but the words I could not get out of my mind, and so went to
bed at night discontented, and she came to bed to me, but all would not
make me friends, but sleep and rise in the morning angry. This day the
King and the Queene went to visit my Lord Sandwich and the fleete, going
forth in the Hope.

     [“Their Majesties were treated at Tilbury Hope by the Earl of
     Sandwich, returning the same day, abundantly satisfied both with the
     dutiful respects of that honourable person and with the excellent
     condition of all matters committed to his charge” (“The Newes,” July
