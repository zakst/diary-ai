16th (Lord’s day). To church this morning, and so home and to dinner.
In the afternoon I walked to St. Bride’s to church, to hear Dr. Jacomb
preach upon the recovery, and at the request of Mrs. Turner, who came
abroad this day, the first time since her long sickness. He preached
upon David’s words, “I shall not die, but live, and declare the works
of the Lord,” and made a pretty good sermon, though not extraordinary.
After sermon I led her home, and sat with her, and there was the Dr. got
before us; but strange what a command he hath got over Mrs. Turner, who
was so carefull to get him what he would, after his preaching, to drink,
and he, with a cunning gravity, knows how to command, and had it, and
among other things told us that he heard more of the Common Prayer this
afternoon (while he stood in the vestry, before he went up into the
pulpitt) than he had heard this twenty years. Thence to my uncle Wight
to meet my wife, and with other friends of hers and his met by chance we
were very merry, and supped, and so home, not being very well through my
usual pain got by cold. So to prayers and to bed, and there had a good
draft of mulled ale brought me.
