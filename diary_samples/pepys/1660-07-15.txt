15th. Lay long in bed to recover my rest. Going forth met with Mr.
Sheply, and went and drank my morning draft with him at Wilkinson’s,
and my brother Spicer.--[Jack Spicer, brother clerk of the Privy
Seal.]--After that to Westminster Abbey, and in Henry the Seventh’s
Chappell heard part of a sermon, the first that ever I heard there. To
my Lord’s and dined all alone at the table with him. After dinner he and
I alone fell to discourse, and I find him plainly to be a sceptic in all
things of religion, and to make no great matter of anything therein, but
to be a perfect Stoic. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh’s Chappell,
where I heard service and a sermon there, and after that meeting W.
Bowyer there, he and I to the Park, and walked a good while till night.
So to Harper’s and drank together, and Captain Stokes came to us and so
I fell into discourse of buying paper at the first hand in my office,
and the Captain promised me to buy it for me in France. After that to
my Lord’s lodgings, where I wrote some business and so home. My wife
at home all the day, she having no clothes out, all being packed up
yesterday. For this month I have wholly neglected anything of news, and
so have beyond belief been ignorant how things go, but now by my patent
my mind is in some quiet, which God keep. I was not at my father’s
to-day, I being afraid to go for fear he should still solicit me to
speak to my Lord for a place in the Wardrobe, which I dare not do,
because of my own business yet. My wife and I mightily pleased with our
new house that we hope to have. My patent has cost me a great deal of
money, about L40, which is the only thing at present which do trouble
me much. In the afternoon to Henry the Seventh’s chapel, where I heard
a sermon and spent (God forgive me) most of my time in looking upon Mrs.
Butler. After that with W. Bowyer to walk in the Park. Afterwards to
my Lord’s lodgings, and so home to bed, having not been at my father’s
to-day.
