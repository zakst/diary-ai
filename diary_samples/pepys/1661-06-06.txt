6th. My head hath aked all night, and all this morning, with my last
night’s debauch. Called up this morning by Lieutenant Lambert, who is
now made Captain of the Norwich, and he and I went down by water to
Greenwich, in our way observing and discoursing upon the things of a
ship, he telling me all I asked him, which was of good use to me. There
we went and eat and drank and heard musique at the Globe, and saw the
simple motion that is there of a woman with a rod in her hand keeping
time to the musique while it plays, which is simple, methinks. Back
again by water, calling at Captain Lambert’s house, which is very
handsome and neat, and a fine prospect at top. So to the office, where
we sat a little, and then the Captain and I again to Bridewell to Mr.
Holland’s, where his wife also, a plain dowdy, and his mother was. Here
I paid Mrs. Holland the money due from me to her husband. Here came two
young gentlewomen to see Mr. Holland, and one of them could play pretty
well upon the viallin, but, good God! how these ignorant people did cry
her up for it! We were very merry. I staid and supped there, and so home
and to bed. The weather very hot, this night I left off my wastecoat.
