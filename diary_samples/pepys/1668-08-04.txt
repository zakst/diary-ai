4th. Up, and to my office a little, and then to White Hall about a
Committee for Tangier at my Lord Arlington’s, where, by Creed’s being
out of town, I have the trouble given me of drawing up answers to the
complaints of the Turks of Algiers, and so I have all the papers put
into my hand. Here till noon, and then back to the Office, where sat a
little, and then to dinner, and presently to the office, where come to
me my Lord Bellassis, Lieutenant-Colonell Fitzgerald, newly come from
Tangier, and Sir Arthur Basset, and there I received their informations,
and so, they being gone, I with my clerks and another of Lord
Brouncker’s, Seddon, sat up till two in the morning, drawing up my
answers and writing them fair, which did trouble me mightily to sit up
so long, because of my eyes.
