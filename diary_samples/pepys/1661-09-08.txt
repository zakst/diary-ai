8th (Lordâ€™s day). To church, it being a very wet night last night
and to-day, dined at home, and so to church again with my wife in the
afternoon, and coming home again found our new maid Doll asleep, that
she could not hear to let us in, so that we were fain to send the boy in
at a window to open the door to us. So up to my chamber all alone, and
troubled in mind to think how much of late I have addicted myself to
expense and pleasure, that now I can hardly reclaim myself to look after
my great business of settling Gravely business, until now almost too
late. I pray God give me grace to begin now to look after my business,
but it always was, and I fear will ever be, my foible that after I am
once got behind-hand with business, I am hard to set to it again to
recover it. In the evening I begun to look over my accounts and upon
the whole I do find myself, by what I can yet see, worth near L600, for
which God be blessed, which put me into great comfort. So to supper and
to bed.
