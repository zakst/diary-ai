25th (Christmas day). Lay long talking pleasantly with my wife, but
among other things she begun, I know not whether by design or chance, to
enquire what she should do if I should by any accident die, to which I
did give her some slight answer; but shall make good use of it to bring
myself to some settlement for her sake, by making a will as soon as I
can. Up and to church, where Mr. Mills made an ordinary sermon, and so
home and dined with great pleasure with my wife, and all the afternoon
first looking out at window and seeing the boys playing at many several
sports in our back yard by Sir W. Penâ€™s, which reminded me of my own
former times, and then I began to read to my wife upon the globes with
great pleasure and to good purpose, for it will be pleasant to her and
to me to have her understand these things. In the evening at the
office, where I staid late reading Rushworth, which is a most excellent
collection of the beginning of the late quarrels in this kingdom, and so
home to supper and to bed, with good content of mind.
