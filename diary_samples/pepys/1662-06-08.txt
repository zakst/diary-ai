8th (Lord’s day). Lay till church-time in bed, and so up and to church,
and there I found Mr. Mills come home out of the country again, and
preached but a lazy sermon. Home and dined with my wife, and so to
church again with her. Thence walked to my Lady’s, and there supped with
her, and merry, among other things, with the parrott which my Lord
hath brought from the sea, which speaks very well, and cries Pall so
pleasantly, that made my Lord give it my Lady Paulina; but my Lady, her
mother, do not like it. Home, and observe my man Will to walk with his
cloak flung over his shoulder, like a Ruffian, which, whether it was
that he might not be seen to walk along with the footboy, I know not,
but I was vexed at it; and coming home, and after prayers, I did ask him
where he learned that immodest garb, and he answered me that it was not
immodest, or some such slight answer, at which I did give him two
boxes on the ears, which I never did before, and so was after a little
troubled at it.
