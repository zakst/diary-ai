22nd. To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner’s, where there was both at his house
and the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which
I wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I
were fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.
Then back again and to church, my father’s family being all in mourning,
doing him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us
it: so to church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight,
my wife, and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and
supped upon a Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.
