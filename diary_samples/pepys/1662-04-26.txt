26th. Up betimes and among my workmen. By and by to Sir W. Batten, who
with Sir J. M. are going to Chatham this morning, and I was in great
pain till they were gone that I might see whether Sir John do speak any
thing of my chamber that I am afraid of losing or no. But he did not,
and so my mind is a little at more ease. So all day long till night
among my workmen, and in the afternoon did cause the partition between
the entry and the boy’s room to be pulled down to lay it all into one,
which I hope will please me and make my coming in more pleasant. Late at
my office at night writing a letter of excuse to Sir G. Carteret that I
cannot wait upon him to-morrow morning to Chatham as I promised, which
I am loth to do because of my workmen and my wife’s coming to town
to-morrow. So to my lodgings and to bed.
