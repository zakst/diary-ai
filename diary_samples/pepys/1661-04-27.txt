27th. In the morning to my Lord’s, and there dined with my Lady, and
after dinner with Mr. Creed and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre to see
“The Chances,” and after that to the Cock alehouse, where we had a harp
and viallin played to us, and so home by coach to Sir W. Batten’s, who
seems so inquisitive when my house will be made an end of that I am
troubled to go thither. So home with some trouble in my mind about it.
