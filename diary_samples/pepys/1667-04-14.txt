14th (Lord’s day). Up, and to read a little in my new History of Turkey,
and so with my wife to church, and then home, where is little Michell
and my pretty Betty and also Mercer, and very merry. A good dinner of
roast beef. After dinner I away to take water at the Tower, and thence
to Westminster, where Mrs. Martin was not at home. So to White Hall,
and there walked up and down, and among other things visited Sir G.
Carteret, and much talk with him, who is discontented, as he hath
reason, to see how things are like to come all to naught, and it is very
much that this resolution of having of country Admirals should not come
to his eares till I told him the other day, so that I doubt who manages
things. From him to Margaret’s Church, and there spied Martin, and home
with her..... but fell out to see her expensefullness, having bought
Turkey work, chairs, &c. By and by away home, and there took out my
wife, and the two Mercers, and two of our mayds, Barker and Jane, and
over the water to the Jamaica House, where I never was before, and there
the girls did run for wagers over the bowling-green; and there, with
much pleasure, spent little, and so home, and they home, and I to read
with satisfaction in my book of Turkey, and so to bed.
