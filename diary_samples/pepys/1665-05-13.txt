13th. Up, and all day in some little gruntings of pain, as I used to
have from winde, arising I think from my fasting so long, and want of
exercise, and I think going so hot in clothes, the weather being hot,
and the same clothes I wore all winter. To the ‘Change after office,
and received my watch from the watchmaker, and a very fine [one] it is,
given me by Briggs, the Scrivener. Home to dinner, and then I abroad
to the Atturney Generall, about advice upon the Act for Land Carriage,
which he desired not to give me before I had received the King’s and
Council’s order therein; going home bespoke the King’s works, will cost
me 50s., I believe. So home and late at my office. But, Lord! to see how
much of my old folly and childishnesse hangs upon me still that I cannot
forbear carrying my watch in my hand in the coach all this afternoon,
and seeing what o’clock it is one hundred times; and am apt to think
with myself, how could I be so long without one; though I remember
since, I had one, and found it a trouble, and resolved to carry one
no more about me while I lived. So home to supper and to bed, being
troubled at a letter from Mr. Gholmly from Tangier, wherein he do advise
me how people are at worke to overthrow our Victualling business, by
which I shall lose L300 per annum, I am much obliged to him for this,
secret kindnesse, and concerned to repay it him in his own concernments
and look after this.
