8th. All the morning at the office, and after dinner abroad, and among
other things contracted with one Mr. Bridges, at the White Bear on
Cornhill, for 100 pieces of Callico to make flaggs; and as I know I
shall save the King money, so I hope to get a little for my pains and
venture of my own money myself. Late in the evening doing business, and
then comes Captain Tayler, and he and I till 12 oâ€™clock at night arguing
about the freight of his ship Eagle, hired formerly by me to Tangier,
and at last we made an end, and I hope to get a little money, some small
matter by it. So home to bed, being weary and cold, but contented that I
have made an end of that business.
