24th. At home all day. There dined with me Sir William Batten and his
lady and daughter, Sir W. Pen, Mr. Fox (his lady being ill could not
come), and Captain Cuttance; the first dinner I have made since I
came hither. This cost me above L5, and merry we were--only my chimney
smokes. In the afternoon Mr. Hater bringing me my last quarter’s salary,
which I received of him, and so I have now Mr. Barlow’s money in my
hands. The company all go away, and by and by Sir Wms. both and my Lady
Batten and his daughter come again and supped with me and talked till
late, and so to bed, being glad that the trouble is over.
