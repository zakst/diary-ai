4th. Up, and to see Sir W. Coventry, and give him account of my doings
yesterday, which he well liked of, and was told thereof by my Lord
Halifax before; but I do perceive he is much concerned for this
business. Gives me advice to write a smart letter to the Duke of York
about the want of money in the Navy, and desire him to communicate it
to the Commissioners of the Treasury; for he tells me he hath hot
work sometimes to contend with the rest for the Navy, they being all
concerned for some other part of the Kingâ€™s expenses, which they would
prefer to this, of the Navy. He shewed me his closet, with his round
table, for him to sit in the middle, very convenient; and I borrowed
several books of him, to collect things out of the Navy, which I have
not, and so home, and there busy sitting all the morning, and at noon
dined, and then all the afternoon busy, till night, and then to Mile-End
with my wife and girl, and there drank and eat a joie of salmon, at the
Rose and Crown, our old house; and so home to bed.
