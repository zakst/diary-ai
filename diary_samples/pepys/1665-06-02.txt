2nd. Lay troubled in mind abed a good while, thinking of my Tangier and
victualling business, which I doubt will fall. Up and to the Duke
of Albemarle, but missed him. Thence to the Harp and Ball and to
Westminster Hall, where I visited “the flowers” in each place, and so
met with Mr. Creed, and he and I to Mrs. Croft’s to drink and did, but
saw not her daughter Borroughes. I away home, and there dined and did
business. In the afternoon went with my tallys, made a fair end with
Colvill and Viner, delivering them L5000 tallys to each and very quietly
had credit given me upon other tallys of Mr. Colvill for L2000 and
good words for more, and of Mr. Viner too. Thence to visit the Duke of
Albemarle, and thence my Lady Sandwich and Lord Crew. Thence home, and
there met an expresse from Sir W. Batten at Harwich, that the fleete is
all sailed from Solebay, having spied the Dutch fleete at sea, and that,
if the calmes hinder not, they must needs now be engaged with them.
Another letter also come to me from Mr. Hater, committed by the Council
this afternoon to the Gate House, upon the misfortune of having his name
used by one, without his knowledge or privity, for the receiving of
some powder that he had bought. Up to Court about these two, and for the
former was led up to my Lady Castlemayne’s lodgings, where the King and
she and others were at supper, and there I read the letter and returned;
and then to Sir G. Carteret about Hater, and shall have him released
to-morrow, upon my giving bail for his appearance, which I have promised
to do. Sir G. Carteret did go on purpose to the King to ask this, and it
was granted. So home at past 12, almost one o’clock in the morning. To
my office till past two, and then home to supper and to bed.
