15th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy, and after
dinner with my wife, Mercer, and Deb., to the King’s playhouse, and
there saw “Love’s Mistresse” revived, the thing pretty good, but full of
variety of divertisement. So home and to my business at the office, my
eyes bad again, and so to bed.
