3d. All the morning the Officers and Commissioners of the Navy, we met
at Sir G. Carteret’s

     [Sir George Carteret, born 1599, had originally been bred to the sea
     service, and became Comptroller of the Navy to Charles I., and
     Governor of Jersey, where he obtained considerable reputation by his
     gallant defence of that island against the Parliament forces.  At
     the Restoration he was made Vice-Chamberlain to the King, Treasurer
     of the Navy, and a Privy Councillor, and in 1661 he was elected M.P.
     for Portsmouth.  In 1666 he exchanged the Treasurership of the Navy
     with the Earl of Anglesea for the Vice-Treasurership of Ireland.  He
     became a Commissioner of the Admiralty in 1673.  He continued in
     favour with Charles II. till his death, January 14th, 1679, in his
     eightieth year.  He married his cousin Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
     Philip Carteret, Knight of St. Ouen, and had issue three sons and
     five daughters.]

chamber, and agreed upon orders for the Council to supersede the old
ones, and empower us to act. Dined with Mr. Stephens, the Treasurer’s
man of the Navy, and Mr. Turner, to whom I offered L50 out of my own
purse for one year, and the benefit of a Clerk’s allowance beside, which
he thanked me for; but I find he hath some design yet in his head, which
I could not think of. In the afternoon my heart was quite pulled down,
by being told that Mr. Barlow was to enquire to-day for Mr. Coventry;
but at night I met with my Lord, who told me that I need not fear, for
he would get me the place against the world. And when I came to W. Howe,
he told me that Dr. Petty had been with my Lord, and did tell him
that Barlow was a sickly man, and did not intend to execute the place
himself, which put me in great comfort again. Till 2 in the morning
writing letters and things for my Lord to send to sea. So home to my
wife to bed.
