12th. Mr. Townsend called us up by four o’clock; and by five the three
ladies, my wife and I, and Mr. Townsend, his son and daughter, were got
to the barge and set out. We walked from Mortlake to Richmond, and so
to boat again. And from Teddington to Hampton Court Mr. Townsend and I
walked again. And then met the ladies, and were showed the whole house
by Mr. Marriott; which is indeed nobly furnished, particularly the
Queen’s bed, given her by the States of Holland; a looking-glass sent by
the Queen-mother from France, hanging in the Queen’s chamber, and many
brave pictures. So to Mr. Marriott’s, and there we rested ourselves and
drank. And so to barge again, and there we had good victuals and wine,
and were very merry; and got home about eight at night very well. So
my wife and I took leave of my Ladies, and home by a hackney-coach, the
easiest that ever I met with, and so to bed.
