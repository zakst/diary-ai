24th. Up very betimes, and did much business in my chamber. Then to
the office, where busy all the morning. At noon rose in the pleasantest
humour I have seen Sir W. Coventry and the whole board in this
twelvemonth from a pleasant crossing humour Sir W. Batten was in, he
being hungry, and desirous to be gone. Home, and Mr. Hunt come to dine
with me, but I was prevented dining till 4 o’clock by Sir H. Cholmly and
Sir J. Bankes’s coming in about some Tangier business. They gone I to
dinner, the others having dined. Mr. Sheply is also newly come out of
the country and come to see us, whom I am glad to see. He left all
well there; but I perceive under some discontent in my Lord’s behalfe,
thinking that he is under disgrace with the King; but he is not so at
all, as Sir G. Carteret assures me. They gone I to the office and did
business, and so in the evening abroad alone with my wife to Kingsland,
and so back again and to bed, my right eye continuing very ill of the
rheum, which hath troubled it four or five days.
