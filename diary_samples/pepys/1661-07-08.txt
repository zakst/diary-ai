8th, 9th, Loth, 11th, 12th, 13th. I fell to work, and my father to look
over my uncle’s papers and clothes, and continued all this week upon
that business, much troubled with my aunt’s base, ugly humours. We had
news of Tom Trice’s putting in a caveat against us, in behalf of his
mother, to whom my uncle hath not given anything, and for good reason
therein expressed, which troubled us also. But above all, our trouble
is to find that his estate appears nothing as we expected, and all the
world believes; nor his papers so well sorted as I would have had them,
but all in confusion, that break my brains to understand them. We missed
also the surrenders of his copyhold land, without which the land would
not come to us, but to the heir at law, so that what with this, and the
badness of the drink and the ill opinion I have of the meat, and the
biting of the gnats by night and my disappointment in getting home this
week, and the trouble of sorting all the papers, I am almost out of my
wits with trouble, only I appear the more contented, because I would not
have my father troubled. The latter end of the week Mr. Philips comes
home from London, and so we advised with him and have the best counsel
he could give us, but for all that we were not quiet in our minds.
