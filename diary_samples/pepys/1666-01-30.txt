30th. Lay long till Mr. Gawden was gone out being to take a little
journey. Up, and Creed and I some good discourse, but with some trouble
for the state of my Lord’s matters. After walking a turne or two in the
garden, and bid good morrow to Mr. Gawden’s sons, and sent my service to
the ladies, I took coach after Mr. Gawden’s, and home, finding the towne
keeping the day solemnly, it being the day of the King’s murther, and
they being at church, I presently into the church, thinking to see
Mrs. Lethulier or Batelier, but did not, and a dull sermon of our young
Lecturer, too bad. This is the first time I have been in this church
since I left London for the plague, and it frighted me indeed to go
through the church more than I thought it could have done, to see so
[many] graves lie so high upon the churchyards where people have been
buried of the plague. I was much troubled at it, and do not think to go
through it again a good while. So home to my wife, whom I find not well,
in bed, and it seems hath not been well these two days. She rose and we
to dinner, after dinner up to my chamber, where she entertained me with
what she hath lately bought of clothes for herself, and Damask linnen,
and other things for the house. I did give her a serious account how
matters stand with me, of favour with the King and Duke, and of
danger in reference to my Lord’s and Sir G. Carteret’s falls, and the
dissatisfaction I have heard the Duke of Albemarle hath acknowledged
to somebody, among other things, against my Lord Sandwich, that he did
bring me into the Navy against his desire and endeavour for another,
which was our doting foole Turner. Thence from one discourse to another,
and looking over my house, and other things I spent the day at home, and
at night betimes to bed. After dinner this day I went down by water to
Deptford, and fetched up what money there was of W. Howe’s contingencies
in the chest there, being L516 13s. 3d. and brought it home to dispose
of.
