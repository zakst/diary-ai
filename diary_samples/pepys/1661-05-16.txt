16th. Up early to see whether the work of my house be quite done, and I
found it to my mind. Staid at home all the morning, and about 2 o’clock
went in my velvet coat by water to the Savoy, and there, having staid a
good while, I was called into the Lords, and there, quite contrary to my
expectations, they did treat me very civilly, telling me that what they
had done was out of zeal to the King’s service, and that they would
joyne with the governors of the chest with all their hearts, since they
knew that there was any, which they did not before. I give them very
respectful answer and so went away to the Theatre, and there saw the
latter end of “The Mayd’s Tragedy,” which I never saw before, and
methinks it is too sad and melancholy. Thence homewards, and meeting Mr.
Creed I took him by water to the Wardrobe with me, and there we found
my Lord newly gone away with the Duke of Ormond and some others, whom
he had had to the collation; and so we, with the rest of the servants in
the hall, sat down and eat of the best cold meats that ever I eat on
in all my life. From thence I went home (Mr. Moore with me to the
waterside, telling me how kindly he is used by my Lord and my Lady since
his coming hither as a servant), and to bed.
