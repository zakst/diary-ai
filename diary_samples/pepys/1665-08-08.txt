8th. Up and to the office, where all the morning we sat. At noon I home
to dinner alone, and after dinner Bagwell’s wife waited at the door, and
went with me to my office.... So parted, and I to Sir W. Batten’s, and
there sat the most of the afternoon talking and drinking too much with
my Lord Bruncker, Sir G. Smith, G. Cocke and others very merry. I drunk
a little mixed, but yet more than I should do. So to my office a little,
and then to the Duke of Albemarle’s about some business. The streets
mighty empty all the way, now even in London, which is a sad sight. And
to Westminster Hall, where talking, hearing very sad stories from Mrs.
Mumford; among others, of Mrs. Michell’s son’s family. And poor Will,
that used to sell us ale at the Hall-door, his wife and three children
died, all, I think, in a day. So home through the City again, wishing I
may have taken no ill in going; but I will go, I think, no more thither.
Late at the office, and then home to supper, having taken a pullet
home with me, and then to bed. The news of De Kuyter’s coming home
is certain; and told to the great disadvantage of our fleete, and the
praise of De Kuyter; but it cannot be helped, nor do I know what to say
to it.
