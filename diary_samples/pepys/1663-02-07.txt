7th. Up and to my office, whither by agreement Mr. Coventry came
before the time of sitting to confer about preparing an account of the
extraordinary charge of the Navy since the Kingâ€™s coming, more than is
properly to be applied and called the Navy charge. So by and by we sat,
and so till noon. Then home to dinner, and in the afternoon some of us
met again upon something relating to the victualling, and thence to my
writing of letters late, and making my Alphabet to my new Navy book
very pretty. And so after writing to my father by the post about the
endeavour to come to a composition with my uncle, though a very bad one,
desiring him to be contented therewith, I went home to supper and to
bed.
