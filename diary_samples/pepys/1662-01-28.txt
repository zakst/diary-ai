28th. This morning (after my musique practice with Mr. Berkenshaw) with
my wife to the Paynterâ€™s, where we staid very late to have her picture
mended, which at last is come to be very like her, and I think well
done; but the Paynter, though a very honest man, I found to be very
silly as to matter of skill in shadows, for we were long in discourse,
till I was almost angry to hear him talk so simply. So home to dinner
and then to the office, and so home for all night.
