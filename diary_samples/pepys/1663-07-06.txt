6th. Up pretty early and to my office all the morning, writing out a
list of the King’s ships in my Navy collections with great pleasure. At
noon Creed comes to me, who tells me how well he has sped with Sir G.
Carteret after all our trouble, that he had his tallys up and all the
kind words possible from him, which I believe is out of an apprehension
what a fool he has made of himself hitherto in making so great a stop
therein. But I find, and so my Lord Sandwich may, that Sir G. Carteret
had a design to do him a disgrace, if he could possibly, otherwise he
would never have carried the business so far after that manner, but
would first have consulted my Lord and given him advice what to do
therein for his own honour, which he thought endangered. Creed dined
with me and then walked a while, and so away, and I to my office at
my morning’s work till dark night, and so with good content home. To
supper, a little musique, and then to bed.
