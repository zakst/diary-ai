5th. Up, and by water to White Hall, where we did much business before
the Duke of York, which being done, I away home by water again, and
there to my office till noon busy. At noon home, and Goodgroome dined
with us, who teaches my wife to sing. After dinner I did give him my
song, “Beauty retire,” which he has often desired of me, and without
flattery I think is a very good song. He gone, I to the office, and
there late, very busy doing much business, and then home to supper and
talk, and then scold with my wife for not reckoning well the times that
her musique master hath been with her, but setting down more than I am
sure, and did convince her, they had been with her, and in an ill humour
of anger with her to bed.
