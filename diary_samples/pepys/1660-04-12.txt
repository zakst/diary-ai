12th. This day, the weather being very bad, we had no strangers on
board. In the afternoon came the Vice-Admiral on board, with whom my
Lord consulted, and I sent a packet to London at night with several
letters to my friends, as to my wife about my getting of money for
her when she should need it, to Mr. Bowyer that he tell me when the
Messieurs of the offices be paid, to Mr. Moore about the business of my
office, and making even with him as to matter of money. At night after I
had despatched my letters, to bed.
