5th. Washing-day. My wife and I by water to Westminster. She to her
mother’s and I to Westminster Hall, where I found a full term, and here
I went to Will’s, and there found Shaw and Ashwell and another Bragrave
(who knew my mother wash-maid to my Lady Veere), who by cursing and
swearing made me weary of his company and so I went away. Into the Hall
and there saw my Lord Treasurer (who was sworn to-day at the Exchequer,
with a great company of Lords and persons of honour to attend him) go up
to the Treasury Offices, and take possession thereof; and also saw the
heads of Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton, set up upon the further end of
the Hall. Then at Mrs. Michell’s in the Hall met my wife and Shaw, and
she and I and Captain Murford to the Dog, and there I gave them some
wine, and after some mirth and talk (Mr. Langley coming in afterwards) I
went by coach to the play-house at the Theatre, our coach in King Street
breaking, and so took another. Here we saw Argalus and Parthenia, which
I lately saw, but though pleasant for the dancing and singing, I do not
find good for any wit or design therein. That done home by coach and to
supper, being very hungry for want of dinner, and so to bed.
