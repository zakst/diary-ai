14th. Up, and by water, stopping at Michell’s, and there saw Betty, but
could have no discourse with her, but there drank. To White Hall, and
there walked to St. James’s, where I find the Court mighty full, it
being the Duke or York’s birthday; and he mighty fine, and all the
musick, one after another, to my great content. Here I met with Sir
H. Cholmly; and he and I to walk, and to my Lord Barkeley’s new house;
there to see a new experiment of a cart, which; by having two little
wheeles fastened to the axle-tree, is said to make it go with half the
ease and more, than another cart but we did not see the trial made.
Thence I home, and after dinner to St. James’s, and there met my
brethren; but the Duke of York being gone out, and to-night being a play
there; and a great festival, we would not stay, but went all of us to
the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Faythful Shepherdess” again,
that we might hear the French Eunuch sing, which we did, to our great
content; though I do admire his action as much as his singing, being
both beyond all I ever saw or heard. Thence with W. Pen home, and there
to get my people to read, and to supper, and so to bed.
