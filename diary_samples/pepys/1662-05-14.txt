14th. All the morning at Westminster and elsewhere about business, and
dined at the Wardrobe; and after dinner, sat talking an hour or two
alone with my Lady. She is afeard that my Lady Castlemaine will keep
still with the King, and I am afeard she will not, for I love her well.
Thence to my brother’s, and finding him in a lie about the lining of my
new morning gown, saying that it was the same with the outside, I was
very angry with him and parted so. So home after an hour stay at Paul’s
Churchyard, and there came Mr. Morelock of Chatham, and brought me a
stately cake, and I perceive he has done the same to the rest, of which
I was glad; so to bed.
