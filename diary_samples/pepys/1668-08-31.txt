31st. Up, and to my office, there to set my journal for all the last
week, and so by water to Westminster to the Exchequer, and thence to the
Swan, and there drank and did baiser la fille there, and so to the New
Exchange and paid for some things, and so to Hercules Pillars,’ and
there dined all alone, while I sent my shoe to have the heel fastened at
Wotton’s, and thence to White Hall to the Treasury chamber, where did
a little business, and thence to the Duke of York’s playhouse and there
met my wife and Deb. and Mary Mercer and Batelier, where also W. Hewer
was, and saw “Hamlet,” which we have not seen this year before, or more;
and mightily pleased with it; but, above all, with Betterton, the
best part I believe, that ever man acted. Thence to the Fayre, and saw
“Polichinelle,” and so home, and after a little supper to bed. This
night lay the first night in Deb.’s chamber, which is now hung with that
that hung our great chamber, and is now a very handsome room. This day
Mrs. Batelier did give my wife a mighty pretty Spaniel bitch [Flora],
which she values mightily, and is pretty; but as a new comer, I cannot
be fond of her.
