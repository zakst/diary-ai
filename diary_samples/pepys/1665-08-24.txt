24th. Up betimes to my office, where my clerks with me, and very busy
all the morning writing letters. At noon down to Sir J. Minnes and Lord
Bruncker to Greenwich to sign some of the Treasurer’s books, and there
dined very well; and thence to look upon our rooms again at the King’s
house, which are not yet ready for us. So home and late writing letters,
and so, weary with business, home to supper and to bed.
