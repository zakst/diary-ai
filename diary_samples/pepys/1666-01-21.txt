21st (Lordâ€™s day). Lay almost till noon merrily and with pleasure
talking with my wife in bed. Then up looking about my house, and the
roome which my wife is dressing up, having new hung our bedchamber
with blue, very handsome. After dinner to my Tangier accounts and there
stated them against to-morrow very distinctly for the Lords to see who
meet tomorrow, and so to supper and to bed.
