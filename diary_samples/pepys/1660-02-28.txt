28th. Called up at two in the morning for letters for my Lord from
the Duke of York, but I went to bed again till 5. Trimmed early this
morning. This morning the Captain did call over all the men in the ship
(not the boys), and give every one of them a ducat of the King’s money
that he gave the ship, and the officers according to their quality. I
received in the Captain’s cabin, for my share, sixty ducats. The rest of
the morning busy writing letters. So was my Lord that he would not come
to dinner. After dinner to write again in order to sending to London,
but my Lord did not finish his, so we did not send to London to-day. A
great part of the afternoon at nine-pins with my Lord and Mr. Hetley.
I lost about 4s. Supped with my Lord, and after that to bed. At night I
had a strange dream of--myself, which I really did, and having kicked my
clothes off, I got cold; and found myself all much wet in the morning,
and had a great deal of pain... which made me very melancholy.
