22nd (Lord’s day). Up, leaving my wife in bed, being sick of her months,
and to church. Thence home, and in my wife’s chamber dined very merry,
discoursing, among other things, of a design I have come in my head this
morning at church of making a match between Mrs. Betty Pickering and
Mr. Hill, my friend the merchant, that loves musique and comes to me
a’Sundays, a most ingenious and sweet-natured and highly accomplished
person. I know not how their fortunes may agree, but their disposition
and merits are much of a sort, and persons, though different, yet
equally, I think, acceptable. After dinner walked to Westminster, and
after being at the Abbey and heard a good anthem well sung there, I as
I had appointed to the Trumpett, there expecting when Jane Welsh should
come, but anon comes a maid of the house to tell me that her mistress
and master would not let her go forth, not knowing of my being here, but
to keep her from her sweetheart. So being defeated, away by coach home,
and there spent the evening prettily in discourse with my wife and
Mercer, and so to supper, prayers, and to bed.
