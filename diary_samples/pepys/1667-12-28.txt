28th. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning, at noon home,
and there to dinner with my clerks and Mr. Pelting, and had a very good
dinner, among others a haunch of venison boiled, and merry we were, and
I rose soon from dinner, and with my wife and girle to the King’s house,
and there saw “The Mad Couple,” which is but an ordinary play; but only
Nell’s and Hart’s mad parts are most excellently done, but especially
hers: which makes it a miracle to me to think how ill she do any serious
part, as, the other day, just like a fool or changeling; and, in a mad
part, do beyond all imitation almost. [It pleased us mightily to see
the natural affection of a poor woman, the mother of one of the children
brought on the stage: the child crying, she by force got upon the stage,
and took up her child and carried it away off of the stage from Hart.]
Many fine faces here to-day. Thence home, and there to the office late,
and then home to supper and to bed. I am told to-day, which troubles me,
that great complaint is made upon the ‘Change, among our merchants, that
the very Ostend little pickaroon men-of-war do offer violence to our
merchant-men, and search them, beat our masters, and plunder them, upon
pretence of carrying Frenchmen’s goods. Lord! what a condition are we
come to, and that so soon after a war!
