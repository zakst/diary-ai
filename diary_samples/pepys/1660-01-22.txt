22d. To my Lord, where much business. With him to White Hall, where the
Duke of York not being up, we walked a good while in the Shield Gallery.
Mr. Hill (who for these two or three days hath constantly attended my
Lord) told me of an offer of L500 for a Baronet’s dignity, which I told
my Lord of in the balcone in this gallery, and he said he would think of
it. I to my Lord’s and gave order for horses to be got to draw my Lord’s
great coach to Mr. Crew’s. Mr. Morrice the upholsterer came himself
to-day to take notice what furniture we lack for our lodgings at
Whitehall. My dear friend Mr. Fuller of Twickenham and I dined alone at
the Sun Tavern, where he told me how he had the grant of being Dean
of St. Patrick’s, in Ireland; and I told him my condition, and both
rejoiced one for another. Thence to my Lord’s, and had the great coach
to Brigham’s, who went with me to the Half Moon, and gave me a can of
good julep, and told me how my Lady Monk deals with him and others
for their places, asking him L500, though he was formerly the King’s
coach-maker, and sworn to it. My Lord abroad, and I to my house and
set things in a little order there. So with Mr. Moore to my father’s, I
staying with Mrs. Turner who stood at her door as I passed. Among other
things she told me for certain how my old Lady Middlesex----herself the
other day in the presence of the King, and people took notice of it.
Thence called at my father’s, and so to Mr. Crew’s, where Mr. Hetley had
sent a letter for me, and two pair of silk stockings, one for W. Howe,
and the other for me. To Sir H. Wright’s to my Lord, where he, was, and
took direction about business, and so by link home about 11 o’clock. To
bed, the first time since my coming from sea, in my own house, for which
God be praised.
