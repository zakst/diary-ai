26th. In the morning to the Temple to my cozen Roger, who now desires
that I would excuse him from arbitrating, he not being able to stand for
me as he would do, without appearing too high against my uncle Thomas,
which will raise his clamour. With this I am very well pleased, for
I did desire it, and so I shall choose other counsel. Thence home,
he being busy that I could not speak more with him. All day long till
twelve o’clock at night getting my house in order, my wife putting up
the red hangings and bed in her woman’s chamber, and I my books and all
other matters in my chamber and study, which is now very pretty. So to
bed.
