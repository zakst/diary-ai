17th. To the Duke’s to-day, but he is gone a-hunting, and therefore I
to my Lord Sandwich’s, and having spoke a little with him about his
businesses, I to Westminster Hall and there staid long doing many
businesses, and so home by the Temple and other places doing the like,
and at home I found my wife dressing by appointment by her woman--[Mrs.
Gosnell.]--that I think is to be, and her other sister being here to-day
with her and my wife’s brother, I took Mr. Creed, that came to dine,
to an ordinary behind the Change, and there dined together, and after
dinner home and there spent an hour or two till almost dark, talking
with my wife, and making Mrs. Gosnell sing; and then, there being no
coach to be got, by water to White Hall; but Gosnell not being willing
to go through bridge, we were forced to land and take water, again, and
put her and her sister ashore at the Temple. I am mightily pleased with
her humour and singing. At White Hall by appointment, Mr. Creed carried
my wife and I to the Cockpitt, and we had excellent places, and saw the
King, Queen, Duke of Monmouth, his son, and my Lady Castlemaine, and all
the fine ladies; and “The Scornfull Lady,” well performed. They had done
by eleven o’clock, and it being fine moonshine, we took coach and home,
but could wake nobody at my house, and so were fain to have my boy get
through one of the windows, and so opened the door and called up the
maids, and went to supper and to bed, my mind being troubled at what
my wife tells me, that her woman will not come till she hears from her
mother, for I am so fond of her that I am loth now not to have her,
though I know it will be a great charge to me which I ought to avoid,
and so will make it up in other things. So to bed.
