June 1st. Being prevented yesterday in meeting by reason of the fast
day, we met to-day all the morning. At noon I and my father, wife and
sister, dined at Aunt Wight’s here hard by at Mr. Woolly’s, upon sudden
warning, they being to go out of town to-morrow. Here dined the faire
Mrs. Margaret Wight, who is a very fine lady, but the cast of her eye,
got only by an ill habit, do her much wrong and her hands are bad;
but she hath the face of a noble Roman lady. After dinner my uncle
and Woolly and I out into their yarde, to talke about what may be done
hereafter to all our profits by prizegoods, which did give us reason to
lament the losse of the opportunity of the last yeare, which, if we were
as wise as we are now, and at the peaceable end of all those troubles
that we met with, all might have been such a hit as will never come
again in this age, and so I do really believe it. Thence home to my
office and there did much business, and at night home to my father to
supper and to bed.
