13th. Lay long in bed, troubled a little with wind, but not much. So to
the office, and there all the morning. At noon to Sheriff Watermanâ€™s
to dinner, all of us men of the office in towne, and our wives, my Lady
Carteret and daughters, and Ladies Batten, Pen, and my wife, &c., and
very good cheer we had and merry; musique at and after dinner, and a
fellow danced a jigg; but when the company begun to dance, I came away
lest I should be taken out; and God knows how my wife carried herself,
but I left her to try her fortune. So home, and late at the office, and
then home to supper and to bed.
