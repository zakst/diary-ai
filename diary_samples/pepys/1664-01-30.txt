30th. Up, and a sorry sermon of a young fellow I knew at Cambridge; but
the day kept solemnly for the King’s murder, and all day within doors
making up my Brampton papers, and in the evening Mr. Commander came and
we made perfect and signed and sealed my last will and testament, which
is so to my mind, and I hope to the liking of God Almighty, that I take
great joy in myself that it is done, and by that means my mind in a good
condition of quiett. At night to supper and to bed. This evening, being
in a humour of making all things even and clear in the world, I tore
some old papers; among others, a romance which (under the title of “Love
a Cheate “) I begun ten years ago at Cambridge; and at this time reading
it over to-night I liked it very well, and wondered a little at myself
at my vein at that time when I wrote it, doubting that I cannot do so
well now if I would try.
