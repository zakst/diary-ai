28th. Up, and to the office, where all the afternoon, also after dinner,
and there late dispatching much business, and then home to supper with
my wife, and to get her to read to me, and here I did find that Mr.
Sheres hath, beyond his promise, not only got me a candlestick made me,
after a form he remembers to have seen in Spain, for keeping the light
from oneâ€™s eyes, but hath got it done in silver very neat, and designs
to give it me, in thanks for my paying him his L100 in money, for his
service at Tangier, which was ordered him; but I do intend to force him
to make me [pay] for it. But I yet, without his direction, cannot tell
how it is to be made use of. So after a little reading to bed.
