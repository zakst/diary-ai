17th. Up and to my office, and there all the morning mighty busy, and
taking upon me to tell the Comptroller how ill his matters were done,
and I think indeed if I continue thus all the business of the office
will come upon me whether I will or no. At noon to the â€˜Change, and then
home with Creed to dinner, and thence I to the office, where close at it
all the afternoon till 12 at night, and then home to supper and to bed.
This day I received from Mr. Foley, but for me to pay for it, if I like
it, an iron chest, having now received back some money I had laid out
for the King, and I hope to have a good sum of money by me, thereby, in
a few days, I think above L800. But when I come home at night, I could
not find the way to open it; but, which is a strange thing, my little
girle Susan could carry it alone from one table clear from the ground
and set upon another, when neither I nor anyone in my house but Jane the
cook-mayde could do it.
