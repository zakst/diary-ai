10th. At the office all the morning, and the afternoon among my workmen
with great pleasure, because being near an end of their work. This
afternoon came Mr. Blackburn and Creed to see me, and I took them to the
Dolphin, and there drank a great deal of Rhenish wine with them and so
home, having some talk with Mr. Blackburn about his kinsman my Will,
and he did give me good satisfaction in that it is his desire that his
kinsman should do me all service, and that he would give him the best
counsel he could to make him good. Which I begin of late to fear that
he will not because of the bad company that I find that he do begin to
take. This afternoon Mr. Hater received for me the L225 due upon Mr.
Creedâ€™s bill in which I am concerned so much, which do make me very
glad. At night to Sir W. Batten and sat a while. So to bed.
