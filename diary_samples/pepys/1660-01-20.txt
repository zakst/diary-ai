20th. Up by 4 in the morning to write letters to sea and a commission
for him that Murford solicited for. Called on by Captain Sparling, who
did give me my Dutch money again, and so much as he had changed into
English money, by which my mind was eased of a great deal of trouble.
Some other sea captains. I did give them a good morning draught, and so
to my Lord (who lay long in bed this day, because he came home late from
supper with the King). With my Lord to the Parliament House, and, after
that, with him to General Monk’s, where he dined at the Cock-pit. I home
and dined with my wife, now making all things ready there again. Thence
to my Lady Pickering, who did give me the best intelligence about the
Wardrobe. Afterwards to the Cockpit to my Lord with Mr. Townsend, one
formerly and now again to be employed as Deputy of the Wardrobe. Thence
to the Admiralty, and despatched away Mr. Cooke to sea; whose business
was a letter from my Lord about Mr. G. Montagu to be chosen as
a Parliament-man in my Lord’s room at Dover;’ and another to the
Vice-Admiral to give my Lord a constant account of all things in the
fleet, merely that he may thereby keep up his power there; another
letter to Captn. Cuttance to send the barge that brought the King on
shore, to Hinchingbroke by Lynne. To my own house, meeting G. Vines,
and drank with him at Charing Cross, now the King’s Head Tavern. With
my wife to my father’s, where met with Swan,--[William Swan is called
a fanatic and a very rogue in other parts of the Diary.]--an old
hypocrite, and with him, his friend and my father, and my cozen Scott to
the Bear Tavern. To my father’s and to bed.
