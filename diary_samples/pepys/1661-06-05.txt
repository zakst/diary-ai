had good sport, and afterwards went in and drank and talked. So home Sir
William and I, and it being very hot weather I took my flageolette and
played upon the leads in the garden, where Sir W. Pen came out in
his shirt into his leads, and there we staid talking and singing, and

     commerce, however, is from the tunny, a large fish of passage which
     is common in the Mediterranean.  The best kind comes from Tunis.”
      --Smyth’s Sailor’s Word-Book.  Botargo was chiefly used to promote
     drinking by causing thirst, and Rabelais makes Gargantua eat it.]

bed, very near fuddled.
