morning. So dined at home, and then to my office again, causing the
model hanging in my chamber to be taken down and hung up in my office,
for fear of being spoilt by the workmen, and for my own convenience

     Vere, Earl of Oxford, and Barbara, Countess of Suffolk, first Lady
     of the Bedchamber to the Queen and Lady Castlemaine’s aunt.  The
