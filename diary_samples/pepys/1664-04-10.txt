10th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, and then up and my wife dressed
herself, it being Easter day, but I not being so well as to go out, she,
though much against her will, staid at home with me; for she had put
on her new best gowns, which indeed is very fine now with the lace; and
this morning her taylor brought home her other new laced silks gowns
with a smaller lace, and new petticoats, I bought the other day both
very pretty. We spent the day in pleasant talks and company one with
another, reading in Dr. Fuller’s book what he says of the family of the
Cliffords and Kingsmills, and at night being myself better than I was
by taking a glyster, which did carry away a great deal of wind, I after
supper at night went to bed and slept well.
