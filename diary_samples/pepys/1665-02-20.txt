20th. Up, and with Sir J. Minnes to attend the Duke, and then we back
again and rode into the beginning of my Lord Chancellor’s new
house, near St. James’s; which common people have already called
Dunkirke-house, from their opinion of his having a good bribe for the
selling of that towne. And very noble I believe it will be. Near that is
my Lord Barkeley beginning another on one side, and Sir J. Denham on the
other. Thence I to the House of Lords and spoke with my Lord Bellasses,
and so to the ‘Change, and there did business, and so to the Sun
taverne, haling in the morning had some high words with Sir J. Lawson
about his sending of some bayled goods to Tangier, wherein the truth is
I did not favour him, but being conscious that some of my profits may
come out by some words that fell from him, and to be quiet, I have
accommodated it. Here we dined merry; but my club and the rest come
to 7s. 6d., which was too much. Thence to the office, and there found
Bagwell’s wife, whom I directed to go home, and I would do her business,
which was to write a letter to my Lord Sandwich for her husband’s
advance into a better ship as there should be occasion. Which I did, and
by and by did go down by water to Deptford, and then down further, and
so landed at the lower end of the town, and it being dark ‘entrer en
la maison de la femme de Bagwell’, and there had ‘sa compagnie’, though
with a great deal of difficulty, ‘neanmoins en fin j’avais ma volont
d’elle’, and being sated therewith, I walked home to Redriffe, it being
now near nine o’clock, and there I did drink some strong waters and eat
some bread and cheese, and so home. Where at my office my wife comes
and tells me that she hath hired a chamber mayde, one of the prettiest
maydes that ever she saw in her life, and that she is really jealous
of me for her, but hath ventured to hire her from month to month, but I
think she means merrily. So to supper and to bed.
