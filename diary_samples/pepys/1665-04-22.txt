22nd. Up, and Mr. Caesar, my boyâ€™s lute-master, being come betimes to
teach him, I did speak with him seriously about the boy, what my mind
was, if he did not look after his lute and singing that I would turn him
away; which I hope will do some good upon the boy. All the morning busy
at the office. At noon dined at home, and then to the office again very
busy till very late, and so home to supper and to bed. My wife making
great preparation to go to Court to Chappell to-morrow. This day I have
newes from Mr. Coventry that the fleete is sailed yesterday from Harwich
to the coast of Holland to see what the Dutch will do. God go along with
them!
