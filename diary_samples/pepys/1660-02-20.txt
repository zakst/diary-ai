20th. In the morning at my lute. Then to my office, where my partner
and I made even our balance. Took him home to dinner with me, where my
brother John came to dine with me. After dinner I took him to my study
at home and at my Lord’s, and gave him some books and other things
against his going to Cambridge. After he was gone I went forth to
Westminster Hall, where I met with Chetwind, Simons, and Gregory. And
with them to Marsh’s at Whitehall to drink, and staid there a pretty
while reading a pamphlet well writ and directed to General Monk, in
praise of the form of monarchy which was settled here before the wars.

     [This pamphlet is among the Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts
     (British Museum), and dated in MS.  this same day, February 20th--
     “A Plea for Limited Monarchy as it was established in this Nation
     before the late War.  In an Humble Address to his Excellency General
     Monck.  By a Zealot for the good old Laws of his Country, before any
     Faction or Caprice, with additions.”  “An Eccho to the Plea for
     Limited Monarchy, &c.,” was published soon afterwards.]

They told me how the Speaker Lenthall do refuse to sign the writs for
choice of new members in the place of the excluded; and by that means
the writs could not go out to-day. In the evening Simons and I to the
Coffee Club, where nothing to do only I heard Mr. Harrington, and my
Lord of Dorset and another Lord, talking of getting another place as the
Cockpit, and they did believe it would come to something. After a small
debate upon the question whether learned or unlearned subjects are the
best the Club broke up very poorly, and I do not think they will meet
any more. Hence with Vines, &c. to Will’s, and after a pot or two home,
and so to bed.
