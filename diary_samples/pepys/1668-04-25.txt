25th. Up, and with Sir J. Minnes to my Lord Brouncker, and with him all
of us to my Lord Ashly to satisfy him about the reason of what we do
or have done in the business of the tradesmen’s certificates, which he
seems satisfied with, but is not, but I believe we have done what we can
justify, and he hath done what he cannot in stopping us to grant them,
and I believe it will come into Parliament and make trouble. So home and
there at the office all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and thence
after dinner to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there saw “Sir
Martin Marr-all,” which, the more I see, the more I like, and thence to
Westminster Hall, and there met with Roger Pepys; and he tells me that
nothing hath lately passed about my Lord Sandwich, but only Sir Robert
Carr did speak hardly of him. But it is hoped that nothing will be
done more, this meeting of Parliament, which the King did, by a message
yesterday, declare again, should rise the 4th of May, and then only
adjourne for three months: and this message being only adjournment, did
please them mightily, for they are desirous of their power mightily.
Thence homeward by the Coffee House in Covent Garden, thinking to have
met Harris here but could not, and so home, and there, after my letters,
I home to have my hair cut by my sister Michell and her husband, and so
to bed. This day I did first put off my waste-coate, the weather being
very hot, but yet lay in it at night, and shall, for a little time.
