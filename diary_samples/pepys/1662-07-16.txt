16th. In the morning I found all my ceilings, spoiled with rain last
night, so that I fear they must be all new whited when the work is done.
Made me ready and to my office, and by and by came Mr. Moore to me, and
so I went home and consulted about drawing up a fair state of all
my Lord’s accounts, which being settled, he went away, and I fell to
writing of it very neatly, and it was very handsome and concisely done.
At noon to my Lord’s with it, but found him at dinner, and some great
company with him, Mr. Edward Montagu and his brother, and Mr. Coventry,
and after dinner he went out with them, and so I lost my labour; but
dined with Mr. Moore and the people below, who after dinner fell to talk
of Portugall rings, and Captain Ferrers offered five or six to sell, and
I seeming to like a ring made of a coco-nutt with a stone done in it,
he did offer and would give it me. By and by we went to Mr. Creed’s
lodging, and there got a dish or two of sweetmeats, and I seeing a very
neat leaden standish to carry papers, pen, and ink in when one travels
I also got that of him, and that done I went home by water and to finish
some of my Lord’s business, and so early to bed. This day I was told
that my Lady Castlemaine (being quite fallen out with her husband) did
yesterday go away from him, with all her plate, jewels, and other best
things; and is gone to Richmond to a brother of her’s; which, I am apt
to think, was a design to get out of town, that the King might come at
her the better. But strange it is how for her beauty I am willing to
construe all this to the best and to pity her wherein it is to her hurt,
though I know well enough she is a whore.
