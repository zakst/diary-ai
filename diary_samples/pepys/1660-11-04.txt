4th (Lord’s day). In the morn to our own church, where Mr. Mills did
begin to nibble at the Common Prayer, by saying “Glory be to the Father,
&c.” after he had read the two psalms; but the people had been so little
used to it, that they could not tell what to answer. This declaration of
the King’s do give the Presbyterians some satisfaction, and a pretence
to read the Common Prayer, which they would not do before because of
their former preaching against it. After dinner to Westminster, where I
went to my Lord’s, and having spoke with him, I went to the Abbey, where
the first time that ever I heard the organs in a cathedral! Thence to
my Lord’s, where I found Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and with him and Mr.
Sheply, in our way calling at the Bell to see the seven Flanders mares
that my Lord has bought lately, where we drank several bottles of Hull
ale. Much company I found to come to her, and cannot wonder at it, for
she is very pretty and wanton. Hence to my father’s, where I found my
mother in greater and greater pain of the stone. I staid long and drank
with them, and so home and to bed. My wife seemed very pretty to-day, it
being the first time I had given her leave to wear a black patch.
