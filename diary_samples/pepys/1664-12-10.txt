10th. Lay long, at which I am ashamed, because of so many people
observing it that know not how late I sit up, and for fear of Sir W.
Batten’s speaking of it to others, he having staid for me a good while.
At the office all the morning, where comes my Lord Brunkard with his
patent in his hand, and delivered it to Sir J. Minnes and myself, we
alone being there all the day, and at noon I in his coach with him to
the ‘Change, where he set me down; a modest civil person he seems to be,
but wholly ignorant in the business of the Navy as possible, but I hope
to make a friend of him, being a worthy man. Thence after hearing the
great newes of so many Dutchmen being brought in to Portsmouth and
elsewhere, which it is expected will either put them upon present
revenge or despair, I with Sir W. Rider and Cutler to dinner all alone
to the Great James, where good discourse, and, I hope, occasion of
getting something hereafter. After dinner to White Hall to the Fishery,
where the Duke was with us. So home, and late at my office, writing many
letters, then home to supper and to bed. Yesterday come home, and this
night I visited Sir W. Pen, who dissembles great respect and love to me,
but I understand him very well. Major Holmes is come from Guinny, and is
now at Plymouth with great wealth, they say.
