7th. This morning the judge Advocate Fowler came to see me, and he and
I sat talking till it was time to go to the office. To the office and
there staid till past 12 o’clock, and so I left the Comptroller and
Surveyor and went to Whitehall to my Lord’s, where I found my Lord gone
this morning to Huntingdon, as he told me yesterday he would. I staid
and dined with my Lady, there being Laud the page’s mother’ there, and
dined also with us, and seemed to have been a very pretty woman and of
good discourse. Before dinner I examined Laud in his Latin and found him
a very pretty boy and gone a great way in Latin. After dinner I took a
box of some things of value that my Lord had left for me to carry to the
Exchequer, which I did, and left them with my Brother Spicer, who also
had this morning paid L1000 for me by appointment to Sir R. Parkhurst.
So to the Privy Seal, where I signed a deadly number of pardons, which
do trouble me to get nothing by. Home by water, and there was much
pleased to see that my little room is likely to come to be finished
soon. I fell a-reading Fuller’s History of Abbys, and my wife in Great
Cyrus till twelve at night, and so to bed.
