26th. Up early. This being, by God’s great blessing, the fourth solemn
day of my cutting for the stone this day four years, and am by God’s
mercy in very good health, and like to do well, the Lord’s name be
praised for it. To the office and Sir G. Carteret’s all the morning
about business. At noon come my good guests, Madame Turner, The., and
Cozen Norton, and a gentleman, one Mr. Lewin of the King’s Life-Guard;
by the same token he told us of one of his fellows killed this morning
in a duel. I had a pretty dinner for them, viz., a brace of stewed
carps, six roasted chickens, and a jowl of salmon, hot, for the first
course; a tanzy

     [Tansy (tanacetum), a herb from which puddings were made.  Hence any
     pudding of the kind.  Selden (“Table Talk”) says: “Our tansies at
     Easter have reference to the bitter herbs.”  See in Wordsworth’s
     “University Life in the Eighteenth Century” recipes for “an apple
     tansey,” “a bean tansey,” and “a gooseberry tansey.”--M. B.]

and two neats’ tongues, and cheese the second; and were very merry all
the afternoon, talking and singing and piping upon the flageolette. In
the evening they went with great pleasure away, and I with great content
and my wife walked half an hour in the garden, and so home to supper and
to bed. We had a man-cook to dress dinner to-day, and sent for Jane to
help us, and my wife and she agreed at L3 a year (she would not serve
under) till both could be better provided, and so she stays with us, and
I hope we shall do well if poor Sarah were but rid of her ague.
