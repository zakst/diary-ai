30th. Up betimes and by coach to my Lord Sandwich, who I met going out,
and he did aske me how his cozen, my wife; did, the first time he hath
done so since his being offended, and, in my conscience, he would be
glad to be free with me again, but he knows not how to begin. So he went
out, and I through the garden to Mr. Coventry, where I saw Mr. Ch. Pett
bringing him a modell, and indeed it is a pretty one, for a New Year’s
gift; but I think the work not better done than mine. With him by coach
to London, with good and friendly discourse of business and against Sir
W. Batten and his foul dealings. So leaving him at the Guiny House I to
the Coffee House, whither came Mr. Grant and Sir W. Petty, with whom
I talked, and so did many, almost all the house there, about his new
vessel, wherein he did give me such satisfaction in every point that I
am almost confident she will prove an admirable invention. So home to
dinner, and after being upon the ‘Change awhile I dined with my wife,
who took physique to-day, and so to my office, and there all the
afternoon till late at night about office business, and so to supper and
to bed.
