10th. Up and to the office, where we sat till noon, and then to the
Exchange, where spoke with several and had my head casting about how to
get a penny and I hope I shall, and then hone, and there Mr. Moore by
appointment dined with me, and after dinner all the afternoon till night
drawing a bond and release against to-morrow for T. Trice, and I to come
to a conclusion in which I proceed with great fear and jealousy, knowing
him to be a rogue and one that I fear has at this time got too great
a hank--[hold]--over me by the neglect of my lawyers. But among other
things I am come to an end with Mr. Moore for a L32, a good while lying
in my hand of my Lord Privy Seal’s which he for the odd L7 do give me a
bond to secure me against, and so I got L25 clear. Then, he being
gone, to the office and there late setting down yesterday’s remarkable
discourses, and so home and to supper, late, and to bed. The Queene, I
hear, is now very well again, and that she hath bespoke herself a new
gowne.
