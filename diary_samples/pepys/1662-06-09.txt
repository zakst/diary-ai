9th. Early up and at the office with Mr. Hater, making my alphabet of
contracts, upon the dispatch of which I am now very intent, for that
I am resolved much to enquire into the price of commodities. Dined at
home, and after dinner to Greatorexâ€™s, and with him and another stranger
to the Tavern, but I drank no wine. He recommended Bond, of our end of
the town, to teach me to measure timber, and some other things that I
would learn, in order to my office. Thence back again to the office,
and there T. Hater and I did make an end of my alphabet, which did much
please me. So home to supper and to bed.
