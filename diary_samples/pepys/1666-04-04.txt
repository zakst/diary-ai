4th. Up, and with Sir W. Pen in his coach to White Hall, in his way
talking simply and fondly as he used to do, but I find myself to slight
him and his simple talke, I thank God, and that my condition will enable
me to do it. Thence, after doing our business with the Duke of Yorke,
with Captain Cocke home to the ‘Change in his coach. He promises me
presently a dozen of silver salts, and proposes a business for which he
hath promised Mrs. Williams for my Lord Bruncker a set of plate shall
cost him L500 and me the like, which will be a good business indeed.
After done several businesses at the ‘Change I home, and being washing
day dined upon cold meate, and so abroad by coach to Hales’s, and there
sat till night, mightily pleased with my picture, which is now almost
finished. So by coach home, it being the fast day and to my chamber and
so after supper to bed, consulting how to send my wife into the country
to advise about Pall’s marriage, which I much desire, and my father too,
and two or three offers are now in hand.
