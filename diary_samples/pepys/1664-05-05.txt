5th. Up betimes to my office, busy, and so abroad to change some plate
for my father to send to-day by the carrier to Brampton, but I observe
and do fear it may be to my wrong that I change spoons of my uncle
Robert’s into new and set a P upon them that thereby I cannot claim them
hereafter, as it was my brother Tom’s practice. However, the matter of
this is not great, and so I did it. So to the ‘Change, and meeting Sir
W. Warren, with him to a taverne, and there talked, as we used to do, of
the evils the King suffers in our ordering of business in the Navy, as
Sir W. Batten now forces us by his knavery. So home to dinner, and to
the office, where all the afternoon, and thence betimes home, my eyes
beginning every day to grow less and less able to bear with long reading
or writing, though it be by daylight; which I never observed till now.
So home to my wife, and after supper to bed.
