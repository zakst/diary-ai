26th. Lay long with pleasure, prating with my wife, and then up, and I a
little to the Office, and my head busy setting some papers and accounts
to rights, which being long neglected because of my eyes will take me
up much time and care to do, but it must be done. So home at noon to
dinner, and then abroad with my wife to a play, at the Duke of York’s
house, the house full of ordinary citizens. The play was “Women
Pleased,” which we had never seen before; and, though but indifferent,
yet there is a good design for a good play. So home, and there to talk,
and my wife to read to me, and so to bed.
