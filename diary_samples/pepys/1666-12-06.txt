6th. Up, but very good friends with her before I rose, and so to the
office, where we sat all the forenoon, and then home to dinner, where
Harman dined with us, and great sport to hear him tell how Will Joyce
grows rich by the custom of the City coming to his end of the towne, and
how he rants over his brother and sister for their keeping an Inne,
and goes thither and tears like a prince, calling him hosteller and
his sister hostess. Then after dinner, my wife and brother, in another
habit; go out to see a play; but I am not to take notice that I know
of my brotherâ€™s going. So I to the office, where very busy till late at
night, and then home. My wife not pleased with the play, but thinks that
it is because she is grown more critical than she used to be, but my
brother she says is mighty taken with it. So to supper and to bed. This
day, in the Gazette, is the whole story of defeating the Scotch rebells,
and of the creation of the Duke of Cambridge, Knight of the Garter.
