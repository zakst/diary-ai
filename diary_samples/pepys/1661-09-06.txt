6th. This morning my uncle Fenner by appointment came and drank his
morning draft with me, and from thence he and I go to see my aunt Kite
(my wife holding her resolution to go this morning as she resolved
yesterday, and though there could not be much hurt in it, yet my own
jealousy put a hundred things into my mind, which did much trouble me
all day), whom we found in bed and not like to live as we think, and she
told us her mind was that if she should die she should give all she had
to her daughter, only L5 apiece to her second husband’s children, in
case they live to come out of their apprenticeships, and that if her
daughter should die before marrying, then L10 to be divided between
Sarah Kite’s children and the rest as her own daughter shall dispose of
it, and this I set down that I may be able to swear in case there should
be occasion. From thence to an alehouse while it rained, which kept us
there I think above two hours, and at last we were fain to go through
the rainy street home, calling on his sister Utbeck and drank there.
Then I home to dinner all alone, and thence my mind being for my
wife’s going abroad much troubled and unfit for business, I went to the
Theatre, and saw “Elder Brother” ill acted; that done, meeting here with
Sir G. Askew, Sir Theophilus Jones, and another Knight, with Sir W.
Pen, we to the Ship tavern, and there staid and were merry till late
at night, and so got a coach, and Sir Wm. and I home, where my wife had
been long come home, but I seemed very angry, as indeed I am, and did
not all night show her any countenance, neither before nor in bed, and
so slept and rose discontented.
