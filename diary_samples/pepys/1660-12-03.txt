3rd. This morning I took a resolution to rise early in the morning, and
so I rose by candle, which I have not done all this winter, and spent my
morning in fiddling till time to go to the office, where Sir G. Carteret
did begin again discourse on Mr. Holland’s proposition, which the King
do take very ill, and so Sir George in lieu of that do propose that the
seamen should have half in ready money and tickets for the other half,
to be paid in three months after, which we judge to be very practicable.
After office home to dinner, where come in my cozen Snow by chance, and
I had a very good capon to dinner. So to the office till night, and so
home, and then come Mr. Davis, of Deptford (the first time that ever
he was at my house), and after him Mons. L’Impertinent, who is to go to
Ireland to-morrow, and so came to take his leave of me. They both found
me under the barber’s hand; but I had a bottle of good sack in the
house, and so made them very welcome. Mr. Davis sat with me a good while
after the other was gone, talking of his hard usage and of the endeavour
to put him out of his place in the time of the late Commissioners, and
he do speak very highly of their corruption. After he was gone I fell
a reading ‘Cornelianum dolium’ till 11 o’clock at night with great
pleasure, and after that to bed.
