7th. Up and to my office, where busy, and by and by comes Sir W. Warren
and old Mr. Bond in order to the resolving me some questions about masts
and their proportions, but he could say little to me to my satisfaction,
and so I held him not long but parted. So to my office busy till noon
and then to the ‘Change, where high talke of the Dutch’s protest against
our Royall Company in Guinny, and their granting letters of marke
against us there, and every body expects a warr, but I hope it will not
yet be so, nor that this is true. Thence to dinner, where my wife got
me a pleasant French fricassee of veal for dinner, and thence to
the office, where vexed to see how Sir W. Batten ordered things this
afternoon (vide my office book, for about this time I have begun, my
notions and informations encreasing now greatly every day, to enter all
occurrences extraordinary in my office in a book by themselves), and so
in the evening after long discourse and eased my mind by discourse with
Sir W. Warren, I to my business late, and so home to supper and to bed.
