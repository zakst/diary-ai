23rd. All the morning with Mr. Berkenshaw, and after him Mr. Moore in
discourse of business, and in the afternoon by coach by invitacon to
my uncle Fenner’s, where I found his new wife, a pitiful, old, ugly,
illbred woman in a hatt, a midwife. Here were many of his, and as many
of her relations, sorry, mean people; and after choosing our gloves, we
all went over to the Three Crane Tavern,’ and though the best room in
the house, in such a narrow dogg-hole we were crammed, and I believe we
were near forty, that it made me loathe my company and victuals; and
a sorry poor dinner it was too. After dinner, I took aside the two
Joyce’s, and took occasion to thank them for their kind thoughts for a
wife for Tom: but that considering the possibility there is of my having
no child, and what then I shall be able to leave him, I do think he may
expect in that respect a wife with more money, and so desired them to
think no more of it. Now the jest was Anthony mistakes and thinks that I
did all this while encourage him (from my thoughts of favour to Tom) to
pursue the match till Will Joyce tells him that he was mistaken. But
how he takes it I know not, but I endeavoured to tell it him in the most
respectful way that I could. This done with my wife by coach to my aunt
Wight’s, where I left her, and I to the office, and that being done to
her again, and sat playing at cards after supper till 12 at night, and
so by moonshine home and to bed.
