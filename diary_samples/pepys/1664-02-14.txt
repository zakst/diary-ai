14th (Lord’s day). Up and to church alone, where a lazy sermon of Mr.
Mills, upon a text to introduce catechizing in his parish, which I
perceive he intends to begin. So home and very pleasant with my wife at
dinner. All the afternoon at my office alone doing business, and then
in the evening after a walk with my wife in the garden, she and I to my
uncle Wight’s to supper, where Mr. Norbury, but my uncle out of tune,
and after supper he seemed displeased mightily at my aunt’s desiring
[to] put off a copper kettle, which it seems with great study he had
provided to boil meat in, and now she is put in the head that it is not
wholesome, which vexed him, but we were very merry about it, and by and
by home, and after prayers to bed.
