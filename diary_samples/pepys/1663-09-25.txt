25th. Lay pretty long in bed, and so to my office all the morning till
by and by called out by Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten, with them by
water to Deptford, where it of a sudden did lighten, thunder, and rain
so as we could do nothing but stay in Davisâ€™s house, and by and by Sir
J. Minnes and I home again by water, and I home to dinner, and after
dinner to the office, and there till night all alone, even of my clerks
being there, doing of business, and so home and to bed.
