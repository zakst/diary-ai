11th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, myself and wife, where the
old dunce Meriton, brother to the known Meriton; of St. Martin’s,
Westminster, did make a very good sermon, beyond my expectation. Home
to dinner, and we carried in Pegg Pen, and there also come to us little
Michell and his wife, and dined very pleasantly. Anon to church, my wife
and I and Betty Michell, her husband being gone to Westminster.... Alter
church home, and I to my chamber, and there did finish the putting time
to my song of “It is decreed,” and do please myself at last and think
it will be thought a good song. By and by little Michell comes and takes
away his wife home, and my wife and brother and I to my uncle Wight’s,
where my aunt is grown so ugly and their entertainment so bad that I
am in pain to be there; nor will go thither again a good while, if sent
for, for we were sent for to-night, we had not gone else. Wooly’s wife,
a silly woman, and not very handsome, but no spirit in her at all; and
their discourse mean, and the fear of the troubles of the times hath
made them not to bring their plate to town, since it was carried out
upon the business of the fire, so that they drink in earth and a wooden
can, which I do not like. So home, and my people to bed. I late to
finish my song, and then to bed also, and the business of the firing of
the city, and the fears we have of new troubles and violences, and
the fear of fire among ourselves, did keep me awake a good while,
considering the sad condition I and my family should be in. So at last
to sleep.
