24th. To White Hall, and there all the morning, and they home, and
giving order for some business and setting my brother to making a
catalogue of my books, I back again to W. Hewer to White Hall, where
I attended the Duke of York and was by him led to [the King], who
expressed great sense of my misfortune in my eyes, and concernment for
their recovery; and accordingly signified, not only his assent to desire
therein, but commanded me to give them rest summer, according to my late
petition to the Duke of York. W. Hewer and I dined alone at the Swan;
and thence having thus waited on the King, spent till four o’clock in
St. James’s Park, when I met my wife at Unthanke’s, and so home.
