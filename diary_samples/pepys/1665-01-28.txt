28th. Up and to my office, where all the morning, and then home to
dinner, and after dinner abroad, walked to Paulâ€™s Churchyard, but my
books not bound, which vexed me. So home to my office again, where
very late about business, and so home to supper and to bed, my cold
continuing in a great degree upon me still. This day I received a good
sum of money due to me upon one score or another from Sir G. Carteret,
among others to clear all my matters about Colours,--[Flags]--wherein a
month or two since I was so embarrassed and I thank God I find myself to
have got clear, by that commodity, L50 and something more; and earned
it with dear pains and care and issuing of my owne money, and saved the
King near L100 in it.
