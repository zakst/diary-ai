13th. Up, and Greeting comes, and there he and I tried some things of
Mr. Lockeâ€™s for two flageolets, to my great content, and this day my
wife begins again to learn of him; for I have a great mind for her to
be able to play a part with me. Thence I to the Office, where all the
afternoon [morning??], and then to dinner, where W. Howe dined with me,
who tells me for certain that Creed is like to speed in his match with
Mrs. Betty Pickering. Here dined with me also Mr. Hollier, who is mighty
vain in his pretence to talk Latin. So to the Office again all the
afternoon till night, very busy, and so with much content home, and made
my wife sing and play on the flageolet to me till I slept with great
pleasure in bed.
