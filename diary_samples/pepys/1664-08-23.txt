23rd. Lay long talking with my wife, and angry awhile about her desiring
to have a French mayde all of a sudden, which I took to arise from
yesterday’s being with her mother. But that went over and friends again,
and so she be well qualitied, I care not much whether she be French or
no, so a Protestant. Thence to the office, and at noon to the ‘Change,
where very busy getting ships for Guinny and for Tangier. So home to
dinner, and then abroad all the afternoon doing several errands, to
comply with my oath of ending many businesses before Bartholomew’s day,
which is two days hence. Among others I went into New Bridewell, in my
way to Mr. Cole, and there I saw the new model, and it is very handsome.
Several at work, among others, one pretty whore brought in last night,
which works very lazily. I did give them 6d. to drink, and so away. To
Graye’s Inn, but missed Mr. Cole, and so homeward called at Harman’s,
and there bespoke some chairs for a room, and so home, and busy late,
and then to supper and to bed. The Dutch East India Fleete are now
come home safe, which we are sorry for. Our Fleets on both sides are
hastening out to Guinny.
