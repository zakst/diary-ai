30th. Fast-day for the King’s death. I all the morning at my chamber
making up my month’s accounts, which I did before dinner to my thorough
content, and find myself but a small gainer this month, having no manner
of profits, but just my salary, but, blessed be God! that I am able to
save out of that, living as I do. So to dinner, then to my chamber all
the afternoon, and in the evening my wife and I and Mercer and Barker
to little Michell’s, walked, with some neats’ tongues and cake and wine,
and there sat with the little couple with great pleasure, and talked and
eat and drank, and saw their little house, which is very pretty; and
I much pleased therewith, and so walked home, about eight at night, it
being a little moonshine and fair weather, and so into the garden, and,
with Mercer, sang till my wife put me in mind of its being a fast day;
and so I was sorry for it, and stopped, and home to cards awhile, and
had opportunity ‘para baiser’ Mercer several times, and so to bed.
