15th. Up by 4 o’clock, and after doing some business as to settling my
papers at home, I went to my office, and there busy till sitting time.
So at the office all the morning, where J. Southern, Mr. Coventry’s
clerk, did offer me a warrant for an officer to sign which I desired,
claiming it for my clerk’s duty, which however did trouble me a little
to be put upon it, but I did it. We broke up late, and I to dinner at
home, where my brother Tom and Mr. Cooke came and dined with me, but I
could not be merry for my business, but to my office again after dinner,
and they two and my wife abroad. In the evening comes Mr. Cooper, and I
took him by water on purpose to tell me things belonging to ships, which
was time well spent, and so home again, and my wife came home and tells
me she has been very merry and well pleased with her walk with them.
About bedtime it fell a-raining, and the house being all open at top, it
vexed me; but there was no help for it.
