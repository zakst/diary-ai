11th. Up betimes and to my office, where we sat also all the morning
till noon, and then home to dinner, my father being there but not very
well. After dinner in comes Captain Lambert of the Norwich, this day
come from Tangier, whom I am glad to see. There came also with him
Captain Wager, and afterwards in came Captain Allen to see me, of the
Resolution. All staid a pretty while, and so away, and I a while to my
office, then abroad into the street with my father, and left him to go
to see my aunt Wight and uncle, intending to lie at Tom’s to-night, or
my cozen Scott’s, where it seems he has hitherto lain and is most kindly
used there. So I home and to my office very late making up my Lord’s
navy accounts, wherein I find him to stand debtor L1200. So home to
supper and to bed.
