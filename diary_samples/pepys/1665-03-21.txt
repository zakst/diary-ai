21st. Up, and my taylor coming to me, did consult all my wardrobe how to
order my clothes against next summer. Then to the office, where busy all
the morning. At noon to the ‘Change, and brought home Mr. Andrews, and
there with Mr. Sheply dined and very merry, and a good dinner. Thence to
Mr. Povy’s to discourse about settling our business of Treasurer, and
I think all things will go very fayre between us and to my content, but
the more I see the more silly the man seems to me. Thence by coach to
the Mewes, but Creed was not there. In our way the coach drove through
a lane by Drury Lane, where abundance of loose women stood at the doors,
which, God forgive me, did put evil thoughts in me, but proceeded no
further, blessed be God. So home, and late at my office, then home and
there found a couple of state cups, very large, coming, I suppose, each
to about L6 a piece, from Burrows the slopseller.
