30th. After my singing-master had done with me this morning, I went to
White Hall and Westminster Hall, where I found the King expected to
come and adjourn the Parliament. I found the two Houses at a great
difference, about the Lords challenging their privileges not to have
their houses searched, which makes them deny to pass the House of
Commons’ Bill for searching for pamphlets and seditious books. Thence
by water to the Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his
barge to adjourn the House) where I dined with my Lady, and there met
Dr. Thomas Pepys, who I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very
good-natured. So home to the office, where we met about the business of
Tangier this afternoon. That done, at home I found Mr. Moore, and he and
I walked into the City and there parted. To Fleet Street to find when
the Assizes begin at Cambridge and Huntingdon, in order to my going to
meet with Roger Pepys for counsel. So in Fleet Street I met with Mr.
Salisbury, who is now grown in less than two years’ time so great a
limner--that he is become excellent, and gets a great deal of money at
it. I took him to Hercules Pillars to drink, and there came Mr. Whore
(whom I formerly have known), a friend of his to him, who is a very
ingenious fellow, and there I sat with them a good while, and so home
and wrote letters late to my Lord and to my father, and then to bed.
