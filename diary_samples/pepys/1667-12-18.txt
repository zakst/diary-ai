18th. Up, and to my goldsmith’s in the morning, to look after the
providing of L60 for Mr. Moore, towards the answering of my Lord
Sandwich’s bill of exchange, he being come to be contented with my
lending him L60 in part of it, which pleases me, I expecting to have
been forced to answer the whole bill; and this, which I do do, I hope
to secure out of the plate, which was delivered into my custody of my
Lord’s the other day by Mr. Cooke, and which I did get Mr. Stokes,
the goldsmith, last night to weigh at my house, and there is enough to
secure L100. Thence home to the office, and there all the morning by
particular appointment with Sir W. Pen, Sir R. Ford, and those that are
concerned for my Lady Batten (Mr. Wood, Young, and Lewes), to even the
accounts of our prize business, and at noon broke up, and to dinner,
every man to his own home, and to it till late at night again, and
we did come to some end, and I am mightily put to it how to order
the business of my bargaine, but my industry is to keep it off from
discourse till the ship be brought home safe, and this I did do, and so
we broke up, she appearing in our debts about L1500, and so we parted,
and I to my business, and home to my wife, who is troubled with the
tooth ake, and there however I got her to read to me the History of
Algiers, which I find a very pretty book, and so to supper with much
pleasure talking, and to bed. The Parliament not adjourned yet.
