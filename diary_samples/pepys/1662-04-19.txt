19th. Up betimes and to my office, and at 9 oâ€™clock, none of the rest
going, I went alone to Deptford, and there went on where they left last
night to pay Woolwich yard, and so at noon dined well, being chief
at the table, and do not see but every body begins to give me as much
respect and honour as any of the rest. After dinner to Pay again, and
so till 9 at night, my great trouble being that I was forced to begin
an ill practice of bringing down the wages of servants, for which people
did curse me, which I do not love. At night, after I had eaten a cold
pullet, I walked by brave moonshine, with three or four armed men
to guard me, to Redriffe, it being a joy to my heart to think of the
condition that I am now in, that people should of themselves provide
this for me, unspoke to. I hear this walk is dangerous to walk alone by
night, and much robbery committed here. So from thence by water home,
and so to my lodgings to bed.
