7th. Up, and this day begun, the first day this year, to put off my
linnen waistcoat, but it happening to be a cool day I was afraid of
taking cold, which troubles me, and is the greatest pain I have in the
world to think of my bad temper of my health. At the office all the
morning. Dined at home, to my office to prepare some things against a
Committee of Tangier this afternoon. So to White Hall, and there found
the Duke and twenty more reading their commission (of which I am, and
was also sent to, to come) for the Royall Fishery, which is very large,
and a very serious charter it is; but the company generally so ill
fitted for so serious a worke that I do much fear it will come to
little. That being done, and not being able to do any thing for lacke
of an oathe for the Governor and Assistants to take, we rose. Then our
Committee for the Tangier victualling met and did a little, and so up,
and I and Mr. Coventry walked in the garden half an hour, talking of
the business of our masts, and thence away and with Creed walked half an
hour or more in the Park, and thence to the New Exchange to drink some
creame, but missed it and so parted, and I home, calling by the way
for my new bookes, viz., Sir H. Spillman’s “Whole Glossary,” “Scapula’s
Lexicon,” and Shakespeare’s plays, which I have got money out of my
stationer’s bills to pay for. So home and to my office a while, and then
home and to bed, finding myself pretty well for all my waistecoate being
put off to-day. The king is pretty well to-day, though let blood the
night before yesterday.
