8th. All the morning at the office. At noon Sir W. Batten, Col. Slingsby
and I by coach to the Tower, to Sir John Robinson’s, to dinner; where
great good cheer. High company; among others the Duchess of Albemarle,
who is ever a plain homely dowdy. After dinner, to drink all the
afternoon. Towards night the Duchess and ladies went away. Then we set
to it again till it was very late. And at last came in Sir William Wale,
almost fuddled; and because I was set between him and another, only to
keep them from talking and spoiling the company (as we did to others),
he fell out with the Lieutenant of the Tower; but with much ado we made
him under stand his error, and then all quiet. And so he carried Sir
William Batten and I home again in his coach, and so I almost overcome
with drink went to bed. I was much contented to ride in such state into
the Tower, and be received among such high company, while Mr. Mount,
my Lady Duchess’s gentleman usher, stood waiting at table, whom I
ever thought a man so much above me in all respects; also to hear the
discourse of so many high Cavaliers of things past. It was a great
content and joy to me.
