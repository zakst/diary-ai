300 bills; whereas in the late Kingâ€™s time it was much to have 40. With
my money home by coach, it, being the first time that I could get home
before our gates were shut since I came to the Navy office. When I came
home I found my wife not very well of her old pain.... which she had
when we were married first. I went and cast up the expense that I laid
out upon my former house (because there are so many that are desirous of
it, and I am, in my mind, loth to let it go out of my hands, for fear of
a turn). I find my layings-out to come to about L20, which with my fine
will come to about L22 to him that shall hire my house of me.--[Pepys
wished to let his house in Axe Yard now that he had apartments at the
Navy Office.]--To bed.
