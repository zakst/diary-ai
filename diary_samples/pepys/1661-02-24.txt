24th (Lord’s day). Up early, and by appointment to St. Clement Danes
to church, and there to meet Captain Cocke, who had often commended Mr.
Alsopp, their minister, to me, who is indeed an able man, but as all
things else did not come up to my expectations. His text was that all
good and perfect gifts are from above. Thence Cocke and I to the Sun
tavern behind the Exchange, and there met with others that are come from
the same church, and staid and drank and talked with them a little, and
so broke up, and I to the Wardrobe and there dined, and staid all the
afternoon with my Lady alone talking, and thence to see Madame Turner,
who, poor lady, continues very ill, and I begin to be afraid of her.
Thence homewards, and meeting Mr. Yong, the upholster, he and I to the
Mitre, and with Mr. Rawlinson sat and drank a quart of sack, and so I to
Sir W. Batten’s and there staid and supped, and so home, where I found
an invitation sent my wife and I to my uncle Wight’s on Tuesday next to
the chine of beef which I presented them with yesterday. So to prayers
and to bed.
