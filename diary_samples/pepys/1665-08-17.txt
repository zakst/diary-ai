17th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
dined together upon some victuals I had prepared at Sir W. Batten’s upon
the King’s charge, and after dinner, I having dispatched some business
and set things in order at home, we down to the water and by boat to
Greenwich to the Bezan yacht, where Sir W. Batten, Sir J. Minnes, my
Lord Bruncker and myself, with some servants (among others Mr. Carcasse,
my Lord’s clerk, a very civil gentleman), embarked in the yacht and
down we went most pleasantly, and noble discourse I had with my Lord
Bruneker, who is a most excellent person. Short of Gravesend it grew
calme, and so we come to an anchor, and to supper mighty merry, and
after it, being moonshine, we out of the cabbin to laugh and talk, and
then, as we grew sleepy, went in and upon velvet cushions of the King’s
that belong to the yacht fell to sleep, which we all did pretty well
till 3 or 4 of the clock, having risen in the night to look for a new
comet which is said to have lately shone, but we could see no such
thing.
