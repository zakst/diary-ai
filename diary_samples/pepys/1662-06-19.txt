19th. Up by five o’clock, and while my man Will was getting himself
ready to come up to me I took and played upon my lute a little. So to
dress myself, and to my office to prepare things against we meet this
morning. We sat long to-day, and had a great private business before us
about contracting with Sir W. Rider, Mr. Cutler, and Captain Cocke,
for 500 ton of hemp, which we went through, and I am to draw up the
conditions. Home to dinner, where I found Mr. Moore, and he and I cast
up our accounts together and evened them, and then with the last chest
of crusados to Alderman Backwell’s, by the same token his lady going to
take coach stood in the shop, and having a gilded glassfull of perfumed
comfits given her by Don Duarte de Silva, the Portugall merchant, that
is come over with the Queen, I did offer at a taste, and so she poured
some out into my hand, and, though good, yet pleased me the better
coming from a pretty lady. So home and at the office preparing papers
and things, and indeed my head has not been so full of business a great
while, and with so much pleasure, for I begin to see the pleasure it
gives. God give me health. So to bed.
