2nd. At the office all the morning. At noon dined, and then to, the
‘Change, and there walked two hours or more with Sir W. Warren, who
after much discourse in general of Sir W. Batten’s dealings, he fell to
talk how every body must live by their places, and that he was willing,
if I desired it, that I should go shares with him in anything that he
deals in. He told me again and again, too, that he confesses himself
my debtor too for my service and friendship to him in his present great
contract of masts, and that between this and Christmas he shall be in
stocke and will pay it me. This I like well, but do not desire to become
a merchant, and, therefore, put it off, but desired time to think of
it. Thence to the King’s play-house, and there saw “Bartholomew Fayre,”
 which do still please me; and is, as it is acted, the best comedy in the
world, I believe. I chanced to sit by Tom Killigrew, who tells me
that he is setting up a Nursery; that is, is going to build a house in
Moorefields, wherein he will have common plays acted. But four operas it
shall have in the year, to act six weeks at a time; where we shall
have the best scenes and machines, the best musique, and every thing as
magnificent as is in Christendome; and to that end hath sent for voices
and painters and other persons from Italy. Thence homeward called upon
my Lord Marlborough, and so home and to my office, and then to Sir W.
Pen, and with him and our fellow officers and servants of the house and
none else to Church to lay his brother in the ground, wherein nothing
handsome at all, but that he lays him under the Communion table in the
chancel, about nine at night? So home and to bed.
