7th. Called up at three o’clock, and was a-horseback by four; and as
I was eating my breakfast I saw a man riding by that rode a little way
upon the road with me last night; and he being going with venison in his
pan-yards to London, I called him in and did give him his breakfast
with me, and so we went together all the way. At Hatfield we bayted and
walked into the great house through all the courts; and I would fain
have stolen a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which
troubled me. To horse again, and by degrees with much ado got to London,
where I found all well at home and at my father’s and my Lady’s, but
no news yet from my Lord where he is. At my Lady’s (whither I went with
Dean Fuller, who came to my house to see me just as I was come home)
I met with Mr. Moore, who told me at what a loss he was for me, for
to-morrow is a Seal day at the Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am
to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord Privy Seal, at the Seal. Home and to
bed.
