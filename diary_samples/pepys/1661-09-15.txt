15th (Lord’s day). To my aunt Kite’s in the morning to help my uncle
Fenner to put things in order against anon for the buriall, and at noon
home again; and after dinner to church, my wife and I, and after sermon
with my wife to the buriall of my aunt Kite, where besides us and my
uncle Fenner’s family, there was none of any quality, but poor rascally
people. So we went to church with the corps, and there had service read
at the grave, and back again with Pegg Kite who will be, I doubt, a
troublesome carrion to us executors; but if she will not be ruled, I
shall fling up my executorship. After that home, and Will Joyce along
with me where we sat and talked and drank and ate an hour or two, and so
he went away and I up to my chamber and then to prayers and to bed.
