28th. Up and to the office, where all the morning sitting, and at noon
upon several things to the ‘Change, and thence to Sir G. Carteret’s
to dinner of my own accord, and after dinner with Mr. Wayth down to
Deptford doing several businesses, and by land back again, it being
very cold, the boat meeting me after my staying a while for him at an
alehouse by Redriffe stairs. So home, and took Will coming out of my
doors, at which I was a little moved, and told my wife of her keeping
him from the office (though God knows my base jealous head was the cause
of it), which she seemed troubled at, and that it was only to discourse
with her about finding a place for her brother. So I to my office late,
Mr. Commander coming to read over my will in order to the engrossing
it, and so he being gone I to other business, among others chiefly upon
preparing matters against Creed for my profit, and so home to supper and
bed, being mightily troubled with my left eye all this evening from some
dirt that is got into it.
