11th. Lay long talking with my wife, then up and to my chamber preparing
papers against my father comes to lie here for discourse about country
business. Dined well with my wife at home, being myself not yet thorough
well, making water with some pain, but better than I was, and all my
fear of an ague gone away. In the afternoon my father came to see us,
and he gone I up to my morningâ€™s work again, and so in the evening a
little to the office and to see Sir W. Batten, who is ill again, and so
home to supper and to bed.
