16th. Th[ursday]. Greeting’s book, is. Begun this day to learn the
Recorder. To the office, where all the morning. Dined with my clerks:
and merry at Sir W. Pen’s crying yesterday, as they say, to the King,
that he was his martyr. So to White Hall by coach to Commissioners of
[the] Treasury about certificates, but they met not, 2s. To Westminster
by water. To Westminster Hall, where I hear W. Pen is ordered to be
impeached, 6d. There spoke with many, and particularly with G. Montagu:
and went with him and Creed to his house, where he told how W. Pen hath
been severe to Lord Sandwich; but the Coventrys both labouring to save
him, by laying it on Lord Sandwich, which our friends cry out upon, and
I am silent, but do believe they did it as the only way to save him. It
could not be carried to commit him. It is thought the House do coole: W.
Coventry’s being for him, provoked Sir R. Howard and his party;
Court, all for W. Pen. Thence to White Hall, but no meeting of the
Commissioners, and there met Mr. Hunt, and thence to Mrs. Martin’s, and,
there did what I would, she troubled for want of employ for her husband,
spent on her 1s. Thence to the Hall to walk awhile and ribbon, spent is.
So [to] Lord Crew’s, and there with G. Carteret and my Lord to talk, and
they look upon our matters much the better, and by this and that time
is got, 1s. So to the Temple late, and by water, by moonshine, home,
