19th. At the office all the morning, and coming home found Mr. Hunt with
my wife in the chamber alone, which God forgive me did trouble my head,
but remembering that it was washing and that there was no place else
with a fire for him to be in, it being also cold weather, I was at ease
again. He dined with us, and after dinner took coach and carried him
with us as far as my cozen Scottâ€™s, where we set him down and parted,
and my wife and I staid there at the christening of my cozens boy, where
my cozen Samuel Pepys, of Ireland, and I were godfathers, and I did
name the child Samuel. There was a company of pretty women there in the
chamber, but we staid not, but went with the minister into another room
and eat and drank, and at last, when most of the women were gone, Sam
and I went into my cozen Scott, who was got off her bed, and so we
staid and talked and were very merry, my she-cozen, Stradwick, being
godmother. And then I left my wife to go home by coach, and I walked to
the Temple about my law business, and there received a subpoena for T.
Trice. I carried it myself to him at the usual house at Doctors Commons
and did give it him, and so home and to bed. It cost me 20s, between the
midwife and the two nurses to-day.
