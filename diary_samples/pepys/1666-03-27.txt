27th. Up; and called up by the King’s trumpets, which cost me 10s. So
to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon, by invitation, my
wife, who had not been there these to months, I think, and I, to meet
all our families at Sir W. Batten’s at dinner, whither neither a great
dinner for so much company nor anything good or handsome. In the middle
of dinner I rose, and my wife, and by coach to the King’s playhouse,
and meeting Creed took him up, and there saw “The Scornfull Lady” well
acted; Doll Common doing Abigail most excellently, and Knipp the widow
very well, and will be an excellent actor, I think. In other parts the
play not so well done as used to be, by the old actors. Anon to White
Hall by coach, thinking to have seen a play there to-night, but found
it a mistake, so back again, and missed our coach[man], who was gone,
thinking to come time enough three hours hence, and we could not blame
him. So forced to get another coach, and all three home to my house, and
there to Sir W. Batten’s, and eat a bit of cold chine of beef, and
then staid and talked, and then home and sat and talked a little by the
fireside with my wife and Creed, and so to bed, my left eye being very
sore. No business publick or private minded all these two days. This
day a house or two was blown up with powder in the Minorys, and several
people spoiled, and many dug out from under the rubbish.
