15th. Up, and all the morning busy at the office to my great content,
attending to the settling of papers there that I may have the more rest
in winter for my eyes by how much I do the more in the settling of
all things in the summer by daylight. At noon home to dinner, where is
brought home the espinette I bought the other day of Haward; costs me
L5. So to St. James’s, where did our ordinary business with the Duke of
York. So to Unthanke’s to my wife, and with her and Deb. to visit Mrs.
Pierce, whom I do not now so much affect, since she paints. But stayed
here a while, and understood from her how my Lady Duchesse of Monmouth
is still lame, and likely always to be so, which is a sad chance for a
young [lady] to get, only by trying of tricks in dancing. So home, and
there Captain Deane come and spent the evening with me, to draw some
finishing lines on his fine draught of “The Resolution,” the best ship,
by all report, in the world, and so to bed. Wonderful hot all day and
night, and this the first night that I remember in my life that ever I
could lie with only a sheet and one rug. So much I am now stronger than
ever I remember myself, at least since before I had the stone.
