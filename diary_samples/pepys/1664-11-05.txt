5th. Up and to the office, where all the morning, at noon to the
‘Change, and thence home to dinner, and so with my wife to the Duke’s
house to a play, “Macbeth,” a pretty good play, but admirably acted.
Thence home; the coach being forced to go round by London Wall home,
because of the bonefires; the day being mightily observed in the City.
To my office late at business, and then home to supper, and to bed.
