7th. Up, and at the office very busy, and did much business all the
morning. My wife abroad with her maid Jane and Tom all the afternoon,
being gone forth to eat some pasties at “The Bottle of Hay,” in St.
John’s Street, as you go to Islington, of which she is mighty fond, and
I dined at home alone, and at the office close all the afternoon,
doing much business to my great content. This afternoon Mr. Pierce, the
surgeon, comes to me about business, and tells me that though the King
and my Lady Castlemayne are friends again, she is not at White Hall, but
at Sir D. Harvy’s, whither the King goes to her; and he says she made
him ask her forgiveness upon his knees, and promised to offend her no
more so: that, indeed, she did threaten to bring all his bastards to
his closet-door, and hath nearly hectored him out of his wits. I at my
office till night, and then home to my pipe, my wife not coming home,
which vexed me. I then into the garden, and there walked alone in the
garden till 10 at night, when she come home, having been upon the water
and could not get home sooner. So to supper, and to bed.
