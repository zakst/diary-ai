7th. This morning came one Mr. Hill (sent by Mr. Hunt, the Instrument
maker), to teach me to play on the Theorbo, but I do not like his play
nor singing, and so I found a way to put him off. So to the office. And
then to dinner, and got Mr. Pett the Commissioner to dinner with me, he
and I alone, my wife not being well, and so after dinner parted. And I
to Tom Trice, who in short shewed me a writt he had ready for my father,
and I promised to answer it. So I went to Dr. Williams (who is now
pretty well got up after his sickness), and after that to Mr. Moore to
advise, and so returned home late on foot, with my mind cleared, though
not satisfied. I met with letters at home from my Lord from Lisbone,
which speak of his being well; and he tells me he had seen at the court
there the day before he wrote this letter, the Juego de Toro.--[A bull
fight. See May 24th, 1662.--B:]--So fitted myself for bed. Coming home
I called at my uncle Fennerâ€™s, who tells that Peg Kite now hath declared
she will have the beggarly rogue the weaver, and so we are resolved
neither to meddle nor make with her.
