30th. At the office we and Sir W. Rider to advise what sort of
provisions to get ready for these ships going to the Indies. Then the
Comptroller and I by water to Mr. Coventry, and there discoursed upon
the same thing. So to my coz. Tho. Pepys, and got him to promise me
L1,000 to lend my Lord upon his and my uncle Robert’s and my security.
So to my Lord’s, and there got him to sign a bond to him, which I also
signed too, and he did sign counter security to us both. Then into
London up and down and drank a pint of wine with Mr. Creed, and so home
and sent a letter and the bonds to my uncle to sign for my Lord. This
day I spoke with Dr. Castle about making up the dividend for the last
quarter, and agreed to meet about it on Monday.
