5th. Lay long in bed, then up, called by Captain Cocke about business of
a contract of his for some Tarre, and so to the office, and then to
Sir W. Pen and there talked, and he being gone came Sir W. Warren and
discoursed about our business with Field, and at noon by agreement to
the Miter to dinner upon T. Trice’s 40s., to be spent upon our late
agreement. Here was a very poor dinner and great company. All our
lawyers on both sides, and several friends of his and some of mine
brought by him, viz., Mr. Moore, uncle Wight, Dr. Williams, and my cozen
Angier, that lives here in town, who t Captain John Shales after
dinner carried me aside and showed me a letter from his poor brother at
Cambridge to me of the same contents with that yesterday to me desiring
help from me. Here I was among a sorry company without any content or
pleasure, and at the last the reckoning coming to above 40s. by 15s., he
would have me pay the 10s. and he would pay the 5s., which was so poor
that I was ashamed of it, and did it only to save contending with
him. There, after agreeing a day for him and I to meet and seal our
agreement, I parted and home, and at the office by agreement came Mr.
Shales, and there he and I discourse till late the business of his
helping me in the discovery of some arrears of provisions and stores
due to the stores at Portsmouth, out of which I may chance to get some
money, and save the King some too, and therefore I shall endeavour to do
the fellow some right in other things here to his advantage between Mr.
Gauden and him. He gone my wife and I to her arithmetique, in which she
pleases me well, and so to the office, there set down my Journall, and
so home to supper and to bed. A little troubled to see how my family is
out of order by Will’s being there, and also to hear that Jane do not
please my wife as I expected and would have wished.
