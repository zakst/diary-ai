22nd. Up by three, and going by four on my way to London; but the day
proves very cold, so that having put on no stockings but thread ones
under my boots, I was fain at Bigglesworth to buy a pair of coarse
woollen ones, and put them on. So by degrees till I come to Hatfield
before twelve o’clock, where I had a very good dinner with my hostess,
at my Lord of Salisbury’s Inn, and after dinner though weary I walked
all alone to the Vineyard, which is now a very beautiful place again;
and coming back I met with Mr. Looker, my Lord’s gardener (a friend of
Mr. Eglin’s), who showed me the house, the chappell with brave pictures,
and, above all, the gardens, such as I never saw in all my life; nor so
good flowers, nor so great gooseberrys, as big as nutmegs. Back to the
inn, and drank with him, and so to horse again, and with much ado got to
London, and set him up at Smithfield; so called at my uncle Fenner’s,
my mother’s, my Lady’s, and so home, in all which I found all things as
well as I could expect. So weary and to bed.
