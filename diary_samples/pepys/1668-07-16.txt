16th. Up, and to the office, where Yeabsly and Lanyon come to town and
to speak with me about a matter wherein they are accused of cheating the
King before the Lords’ Commissioners of Tangier, and I doubt it true,
but I have no hand in it, but will serve them what I can. All the
morning at the office, and at noon dined at home, and then to the office
again, where we met to finish the draft of the Victualler’s contract,
and so I by water with my Lord Brouncker to Arundell House, to the
Royall Society, and there saw an experiment of a dog’s being tied
through the back, about the spinal artery, and thereby made void of all
motion; and the artery being loosened again, the dog recovers. Thence to
Cooper’s, and saw his advance on my wife’s picture, which will be indeed
very fine. So with her to the ‘Change, to buy some things, and here I
first bought of the sempstress next my bookseller’s, where the pretty
young girl is, that will be a great beauty. So home, and to supper with
my wife in the garden, it being these two days excessively hot, and so
to bed.
