14th. With Sir W. Batten and Pen to Mr. Coventry’s, and there had a
dispute about my claim to the place of Purveyor of Petty-provisions, and
at last to my content did conclude to have my hand to all the bills for
these provisions and Mr. Turner to purvey them, because I would not have
him to lose the place. Then to my Lord’s, and so with Mr. Creed to an
alehouse, where he told me a long story of his amours at Portsmouth to
one of Mrs. Boat’s daughters, which was very pleasant. Dined with my
Lord and Lady, and so with Mr. Creed to the Theatre, and there saw “King
and no King,” well acted. Thence with him to the Cock alehouse at Temple
Bar, where he did ask my advice about his amours, and I did give him it,
which was to enquire into the condition of his competitor, who is a
son of Mr. Gauden’s, and that I promised to do for him, and he to make
[what] use he can of it to his advantage. Home and to bed.
