2nd. This morning I wrote letters to Mr. Hill and Andrews to come to
dine with me to-morrow, and then I to the office, where busy, and thence
to dine with Sir J. Minnes, where merry, but only that Sir J. Minnes who
hath lately lost two coach horses, dead in the stable, has a third now a
dying. After dinner I to Deptford, and there took occasion to ‘entrar a
la casa de la gunaica de ma Minusier’, and did what I had a mind... To
Greenwich, where wrote some letters, and home in pretty good time.
