14th. Comes betimes a letter from Sir W. Coventry, that he and Sir G.
Carteret are ordered presently down to the Fleete. I up and saw Sir
W. Pen gone also after them, and so I finding it a leisure day fell to
making cleane my closett in my office, which I did to my content and set
up my Platts again, being much taken also with Griffin’s mayde, that
did cleane it, being a pretty mayde. I left her at it, and toward
Westminster myself with my wife by coach and meeting took up Mr. Lovett
the varnisher with us, who is a pleasant speaking and humoured man, so
my wife much taken with him, and a good deale of worke I believe I
shall procure him. I left my wife at the New Exchange and myself to
the Exchequer, to looke after my Tangier tallys, and there met Sir G.
Downing, who shewed me his present practise now begun this day to paste
up upon the Exchequer door a note of what orders upon the new Act are
paid and now in paying, and my Lord of Oxford coming by, also took him,
and shewed him his whole method of keeping his books, and everything of
it, which indeed is very pretty, and at this day there is assigned upon
the Act L804,000. Thence at the New Exchange took up my wife again, and
so home to dinner, and after dinner to my office again to set things in
order. In the evening out with my wife and my aunt Wight, to take the
ayre, and happened to have a pleasant race between our hackney-coach and
a gentleman’s. At Bow we eat and drank and so back again, it being very
cool in the evening. Having set home my aunt and come home, I fell to
examine my wife’s kitchen book, and find 20s. mistake, which made me
mighty angry and great difference between us, and so in the difference
to bed.
