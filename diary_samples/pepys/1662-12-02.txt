2nd. Before I went to the office my wife and I had another falling out
about Sarah, against whom she has a deadly hate, I know not for what,
nor can I see but she is a very good servant. Then to my office, and
there sat all the morning, and then to dinner with my wife at home, and
after dinner did give Jane a very serious lesson, against we take her
to be our chamber-maid, which I spoke so to her that the poor girl cried
and did promise to be very dutifull and carefull. So to the office,
where we sat as Commissioners for the Chest, and so examined most of the
old accountants to the Chest about it, and so we broke up, and I to my
office till late preparing business, and so home, being cold, and this
night first put on a wastecoate. So to bed.
