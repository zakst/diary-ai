10th. Sir W. Pen and I did a little business at the office, and so home
again. Then comes Dean Fuller after we had dined, but I got something
for him, and very merry we were for an hour or two, and I am most
pleased with his company and goodness. At last parted, and my wife and
I by coach to the Opera, and there saw the 2nd part of “The Siege of
Rhodes,” but it is not so well done as when Roxalana was there, who, it
is said, is now owned by my Lord of Oxford.

     [For note on Mrs. Davenport, who was deceived by a pretended
     marriage with the Earl of Oxford, see ante.  Lord Oxford’s first
     wife died in 1659.  He married, in 1672, his second wife, Diana
     Kirke, of whom nothing more need be said than that she bore an
     inappropriate Christian name.]

Thence to Tower-wharf, and there took boat, and we all walked to
Halfeway House, and there eat and drank, and were pleasant, and so
finally home again in the evening, end so good night, this being a very
pleasant life that we now lead, and have long done; the Lord be blessed,
and make us thankful. But, though I am much against too much spending,
yet I do think it best to enjoy some degree of pleasure now that we have
health, money, and opportunity, rather than to leave pleasures to old
age or poverty, when we cannot have them so properly.
