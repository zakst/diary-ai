19th. Up and to my office, where abundance of business all the morning.
Dined by my wife’s bedside, she not being yet well. We fell out almost
upon my discourse of delaying the having of Ashwell, where my wife
believing that I have a mind to have Pall, which I have not, though I
could wish she did deserve to be had. So to my office, where by and by
we sat, this afternoon being the first we have met upon a great while,
our times being changed because of the parliament sitting. Being rose, I
to my office till twelve at night, drawing out copies of the overcharge
of the Navy, one to send to Mr. Coventry early to-morrow. So home and to
bed, being weary, sleepy, and my eyes begin to fail me, looking so long
by candlelight upon white paper. This day I read the King’s speech to
the Parliament yesterday; which is very short, and not very obliging;
but only telling them his desire to have a power of indulging tender
consciences, not that he will yield to have any mixture in the
uniformity of the Church’s discipline; and says the same for the
Papists, but declares against their ever being admitted to have any
offices or places of trust in the kingdom; but, God knows, too many
have.
