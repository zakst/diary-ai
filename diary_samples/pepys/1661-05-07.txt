7th. In the morning to Mr. Coventry, Sir G. Carteret, and my Lord’s to
give them an account of my return. My Lady, I find, is, since my going,
gone to the Wardrobe. Then with Mr. Creed into London, to several places
about his and my business, being much stopped in our way by the City
traynebands, who go in much solemnity and pomp this day to muster before
the King and the Duke, and shops in the City are shut up every where
all this day. He carried me to an ordinary by the Old Exchange, where we
come a little too late, but we had very good cheer for our 18d. a-piece,
and an excellent droll too, my host, and his wife so fine a woman; and
sung and played so well that I staid a great while and drunk a great
deal of wine. Then home and staid among my workmen all day, and took
order for things for the finishing of their work, and so at night to
Sir W. Batten’s, and there supped and so home and to bed, having sent my
Lord a letter to-night to excuse myself for not going with him to-morrow
to the Hope, whither he is to go to see in what condition the fleet is
in.
