28th. Up and at the office sat all the morning, and at noon by Mr.
Coventry’s coach to the ‘Change, and after a little while there where I
met with Mr. Pierce, the chyrurgeon, who tells me for good newes that
my Lord Sandwich is resolved to go no more to Chelsy, and told me he
believed that I had been giving my Lord some counsel, which I neither
denied nor affirmed, but seemed glad with him that he went thither no
more, and so I home to dinner, and thence abroad to Paul’s Church Yard,
and there looked upon the second part of Hudibras, which I buy not, but
borrow to read, to see if it be as good as the first, which the world
cry so mightily up, though it hath not a good liking in me, though I had
tried by twice or three times reading to bring myself to think it witty.
Back again home and to my office, and there late doing business and
so home to supper and to bed. I have been told two or three times, but
to-day for certain I am told how in Holland publickly they have pictured
our King with reproach. One way is with his pockets turned the wrong
side outward, hanging out empty; another with two courtiers picking of
his pockets; and a third, leading of two ladies, while others abuse him;
which amounts to great contempt.
