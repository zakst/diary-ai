8th. Betimes by water to Sir W. Coventry, and there discoursed of
several things; and I find him much concerned in the present enquiries
now on foot of the Commissioners of Accounts, though he reckons himself
and the rest very safe, but vexed to see us liable to these troubles, in
things wherein we have laboured to do best. Thence, he being to go out
of town to-morrow, to drink Banbury waters, I to the Duke of York, to
attend him about business of the Office; and find him mighty free to
me, and how he is concerned to mend things in the Navy himself, and not
leave it to other people. So home to dinner; and then with my wife
to Cooper’s, and there saw her sit; and he do do extraordinary things
indeed. So to White Hall; and there by and by the Duke of York comes to
the Robe-chamber, and spent with us three hours till night, in hearing
the business of the Master-Attendants of Chatham, and the Store-keeper
of Woolwich; and resolves to displace them all; so hot he is of giving
proofs of his justice at this time, that it is their great fate now, to
come to be questioned at such a time as this. Thence I to Unthanke’s,
and took my wife and Deb. home, and to supper and to bed.
