14th. Up, and to my office, where sat all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, and thence all the afternoon hard at the office, we meeting
about the Victualler’s new contract; and so into the garden, my Lady
Pen, Mrs. Turner and her daughter, my wife and I, and there supped in
the dark and were merry, and so to bed. This day Bossc finished his copy
of my picture, which I confess I do not admire, though my wife prefers
him to Browne; nor do I think it like. He do it for W. Hewer, who hath
my wife’s also, which I like less. This afternoon my Lady Pickering come
to see us: I busy, saw her not. But how natural it is for us to slight
people out of power, and for people out of power to stoop to see those
that while in power they contemned!
