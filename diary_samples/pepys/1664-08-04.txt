4th. Up betimes and to the office, fitting myself against a great
dispute about the East India Company, which spent afterwards with us all
the morning. At noon dined with Sir W. Pen, a piece of beef only, and I
counterfeited a friendship and mirth which I cannot have with him, yet
out with him by his coach, and he did carry me to a play and pay for me
at the King’s house, which is “The Rivall Ladys,” a very innocent and
most pretty witty play. I was much pleased with it, and it being given
me, I look upon it as no breach to my oathe. Here we hear that Clun, one
of their best actors, was, the last night, going out of towne (after he
had acted the Alchymist, wherein was one of his best parts that he acts)
to his country-house, set upon and murdered; one of the rogues taken, an
Irish fellow. It seems most cruelly butchered and bound. The house will
have a great miss of him. Thence visited my Lady Sandwich, who tells me
my Lord FitzHarding is to be made a Marquis. Thence home to my office
late, and so to supper and to bed.
