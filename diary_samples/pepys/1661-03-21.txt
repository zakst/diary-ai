21st. Up very early, and to work and study in my chamber, and then
to Whitehall to my Lord, and there did stay with him a good while
discoursing upon his accounts. Here I staid with Mr. Creed all the
morning, and at noon dined with my Lord, who was very merry, and after
dinner we sang and fiddled a great while. Then I by water (Mr. Shepley,
Pinkney, and others going part of the way) home, and then hard at work
setting my papers in order, and writing letters till night, and so to
bed. This day I saw the Florence Ambassador go to his audience, the
weather very foul, and yet he and his company very gallant. After I was
a-bed Sir W. Pen sent to desire me to go with him to-morrow morning to
meet Sir W. Batten coming from Rochester.
