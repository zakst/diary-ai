12th. Up, still lying long in bed; then to the office, where sat very
long. Then home to dinner, and so to the office again, mighty busy, and
did to the joy of my soul dispatch much business, which do make my heart
light, and will enable me to recover all the ground I have lost (if I
have by my late minding my pleasures lost any) and assert myself. So
home to supper, and then to read a little in Moore’s “Antidote against
Atheisme,” a pretty book, and so to bed.
