21st. Up betimes and to my office, where busy all the morning, and
at noon, after a very little dinner, to it again, and by and by, by
appointment, our full board met, and Sir Philip Warwick and Sir Robert
Long came from my Lord Treasurer to speak with us about the state of
the debts of the Navy; and how to settle it, so as to begin upon the new
foundation of L200,000 per annum, which the King is now resolved not to
exceed. This discourse done, and things put in a way of doing, they went
away, and Captain Holmes being called in he began his high complaint
against his Master Cooper, and would have him forthwith discharged.
Which I opposed, not in his defence but for the justice of proceeding
not to condemn a man unheard, upon [which] we fell from one word to
another that we came to very high terms, such as troubled me, though
all and the worst that I ever said was that that was insolently or ill
mannerdly spoken. When he told me that it was well it was here that I
said it. But all the officers, Sir G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, Sir
W. Batten, and Sir W. Pen cried shame of it. At last he parted and we
resolved to bring the dispute between him and his Master to a trial next
week, wherein I shall not at all concern myself in defence of any thing
that is unhandsome on the Masterâ€™s part nor willingly suffer him to have
any wrong. So we rose and I to my office, troubled though sensible that
all the officers are of opinion that he has carried himself very much
unbecoming him. So wrote letters by the post, and home to supper and to
bed.
