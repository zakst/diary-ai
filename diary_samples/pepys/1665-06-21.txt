21st. Up, and very busy all the morning. At noon with Creed to the
Excise Office, where I find our tallys will not be money in less than
sixteen months, which is a sad thing for the King to pay all that
interest for every penny he spends; and, which is strange, the
goldsmiths with whom I spoke, do declare that they will not be moved
to part with money upon the increase of their consideration of ten per
cent. which they have, and therefore desire I would not move in it, and
indeed the consequence would be very ill to the King, and have its ill
consequences follow us through all the King’s revenue. Home, and my
uncle Wight and aunt James dined with me, my mother being to go
away to-morrow. So to White Hall, and there before and after Council
discoursed with Sir Thomas Ingram about our ill case as to Tangier for
money. He hath got the King to appoint a meeting on Friday, which I hope
will put an end one way or other to my pain. So homewards and to the
Cross Keys at Cripplegate, where I find all the towne almost going out
of towne, the coaches and waggons being all full of people going into
the country. Here I had some of the company of the tapster’s wife a
while, and so home to my office, and then home to supper and to bed.
