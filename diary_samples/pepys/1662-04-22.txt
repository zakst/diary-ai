22nd. Up betimes among my workmen, hastening to get things ready against
my wife’s coming, and so with Sir J. M., Sir W. B., and Sir W. P., by
coach to St. James’s, and there with the Duke. I did give him an account
of all things past of late; but I stood in great pain, having a great
fit of the colic, having catched cold yesterday by putting off my
stockings to wipe my toes, but at last it lessened, and then I was
pretty well again, but in pain all day more or less. Thence I parted
from them and walked to Greatorex’s, and there with him did overlook
many pretty things, new inventions, and have bespoke a weather glass of
him. Thence to my Lord Crew’s, and dined with the servants, he having
dined; and so, after dinner, up to him, and sat an hour talking with him
of publique, and my Lord’s private businesses, with much content. So to
my brother Tom’s, where Mr. Cooke expected me, and did go with me to see
Mr. Young and Mr. Lull in Blackfryers, kindred of Tom’s mistress, where
I was very well used, and do find things to go in the business to my
good content. Thence to Mr. Townsend, and did there talk with Mr. Young
himself also, and then home and to my study, and so to my lodgings and
to bed.
