25th. This morning came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle’s
papers, which will now set me at work enough. At noon I went to the
Exchange, where I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented
about my father (whether that he takes it ill that he has not been
acquainted with things, or whether he takes it ill that he has nothing
left him, I cannot tell), for which I am much troubled, and so staid not
long to talk with him. Thence to my mother’s, where I found my wife
and my aunt Bell and Mrs. Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was
between the old women and my mother, who thinks that there is, God knows
what fallen to her, which makes me mad, but it was not a proper time to
speak to her of it, and so I went away with Mr. Moore, and he and I to
the Theatre, and saw “The Jovial Crew,” the first time I saw it, and
indeed it is as merry and the most innocent play that ever I saw, and
well performed. From thence home, and wrote to my father and so to bed.
Full of thoughts to think of the trouble that we shall go through before
we come to see what will remain to us of all our expectations.
