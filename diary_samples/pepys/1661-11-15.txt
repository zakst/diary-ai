15th. At home all the morning, and at noon with my wife to the Wardrobe
to dinner, and there, did shew herself to my Lady in the handkercher
that she bought the lace for the other day, and indeed it is very
handsome. Here I left my wife and went to my Lord Privy Seal to
Whitehall, and there did give him a copy of the Fees of the office as
I have received them, and he was well pleased with it. So to the Opera,
where I met my wife and Captain Ferrers and Madamoiselle Le Blanc, and
there did see the second part of “The Siege of Rhodes” very well done;
and so by coach set her home, and the coach driving down the hill
through Thames Street, which I think never any coach did before from
that place to the bridge-foot, but going up Fish Street Hill his horses
were so tired, that they could not be got to go up the hill, though all
the street boys and men did beat and whip them. At last I was fain to
send my boy for a link, and so light out of the coach till we got to
another at the corner of Fenchurch Street, and so home, and to bed.
