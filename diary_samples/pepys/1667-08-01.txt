August 1st. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon my wife and
I dined at Sir W. Pen’s, only with Mrs. Turner and her husband, on a
damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil. However, I did not know
it till dinner was done. We had nothing but only this, and a leg of
mutton, and a pullet or two. Mrs. Markham was here, with her great
belly. I was very merry, and after dinner, upon a motion of the women,
I was got to go to the play with them-the first I have seen since before
the Dutch coming upon our coast, and so to the King’s house, to see “The
Custome of the Country.” The house mighty empty--more than ever I saw
it--and an ill play. After the play, we into the house, and spoke with
Knipp, who went abroad with us by coach to the Neat Houses in the way to
Chelsy; and there, in a box in a tree, we sat and sang, and talked and
eat; my wife out of humour, as she always is, when this woman is by.
So, after it was dark, we home. Set Knepp down at home, who told us the
story how Nell is gone from the King’s house, and is kept by my Lord
Buckhurst. Then we home, the gates of the City shut, it being so late:
and at Newgate we find them in trouble, some thieves having this night
broke open prison. So we through, and home; and our coachman was fain to
drive hard from two or three fellows, which he said were rogues, that
he met at the end of Blow-bladder Street, next Cheapside. So set Mrs.
Turner home, and then we home, and I to the Office a little; and so home
and to bed, my wife in an ill humour still.
