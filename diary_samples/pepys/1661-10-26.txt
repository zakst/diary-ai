26th. This morning Sir W. Pen and I should have gone out of town with
my Lady Batten, to have met Sir William coming back from Portsmouth; at
Kingston, but could not, by reason that my Lord of Peterborough (who is
to go Governor of Tangier) came this morning, with Sir G. Carteret, to
advise with us about completing of the affairs and preparacions for that
place. So at the office all the morning, and in the afternoon Sir W.
Pen, my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw “The Country Captain,”
 the first time it hath been acted this twenty-five years, a play of my
Lord Newcastle’s, but so silly a play as in all my life I never saw, and
the first that ever I was weary of in my life. So home again, and in the
evening news was brought that Sir R. Slingsby, our Comptroller (who
hath this day been sick a week), is dead; which put me into so great a
trouble of mind, that all the night I could not sleep, he being a man
that loved me, and had many qualitys that made me to love him above all
the officers and commissioners in the Navy. Coming home we called at Dan
Rawlinson’s; and there drank good sack, and so home.
