29th. Up and with my father towards my house, and by the way met with
Lieut. Lambert, and with him to the Dolphin in Tower Street and drank
our morning draught, he being much troubled about his being offered
a fourth rate ship to be Lieutenant of her now he has been two years
Lieutenant in a first rate. So to the office, where it is determined
that I should go to-morrow to Portsmouth. So I went out of the office
to Whitehall presently, and there spoke with Sir W. Pen and Sir George
Carteret and had their advice as to my going, and so back again home,
where I directed Mr. Hater what to do in order to our going to-morrow,
and so back again by coach to Whitehall and there eat something in the
buttery at my Lord’s with John Goods and Ned Osgood. And so home again,
and gave order to my workmen what to do in my absence. At night to Sir
W. Batten’s, and by his and Sir W. Pen’s persuasion I sent for my wife
from my father’s, who came to us to Mrs. Turner’s, where we were all
at a collacion to-night till twelve o’clock, there being a gentlewoman
there that did play well and sang well to the Harpsicon, and very merry
we were. So home and to bed, where my wife had not lain a great while.
