25th. Received a writ from the Exchequer this morning of distrain for
L70,000, which troubled me, though it be but, matter of form. To the
office, where sat all the morning. At noon my wife being to Unthanke’s
christening, I to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where merry, and the rather
because we are like to come to some good end in another of our prizes.
Thence by coach to my Lord Treasurer’s, and there being come too soon
to the New Exchange, but did nothing, and back again, and there found
my Lord Bruncker and T. Harvy, and walked in a room very merrily
discoursing. By and by comes my Lord Ashly and tells us my Lord
Treasurer is ill and cannot speak with us now. Thence away, Sir W. Pen
and I and Mr. Lewes, who come hither after us, and Mr. Gawden in the
last man’s coach. Set me down by the Poultry, and I to Sir Robert
Viner’s, and there had my account stated and took it home to review. So
home to the office, and there late writing out something, having been
a little at Sir W. Batten’s to talk, and there vexed to see them give
order for Hogg’s further abroad, and so home and to bed.
