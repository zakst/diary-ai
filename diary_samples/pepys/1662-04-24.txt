24th. Up betimes and among my workmen, and among them all the morning
till noon, and then to my Lord Crew’s, and there dined alone with him,
and among other things he do advise me by all means to keep my Lord
Sandwich from proceeding too far in the business of Tangier. First, for
that he is confident the King will not be able to find money for the
building the Mole; and next, for that it is to be done as we propose it
by the reducing of the garrison; and then either my Lord must oppose
the Duke of York, who will have the Irish regiment under the command of
Fitzgerald continued, or else my Lord Peterborough, who is concerned to
have the English continued, and he, it seems, is gone back again
merely upon my Lord Sandwich’s encouragement. Thence to Mr. Wotton, the
shoemaker’s, and there bought a pair of boots, cost me 30s., and he
told me how Bird hath lately broke his leg, while he was fencing in
“Aglaura,” upon the stage, and that the new theatre of all will be ready
against term. So to my brother’s, and there discoursed with him and Mr.
Cooke about their journey to Tom’s mistress again, and I did speak with
Mr. Croxton about measuring of silk flags. So by water home and to my
workmen, and so at night till late at my office, inditing a letter from
Tom to his mistress upon his sending her a watch for a token, and so
home and to supper, and to my lodgings and to bed. It is my content that
by several hands to-day I hear that I have the name of good-natured man
among the poor people that come to the office.
