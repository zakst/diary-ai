9th (Lordâ€™s day). To church with my wife in the morning, in her new
light-coloured silk gowne, which is, with her new point, very noble.
Dined at home, and in the afternoon to Fanchurch, the little church in
the middle of Fanchurch Streete, where a very few people and few of
any rank. Thence, after sermon, home, and in the evening walking in the
garden, my Lady Pen and her daughter walked with my wife and I, and so
to my house to eat with us, and very merry, and so broke up and to bed.
