10th. Up very betimes and to my office, where most hard at business
alone all the morning. At noon to the Exchange, where I hear that after
great expectation from Ireland, and long stop of letters, there is good
news come, that all is quiett after our great noise of troubles there,
though some stir hath been as was reported. Off the Exchange with Sir J.
Cutler and Mr. Grant to the Royall Oak Tavern, in Lumbard Street, where
Alexander Broome the poet was, a merry and witty man, I believe, if he
be not a little conceited, and here drank a sort of French wine, called
Ho Bryan,

     [Haut Brion, a claret; one of the first growths of the red wines of
     Medoc.]

that hath a good and most particular taste that I never met with. Home
to dinner, and then by water abroad to Whitehall, my wife to see Mrs.
Ferrers, I to Whitehall and the Park, doing no business. Then to my
Lordâ€™s lodgings, met my wife, and walked to the New Exchange. There laid
out 10s. upon pendents and painted leather gloves, very pretty and all
the mode. So by coach home and to my office till late, and so to supper
and to bed.
