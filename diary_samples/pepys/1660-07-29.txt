29th. Lord’s day. I and my boy Will to Whitehall, and I with my Lord
to White Hall Chappell, where I heard a cold sermon of the Bishop of
Salisbury’s, and the ceremonies did not please me, they do so overdo
them. My Lord went to dinner at Kensington with my Lord Camden. So I
dined and took Mr. Birfett, my Lord’s chaplain, and his friend along
with me, with Mr. Sheply at my Lord’s. In the afternoon with Dick Vines
and his brother Payton, we walked to Lisson Green and Marybone and back
again, and finding my Lord at home I got him to look over my accounts,
which he did approve of and signed them, and so we are even to this day.
Of this I was glad, and do think myself worth clear money about L120.
Home late, calling in at my father’s without stay. To bed.
