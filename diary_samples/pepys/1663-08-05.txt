5th. All the morning at the office, whither Deane of Woolwich came to
me and discoursed of the body of ships, which I am now going about to
understand, and then I took him to the coffee-house, where he was very
earnest against Mr. Grant’s report in favour of Sir W. Petty’s vessel,
even to some passion on both sides almost. So to the Exchange,
and thence home to dinner with my brother, and in the afternoon to
Westminster hall, and there found Mrs. Lane, and by and by by agreement
we met at the Parliament stairs (in my way down to the boat who should
meet us but my lady Jemimah, who saw me lead her but said nothing to
me of her, though I ought to speak to her to see whether she would take
notice of it or no) and off to Stangate and so to the King’s Head at
Lambeth marsh, and had variety of meats and drinks, but I did so towse
her and handled her, but could get nothing more from her though I
was very near it; but as wanton and bucksome as she is she dares not
adventure upon the business, in which I very much commend and like her.
Staid pretty late, and so over with her by water, and being in a great
sweat with my towsing of her durst not go home by water, but took coach,
and at home my brother and I fell upon Des Cartes, and I perceive he has
studied him well, and I cannot find but he has minded his book, and do
love it. This evening came a letter about business from Mr. Coventry,
and with it a silver pen he promised me to carry inke in, which is very
necessary. So to prayers and to bed.
