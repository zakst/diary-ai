17th (Lord’s day). To our own church, and at noon, by invitation, Sir W.
Pen dined with me, and I took Mrs. Hester, my Lady Batten’s kinswoman,
to dinner from church with me, and we were very merry. So to church
again, and heard a simple fellow upon the praise of Church musique,
and exclaiming against men’s wearing their hats on in the church, but
I slept part of the sermon, till latter prayer and blessing and all was
done without waking which I never did in my life. So home, and by and
by comes my uncle Wight and my aunt and Mr. Norbury and his lady, and we
drank hard and were very merry till supper time, and then we parted, my
wife and I being invited to Sir W. Pen’s, where we also were very merry,
and so home to prayers and to bed.
