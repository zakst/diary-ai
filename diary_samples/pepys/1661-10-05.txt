5th. At the office all the morning, then dined at home, and so staid at
home all the afternoon putting up my Lord’s model of the Royal James,
which I borrowed of him long ago to hang up in my room. And at night Sir
W. Pen and I alone to the Dolphin, and there eat some bloat-herrings

     [To bloat is to dry by smoke, a method chiefly used to cure herrings
     or bloaters.  “I have more smoke in my mouth than would blote a
     hundred herrings.”--Beaumont and Fletcher, Island Princess.  “Why,
     you stink like so many bloat-herrings newly taken out of the
     chimney.”--Ben Jonson, “Masque of Augurs.”]

and drank good sack. Then came in Sir W. Warren and another and staid a
while with us, and then Sir Arnold Brames, with whom we staid late and
till we had drank too much wine. So home and I to bed pleased at my
afternoon’s work in hanging up the shipp. So to bed.
