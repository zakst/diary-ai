January 1st. Waking this morning out of my sleep on a sudden, I did with
my elbow hit my wife a great blow over her face and nose, which waked
her with pain, at which I was sorry, and to sleep again. Up and went
forth with Sir W. Pen by coach towards Westminster, and in my way seeing
that the “Spanish Curate” was acted today, I light and let him go alone,
and I home again and sent to young Mr. Pen and his sister to go anon
with my wife and I to the Theatre. That done, Mr. W. Pen came to me
and he and I walked out, and to the Stacioner’s, and looked over some
pictures and traps for my house, and so home again to dinner, and by and
by came the two young Pens, and after we had eat a barrel of oysters we
went by coach to the play, and there saw it well acted, and a good play
it is, only Diego the Sexton did overdo his part too much. From thence
home, and they sat with us till late at night at cards very merry, but
the jest was Mr. W. Pen had left his sword in the coach, and so my boy
and he run out after the coach, and by very great chance did at the
Exchange meet with the coach and got his sword again. So to bed.
