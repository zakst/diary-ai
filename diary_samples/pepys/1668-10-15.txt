15th. Up, and all the morning at the office, and at home at dinner,
where, after dinner, my wife and I and Deb. out by coach to the
upholsters in Long Lane, Alderman Reeve’s, and then to Alderman Crow’s,
to see variety of hangings, and were mightily pleased therewith, and
spent the whole afternoon thereupon; and at last I think we shall pitch
upon the best suit of Apostles, where three pieces for my room will come
to almost L80: so home, and to my office, and then home to supper and to
bed. This day at the Board comes unexpected the warrants from the Duke
of York for Mr. Turner and Hater, for the places they desire, which
contents me mightily.
