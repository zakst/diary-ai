16th (Lordâ€™s day). My wife and I at church, our pew filled with Mrs.
Backewell, and six more that she brought with her, which vexed me at
her confidence. Dined at home and W. Batelier with us, and I all the
afternoon drawing up a foul draught of my petition to the Duke of
York, about my eyes, for leave to spend three or four months out of the
Office, drawing it so as to give occasion to a voyage abroad which I
did, to my pretty good liking; and then with my wife to Hyde Park, where
a good deal of company, and good weather, and so home to supper and to
bed.
