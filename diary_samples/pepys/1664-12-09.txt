9th. Up betimes and walked to Mr. Povy’s, and there, not without some
few troublesome questions of his, I got a note, and went and received
L117 5s. of Alderman Viner upon my pretended freight of the “William”
 for Tangier, which overbears me on one side with joy and on the other
to think of my condition if I shall be called into examination about it,
and (though in strictness it is due) not be able to give a good account
of it. Home with it, and there comes Captain Taylor to me, and he and
I did set even the business of the ship Union lately gone for Tangier,
wherein I hope to get L50 more, for all which the Lord be praised. At
noon home to dinner, Mr. Hunt and his wife with us, and very pleasant.
Then in the afternoon I carried them home by coach, and I to Westminster
Hall, and thence to Gervas’s, and there find I cannot prevail with Jane
to go forth with me, but though I took a good occasion of going to the
Trumpet she declined coming, which vexed me. ‘Je avait grande envie
envers elle, avec vrai amour et passion’. Thence home and to my office
till one in the morning, setting to rights in writing this day’s two
accounts of Povy and Taylor, and then quietly to bed. This day I had
several letters from several places, of our bringing in great numbers of
Dutch ships.
