7th (Lord’s day). All the morning at home making up my accounts (God
forgive me!) to give up to my Lord this afternoon. Then about 11 o’clock
out of doors towards Westminster and put in at Paul’s, where I saw our
minister, Mr. Mills, preaching before my Lord Mayor. So to White Hall,
and there I met with Dr. Fuller of Twickenham, newly come from Ireland;
and took him to my Lord’s, where he and I dined; and he did give my Lord
and me a good account of the condition of Ireland, and how it come to
pass, through the joyning of the Fanatiques and the Presbyterians, that
the latter and the former are in their declaration put together under
the names of Fanatiques. After dinner, my Lord and I and Mr. Shepley did
look over our accounts and settle matters of money between us; and my
Lord did tell me much of his mind about getting money and other things
of his family, &c. Then to my father’s, where I found Mr. Hunt and his
wife at supper with my father and mother and my wife, where after supper
I left them and so home, and then I went to Sir W. Batten’s and resolved
of a journey tomorrow to Chatham, and so home and to bed.
