2nd. To Savill the painter’s, but he not being well I could do nothing
there, and so I returned home, and in my way met Mr. Moore and took him
with me home; where we staid and talked all the morning, and he dined
with me, and after dinner went away to the Privy Seal, this being
our first day this month. By and by called on by Mr. Sanchy and his
mistress, and with them by coach to the Opera, to see “The Mad Lover,”
 but not much pleased with the play. That done home all to my house,
where they staid and supped and were merry, and at last late bid good
night and so we to bed.
