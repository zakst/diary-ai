29th (Lord’s day). This morning I put on my best black cloth suit,
trimmed with scarlett ribbon, very neat, with my cloake lined with
velvett, and a new beaver, which altogether is very noble, with my black
silk knit canons I bought a month ago. I to church alone, my wife not
going, and there I found my Lady Batten in a velvet gown, which vexed
me that she should be in it before my wife, or that I am able to put
her into one, but what cannot be, cannot be. However, when I came home I
told my wife of it, and to see my weaknesse, I could on the sudden have
found my heart to have offered her one, but second thoughts put it by,
and indeed it would undo me to think of doing as Sir W. Batten and his
Lady do, who has a good estate besides his office. A good dinner we had
of boeuf a la mode, but not roasted so well as my wife used to do it. So
after dinner I to the French Church, but that being too far begun I came
back to St. Dunstan’s by six and heard a good sermon, and so home and
to my office all, the evening making up my accounts of this month, and
blessed be God I have got up my crumb again to L770, the most that ever
I had yet, and good clothes a great many besides, which is a great mercy
of God to me. So home to supper and to bed.
