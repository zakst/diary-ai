29th. Busy all the morning at the office. So home to dinner, where
Mercer, and there comes Mr. Swan, my old acquaintance, and dines
with me, and tells me, for a certainty, that Creed is to marry Betty
Pickering, and that the thing is concluded, which I wonder at, and am
vexed for. So he gone I with my wife and two girls to the King’s house,
and saw “The Mad Couple,” a mean play altogether, and thence to Hyde
Parke, where but few coaches, and so to the New Exchange, and thence by
water home, with much pleasure, and then to sing in the garden, and so
home to bed, my eyes for these four days being my trouble, and my heart
thereby mighty sad.
