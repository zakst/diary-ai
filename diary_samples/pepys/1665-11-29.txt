29th. Up, my wife and I talking how to dispose of our goods, and
resolved upon sending our two mayds Alce (who has been a day or two at
Woolwich with my wife, thinking to have had a feast there) and Susan
home. So my wife after dinner did take them to London with some goods,
and I in the afternoon after doing other business did go also by
agreement to meet Captain Cocke and from him to Sir Roger Cuttance,
about the money due from Cocke to him for the late prize goods, wherein
Sir Roger is troubled that he hath not payment as agreed, and the other,
that he must pay without being secured in the quiett possession of them,
but some accommodation to both, I think, will be found. But Cocke do
tell me that several have begged so much of the King to be discovered
out of stolen prize goods and so I am afeard we shall hereafter have
trouble, therefore I will get myself free of them as soon as I can and
my money paid. Thence home to my house, calling my wife, where the poor
wretch is putting things in a way to be ready for our coming home, and
so by water together to Greenwich, and so spent the night together.
