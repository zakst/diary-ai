4th. Lord’s day; and my wife and I the first time together at church
since the plague, and now only because of Mr. Mills his coming home to
preach his first sermon; expecting a great excuse for his leaving the
parish before any body went, and now staying till all are come home;
but he made but a very poor and short excuse, and a bad sermon. It was
a frost, and had snowed last night, which covered the graves in the
churchyard, so as I was the less afeard for going through. Here I had
the content to see my noble Mrs. Lethulier, and so home to dinner, and
all the afternoon at my Journall till supper, it being a long while
behindhand. At supper my wife tells me that W. Joyce has been with her
this evening, the first time since the plague, and tells her my aunt
James is lately dead of the stone, and what she had hath given to his
and his brother’s wife and my cozen Sarah. So after supper to work
again, and late to bed.
