11th. Up, and at my Office all the morning, and after dinner all the
afternoon in my house with Batelier shut up, drawing up my defence to
the Duke of York upon his great letter, which I have industriously taken
this opportunity of doing for my future use. At it late, and my mind and
head mighty full of it all night.
