29th. Up, and it being my Lord Mayor’s show, my boy and three mayds went
out; but it being a very foule, rainy day, from morning till night, I
was sorry my wife let them go out. All the morning at the office.
At dinner at home. In the afternoon to the office again, and about 9
o’clock by appointment to the King’s Head tavern upon Fish Street Hill,
whither Mr. Wolfe (and Parham by his means) met me to discourse about
the Fishery, and great light I had by Parham, who is a little conceited,
but a very knowing man in his way, and in the general fishing trade of
England. Here I staid three hours, and eat a barrel of very fine oysters
of Wolfe’s giving me, and so, it raining hard, home and to my office,
and then home to bed. All the talke is that De Ruyter is come over-land
home with six or eight of his captaines to command here at home, and
their ships kept abroad in the Straights; which sounds as if they had a
mind to do something with us.
