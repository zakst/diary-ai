24th. Up betimes and Sir D. Gawden with me, and I told him all, being
very desirous for the Kingâ€™s sake, as well as my own, that he may be
kept in it, and after consulting him I to the Office, where we met again
and spent most of the morning about this business, and no other, and
so at noon home to dinner, and then close with Mr. Gibson till night,
drawing up our answer, which I did the most part by seven at night, and
so to Lord Brouncker and the rest at his lodgings to read it, and they
approved of it. So back home to supper, and made my boy read to me
awhile, and then to bed.
