31st. Up, and at my office all the morning. About noon with Mr.
Ashburnham to the new Excise Office, and there discoursed about
our business, and I made him admire my drawing a thing presently in
shorthand: but, God knows! I have paid dear for it, in my eyes. Home and
to dinner, and then my wife and Deb. and I, with Sir J. Minnes, to White
Hall, she going hence to the New Exchange, and the Duke of York not
being in the way, Sir J. Minnes and I to her and took them two to the
King’s house, to see the first day of Lacy’s “Monsieur Ragou,” now new
acted. The King and Court all there, and mighty merry--a farce. Thence
Sir J. Minnes giving us, like a gentleman, his coach, hearing we had
some business, we to the Park, and so home. Little pleasure there, there
being little company, but mightily taken with a little chariot that we
saw in the street, and which we are resolved to have ours like it. So
home to walk in the garden a little, and then to bed. The month ends
mighty sadly with me, my eyes being now past all use almost; and I am
mighty hot upon trying the late printed experiment of paper tubes.
