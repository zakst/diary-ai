28th (Lordâ€™s day). This morning as my wife and I were going to church,
comes Mrs. Ramsay to see us, so we sent her to church, and we went too,
and came back to dinner, and she dined with us and was wellcome. To
church again in the afternoon, and then come home with us Sir W. Pen,
and drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his
daughter that is lately come out of Ireland. I staid at home at my book;
she came back again and tells me that whereas I expected she should
have been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl. This evening my wife
gives me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in
my own custody. To supper and to bed.
