6th (Twelfth day). This morning I sent my lute to the Paynter’s, and
there I staid with him all the morning to see him paint the neck of
my lute in my picture, which I was not pleased with after it was done.
Thence to dinner to Sir W. Pen’s, it being a solemn feast day with him,
his wedding day, and we had, besides a good chine of beef and other good
cheer, eighteen mince pies in a dish, the number of the years that he
hath been married, where Sir W. Batten and his Lady, and daughter was,
and Colonel Treswell and Major Holmes, who I perceive would fain get
to be free and friends with my wife, but I shall prevent it, and she
herself hath also a defyance against him. After dinner they set in
to drinking, so that I would stay no longer, but went away home, and
Captain Cock, who was quite drunk, comes after me, and there sat awhile
and so away, and anon I went again after the company was gone, and
sat and played at cards with Sir W. Pen and his children, and so after
supper home, and there I hear that my man Gull was gone to bed, and upon
enquiry I hear that he did vomit before he went to bed, and complained
his head ached, and thereupon though he was asleep I sent for him out
of his bed, and he rose and came up to me, and I appeared very angry and
did tax him with being drunk, and he told me that he had been with Mr.
Southerne and Homewood at the Dolphin, and drank a quart of sack, but
that his head did ache before he went out. But I do believe he has drunk
too much, and so I did threaten him to bid his uncle dispose of him some
other way, and sent him down to bed and do resolve to continue to be
angry with him. So to bed to my wife, and told her what had passed.
