4th (Lord’s day). Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my
cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit, and then discoursed at large
about the business I came for, that is, about my uncle’s will, in which
he did give me good satisfaction, but tells me I shall meet with a great
deal of trouble in it. However, in all things he told me what I am to
expect and what to do. To church, and had a good plain sermon, and my
uncle Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all
rose with so much reverence; and when the parson begins, he begins
“Right worshipfull and dearly beloved” to us. Home to dinner, which was
very good, and then to church again, and so home and to walk up and
down and so to supper, and after supper to talk about publique matters,
wherein Roger Pepys--(who I find a very sober man, and one whom I do now
honour more than ever before for this discourse sake only) told me how
basely things have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did
labour to oppose all things that were moved by serious men. That they
are the most prophane swearing fellows that ever he heard in his life,
which makes him think that they will spoil all, and bring things into a
warr again if they can. So to bed.
