business of tickets. So to White Hall, where waited on the Duke of York,
and then the Council about that business; and I did discourse to their
liking, only was too high to assert that nothing could be invented to
secure the King more in the business of tickets than there is; which the
Duke of Buckingham did except against, and I could have answered, but

to the Kingâ€™s House to see a play revived called The------, a sorry mean

Thence to see Betty Michell newly lain in, and after a little stay we
took water and to Spring Garden, and there walked, and supped, and staid
late, and with much pleasure, and to bed. The weather excessive hot, so
as we were forced to lie in two beds, and I only with a sheet and rug,
which is colder than ever I remember I could bear.
