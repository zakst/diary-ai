13th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, where young Lowther come to church
with Sir W. Pen and his Lady and daughter, and my wife tells me that
either they are married or the match is quite perfected, which I am apt
to believe, because all the peoples’ eyes in the church were much fixed
upon them. At noon sent for Mercer, who dined with us, and very merry,
and so I, after dinner, walked to the Old Swan, thinking to have got
a boat to White Hall, but could not, nor was there anybody at home at
Michell’s, where I thought to have sat with her.... So home, to church,
a dull sermon, and then home at my chamber all the evening. So to supper
and to bed.
