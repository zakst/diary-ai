30th. Up, and all day, both morning and afternoon, at my accounts, it
being a great month, both for profit and layings out, the last being L89
for kitchen and clothes for myself and wife, and a few extraordinaries
for the house; and my profits, besides salary, L239; so that I have this
weeke, notwithstanding great layings out, and preparations for laying
out, which I make as paid this month, my balance to come to L1203, for
which the Lord’s name be praised! Dined at home at noon, staying long
looking for Kate Joyce and my aunt James and Mary, but they came not. So
my wife abroad to see them, and took Mary Joyce to a play. Then in
the evening came and sat working by me at the office, and late home
to supper and to bed, with my heart in good rest for this day’s work,
though troubled to think that my last month’s negligence besides the
making me neglect business and spend money, and lessen myself both as
to business and the world and myself, I am fain to preserve my vowe by
paying 20s. dry--[ Dry = hard, as “hard cash.” ]--money into the poor’s
box, because I had not fulfilled all my memorandums and paid all my
petty debts and received all my petty credits, of the last month, but I
trust in God I shall do so no more.
