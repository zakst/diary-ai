10th. At the office all the morn, dined at home; then my wife into
Wood Street to buy a chest, and thence to buy other things at my uncle
Fenner’s (though by reason of rain we had ill walking), thence to my
brother Tom’s, and there discoursed with him about business, and so to
the Wardrobe to see my Lady, and after supper with the young ladies,
bought a link and carried it myself till I met one that would light me
home for the link. So he light me home with his own, and then I did give
him mine. This night I found Mary, my cozen W. Joyce’s maid, come to me
to be my cook maid, and so my house is full again. So to bed.
