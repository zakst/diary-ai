15th. So as I was not able to go to-day to wait on the Duke of York with
my fellows, but was forced in bed to write the particulars for their
discourse there, and kept my bed all day, and anon comes Mrs. Turner,
and new-dressed my foot, and did it so, that I was at much ease
presently, and so continued all day, so as I slept much and well in the
daytime, and in the evening rose and eat something, where our poor Jane
very sad for the death of her poor brother, who hath left a wife and two
small children. I did give her 20s. in money, and what wine she needed,
for the burying him. This evening come to see me Pelling, and we did
sing together, and he sings well indeed, and after supper I was willing
to go to bed to ease my foot again, which I did, and slept well all
night.
