8th. Up and called out by my Lord Peterborough’s gentleman to Mr. Povy’s
to discourse about getting of his money, wherein I am concerned in hopes
of the L50 my Lord hath promised me, but I dare not reckon myself sure
of it till I have it in my main,--[hand.]--for these Lords are hard to
be trusted. Though I well deserve it. I staid at Povy’s for his
coming in, and there looked over his stables and every thing, but
notwithstanding all the times I have been there I do yet find many fine
things to look on. Thence to White Hall a little, to hear how the King
do, he not having been well these three days. I find that he is pretty
well again. So to Paul’s Churchyarde about my books, and to the binder’s
and directed the doing of my Chaucer,

     [This was Speght’s edition of 1602, which is still in the Pepysian
     Library.  The book is bound in calf, with brass clasps and bosses.
     It is not lettered.]

though they were not full neate enough for me, but pretty well it is;
and thence to the clasp-maker’s to have it clasped and bossed. So to the
‘Change and home to dinner, and so to my office till 5 o’clock, and then
came Mr. Hill and Andrews, and we sung an houre or two. Then broke
up and Mr. Alsop and his company came and consulted about our Tangier
victualling and brought it to a good head. So they parted, and I to
supper and to bed.
