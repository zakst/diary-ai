20th. Up to Huntingdon this morning to Sir Robert Bernard, with whom I
met Jaspar Trice. So Sir Robert caused us to sit down together and began
discourse very fairly between us, so I drew out the Will and show it
him, and [he] spoke between us as well as I could desire, but could come
to no issue till Tom Trice comes. Then Sir Robert and I fell to talk
about the money due to us upon surrender from Piggott, L164., which he
tells me will go with debts to the heir at law, which breaks my heart on
the other side. Here I staid and dined with Sir Robert Bernard and his
lady, my Lady Digby, a very good woman. After dinner I went into the
town and spent the afternoon, sometimes with Mr. Phillips, sometimes
with Dr. Symcottes, Mr. Vinter, Robert Ethell, and many more friends,
and at last Mr. Davenport, Phillips, Jaspar Trice, myself and others
at Mother-----over against the Crown we sat and drank ale and were very
merry till 9 at night, and so broke up. I walked home, and there found
Tom Trice come, and he and my father gone to Goody Gorumâ€™s, where I
found them and Jaspar Trice got before me, and Mr. Greene, and there had
some calm discourse, but came to no issue, and so parted. So home and to
bed, being now pretty well again of my left hand, which lately was stung
and very much swelled.
