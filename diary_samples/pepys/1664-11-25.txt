25th. Up and at my office all the morning, to prepare an account of the
charge we have been put to extraordinary by the Dutch already; and I
have brought it to appear L852,700; but God knows this is only a scare
to the Parliament, to make them give the more money. Thence to the
Parliament House, and there did give it to Sir Philip Warwicke; the
House being hot upon giving the King a supply of money, and I by
coach to the ‘Change and took up Mr. Jenings along with me (my old
acquaintance), he telling me the mean manner that Sir Samuel Morland
lives near him, in a house he hath bought and laid out money upon, in
all to the value of L1200, but is believed to be a beggar; and so I ever
thought he would be. From the ‘Change with Mr. Deering and Luellin to
the White Horse tavern in Lombard Street, and there dined with them, he
giving me a dish of meat to discourse in order to my serving Deering,
which I am already obliged to do, and shall do it, and would be glad he
were a man trusty that I might venture something along with him. Thence
home, and by and by in the evening took my wife out by coach, leaving
her at Unthanke’s while I to White Hall and to Westminster Hall, where
I have not been to talk a great while, and there hear that Mrs. Lane and
her husband live a sad life together, and he is gone to be a paymaster
to a company to Portsmouth to serve at sea. She big with child. Thence
I home, calling my wife, and at Sir W. Batten’s hear that the House have
given the King L2,500,000 to be paid for this warr, only for the Navy,
in three years’ time; which is a joyfull thing to all the King’s party
I see, but was much opposed by Mr. Vaughan and others, that it should be
so much. So home and to supper and to bed.
