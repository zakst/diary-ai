13th. Up and to my office, at noon (after having at an alehouse hard
by discoursed with one Mr. Tyler, a neighbour, and one Captain Sanders
about the discovery of some pursers that have sold their provisions) I
to my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there, but they not dining
at home, I with Captain Ferrers to Mr. Barwell the Kingâ€™s Squire Sadler,
where about this time twelvemonths I dined before at a good venison
pasty. The like we had now, and very good company, Mr. Tresham and
others. Thence to White Hall to the Fishery, and there did little. So
by water home, and there met Lanyon, &c., about Tangier matters, and
so late to my office, and thence home and to bed. Mr. Moore was with me
late to desire me to come to my Lord Sandwich tomorrow morning, which I
shall, but I wonder what my business is.
