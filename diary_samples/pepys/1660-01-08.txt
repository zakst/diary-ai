8th. Out early, took horses at Deale. I troubled much with the King’s
gittar, and Fairbrother, the rogue that I intrusted with the carrying of
it on foot, whom I thought I had lost. Col. Dixwell’s horse taken by a
soldier and delivered to my Lord, and by him to me to carry to London.
Came to Canterbury, dined there. I saw the minster and the remains of
Becket’s tomb. To Sittiligborne and Rochester. At Chatham and Rochester
the ships and bridge. Mr. Hetly’s mistake about dinner. Come to
Gravesend. A good handsome wench I kissed, the first that I have seen
a great while. Supped with my Lord, drank late below with Penrose,
the Captain. To bed late, having first laid out all my things against
to-morrow to put myself in a walking garb. Weary and hot to bed to Mr.
Moore.
