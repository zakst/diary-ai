21st. To White Hall to the Privy Seal, where my Lord Privy Seal did tell
us he could seal no more this month, for that he goes thirty miles out
of town to keep his Christmas. At which I was glad, but only afeard lest
any thing of the King’s should force us to go after him to get a seal
in the country. Thence to Westminster Hall (having by the way drank with
Mrs. Sarah and Mrs. Betty at my Lord’s lodgings), and thence taken by
some Exchequer men to the Dogg, where, being St. Thomas’s day, by custom
they have a general meeting at dinner. There I was and all very merry,
and there I spoke to Mr. Falconberge to look whether he could out of
Domesday Book, give me any thing concerning the sea, and the dominion
thereof; which he says he will look after. Thence taking leave to my
brother’s, and there by appointment met with Prior of Brampton who had
money to pay me, but desiring some advice he stays till Monday. So by
coach home to the office, where I was vexed to see Sir Williams both
seem to think so much that I should be a little out of the way, saying
that without their Register they were not a Committee, which I took
in some dudgeon, and see clearly that I must keep myself at a little
distance with them and not crouch, or else I shall never keep myself up
even with them. So home and wrote letters by the post. This evening my
wife come home from christening Mrs. Hunt’s son, his name John, and
a merchant in Mark Lane came along with her, that was her partner. So
after my business was done, and read something in Mr. Selden, I went to
bed.
