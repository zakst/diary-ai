5th. At the office all the morning. At noon comes my brother Tom and Mr.
Armiger to dine with me, and did, and we were very merry. After dinner,
I having drunk a great deal of wine, I went away, seeming to go about
business with Sir W. Pen, to my Lady Batten’s (Sir William being at
Chatham), and there sat a good while, and then went away (before I went
I called at home to see whether they were gone, and found them there,
and Armiger inviting my wife to go to a play, and like a fool would be
courting her, but he is an ass, and lays out money with Tom, otherwise
I should not think him worth half this respect I shew him). To the
Dolphin, where he and I and Captain Cocke sat late and drank much,
seeing the boys in the streets flying their crackers, this day being
kept all the day very strictly in the City. At last broke up, and called
at my Lady Batten’s again and would have gone to cards, but Sir W.
Pen was so fuddled that we could not try him to play, and therefore we
parted, and I home and to bed.
