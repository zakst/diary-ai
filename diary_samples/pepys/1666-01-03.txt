3rd. Up, and all the morning till three in the afternoon examining and
fitting up my Pursers’ paper and sent it away by an Expresse. Then comes
my wife, and I set her to get supper ready against I go to the Duke of
Albemarle and back again; and at the Duke’s with great joy I received
the good news of the decrease of the plague this week to 70, and but 253
in all; which is the least Bill hath been known these twenty years in
the City. Through the want of people in London is it, that must make
it so low below the ordinary number for Bills. So home, and find all my
good company I had bespoke, as Coleman and his wife, and Laneare, Knipp
and her surly husband; and good musique we had, and, among other things,
Mrs. Coleman sang my words I set of “Beauty retire,” and I think it is a
good song, and they praise it mightily. Then to dancing and supper, and
mighty merry till Mr. Rolt come in, whose pain of the tooth-ake made him
no company, and spoilt ours; so he away, and then my wife’s teeth fell
of akeing, and she to bed. So forced to break up all with a good song,
and so to bed.
