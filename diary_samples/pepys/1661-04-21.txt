21st (Lord’s day). In the morning we were troubled to hear it rain as it
did, because of the great show tomorrow. After I was ready I walked to
my father’s and there found the late maid to be gone and another come by
my mother’s choice, which my father do not like, and so great difference
there will be between my father and mother about it. Here dined Doctor
Thos. Pepys and Dr. Fayrebrother; and all our talk about to-morrow’s
show, and our trouble that it is like to be a wet day. After dinner
comes in my coz. Snow and his wife, and I think stay there till the show
be over. Then I went home, and all the way is so thronged with people
to see the triumphal arches, that I could hardly pass for them. So home,
people being at church, and I got home unseen, and so up to my chamber
and saw done these last five or six days’ diarys. My mind a little
troubled about my workmen, which, being foreigners,--[Foreigners were
workmen dwelling outside the city.]--are like to be troubled by a couple
of lazy rogues that worked with me the other day, that are citizens, and
so my work will be hindered, but I must prevent it if I can.
