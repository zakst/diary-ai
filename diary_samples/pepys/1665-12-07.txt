letter tells me my Lord Sandwich is, as I was told, declared Embassador
Extraordinary to Spayne, and to go with all speed away, and that his
enemies have done him as much good as he could wish. At noon late to

discoursing and making myself more fully [know] the trade of pursers,
and what fittest to be done in their business, and so to the office till
midnight writing letters, and so home, and after supper with my wife
about one o’clock to bed.
