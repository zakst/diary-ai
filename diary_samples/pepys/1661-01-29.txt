29th. Mr. Moore making up accounts with me all this morning till Lieut.
Lambert came, and so with them over the water to Southwark, and so over
the fields to Lambeth, and there drank, it being a most glorious and
warm day, even to amazement, for this time of the year. Thence to my
Lord’s, where we found my Lady gone with some company to see Hampton
Court, so we three went to Blackfryers (the first time I ever was
there since plays begun), and there after great patience and little
expectation, from so poor beginning, I saw three acts of “The Mayd in ye
Mill” acted to my great content. But it being late, I left the play and
them, and by water through bridge home, and so to Mr. Turner’s house,
where the Comptroller, Sir William Batten, and Mr. Davis and their
ladies; and here we had a most neat little but costly and genteel
supper, and after that a great deal of impertinent mirth by Mr. Davis,
and some catches, and so broke up, and going away, Mr. Davis’s eldest
son took up my old Lady Slingsby in his arms, and carried her to the
coach, and is said to be able to carry three of the biggest men that
were in the company, which I wonder at. So home and to bed.
