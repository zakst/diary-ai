29th. Took two pills more in the morning and they worked all day, and I
kept the house. About noon dined, and then to carry several heavy things
with my wife up and down stairs, in order to our going to lie above, and
Will to come down to the Wardrobe, and that put me into a violent sweat,
so I had a fire made, and then, being dry again, she and I to put up
some paper pictures in the red chamber, where we go to lie very pretty,
and the map of Paris. Then in the evening, towards night, it fell to
thunder, lighten, and rain so violently that my house was all afloat,
and I in all the rain up to the gutters, and there dabbled in the rain
and wet half an hour, enough to have killed a man. That done downstairs
to dry myself again, and by and by come Mr. Sympson to set up my wifeâ€™s
chimney-piece in her closett, which pleases me, and so that being done,
I to supper and to bed, shifting myself from top to toe, and doubtful of
my doing myself hurt.
