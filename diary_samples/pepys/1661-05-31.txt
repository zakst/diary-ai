31st. I went to my fatherâ€™s thinking to have met with my cozen John
Holcroft, but he came not, but to my great grief I found my father and
mother in a great deal of discontent one with another, and indeed my
mother is grown now so pettish that I know not how my father is able to
bear with it. I did talk to her so as did not indeed become me, but I
could not help it, she being so unsufferably foolish and simple, so that
my father, poor man, is become a very unhappy man. There I dined, and so
home and to the office all the afternoon till 9 at night, and then home
and to supper and to bed. Great talk now how the Parliament intend to
make a collection of free gifts to the King through the Kingdom; but I
think it will not come to much.
