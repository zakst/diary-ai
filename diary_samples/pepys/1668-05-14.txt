14th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
home to dinner with my people, but did not stay to dine out with them,
but rose and straight by water to the Temple, and so to Penny’s, my
tailor’s, where by and by by agreement Mercer, and she, to my great
content, brings Mrs. Gayet, and I carried them to the King’s house; but,
coming too soon, we out again to the Rose taverne, and there I did give
them a tankard of cool drink, the weather being very hot, and then into
the playhouse again, and there saw “The Country Captain,” a very dull
play, that did give us no content, and besides, little company there,
which made it very unpleasing. Thence to the waterside, at Strand
bridge, and so up by water and to Fox-hall, where we walked a great
while, and pleased mightily with the pleasure thereof, and the company
there, and then in, and eat and drank, and then out again and walked,
and it beginning to be dark, we to a corner and sang, that everybody got
about us to hear us; and so home, where I saw them both at their doors,
and, full of the content of this afternoon’s pleasure, I home and to
walk in the garden a little, and so home to bed.
