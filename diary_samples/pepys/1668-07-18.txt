18th. At the office all the morning. At noon dined at home and Creed
with me, who I do really begin to hate, and do use him with some
reservedness. Here was also my old acquaintance, Will Swan, to see me,
who continues a factious fanatick still, and I do use him civilly,
in expectation that those fellows may grow great again. Thence to the
office, and then with my wife to the ‘Change and Unthanke’s, after
having been at Cooper’s and sat there for her picture, which will be a
noble picture, but yet I think not so like as Hales’s is. So home and
to my office, and then to walk in the garden, and home to supper and
to bed. They say the King of France is making a war again, in Flanders,
with the King of Spain; the King of Spain refusing to give him all that
he says was promised him in the treaty. Creed told me this day how when
the King was at my Lord Cornwallis’s when he went last to Newmarket,
that being there on a Sunday, the Duke of Buckingham did in the
afternoon to please the King make a bawdy sermon to him out of
Canticles, and that my Lord Cornwallis did endeavour to get the King a
whore, and that must be a pretty girl the daughter of the parson of
the place, but that she did get away, and leaped off of some place and
killed herself, which if true is very sad.
