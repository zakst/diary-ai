20th. Up and to the Office, where all the morning. At noon, the whole
Office--Brouncker, J. Minnes, T. Middleton, Samuel Pepys, and Captain
Cox to dine with the Parish, at the Three Tuns, this day being
Ascension-day, where exceeding good discourse among the merchants, and
thence back home, and after a little talk with my wife, to my office did
a great deal of business, and so with my eyes might weary, and my head
full of care how to get my accounts and business settled against my
journey, home to supper, and bed. Yesterday, at my coming home, I found
that my wife had, on a sudden, put away Matt upon some falling out, and
I doubt my wife did call her ill names by my wifeâ€™s own discourse; but I
did not meddle to say anything upon it, but let her go, being not sorry,
because now we may get one that speaks French, to go abroad with us.
