12th. We lay long in bed, then up and made me ready, and by and by come
Will Bowyer and Mr. Gregory, my old Exchequer friend, to see me, and I
took them to the Dolphin and there did give them a good morning draft,
and so parted, and invited them and all my old Exchequer acquaintance
to come and dine with me there on Wednesday next. From thence to the
Wardrobe and dined with my Lady, where her brother, Mr. John Crew, dined
also, and a strange gentlewoman dined at the table as a servant of my
Lady’s; but I knew her not, and so I am afeard that poor Madamoiselle
was gone, but I since understand that she is come as housekeeper to my
Lady, and is a married woman. From thence to Westminster to my Lord’s
house to meet my Lord Privy Seal, who appointed to seal there this
afternoon, but by and by word is brought that he is come to Whitehall,
and so we are fain to go thither to him, and there we staid to seal till
it was so late that though I got leave to go away before he had done,
yet the office was done before I could get thither, and so to Sir W.
Pen’s, and there sat and talked and drank with him, and so home.
