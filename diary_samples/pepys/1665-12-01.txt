December 1st. This morning to the office, full of resolution to spend
the whole day at business, and there, among other things, I did agree
with Poynter to be my clerke for my Victualling business, and so all
alone all the day long shut up in my little closett at my office,
drawing up instructions, which I should long since have done for my
Surveyours of the Ports, Sir W. Coventry desiring much to have them, and
he might well have expected them long since. After dinner to it again,
and at night had long discourse with Gibson, who is for Yarmouth, who
makes me understand so much of the victualling business and the pursersâ€™
trade, that I am ashamed I should go about the concerning myself in a
business which I understand so very very little of, and made me distrust
all I had been doing to-day. So I did lay it by till to-morrow morning
to think of it afresh, and so home by promise to my wife, to have mirth
there. So we had our neighbours, little Miss Tooker and Mrs. Daniels, to
dance, and after supper I to bed, and left them merry below, which they
did not part from till two or three in the morning.
