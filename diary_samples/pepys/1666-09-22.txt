22nd. Up, and by coach to Westminster Hall, there thinking to have met
Betty Michell, who I heard yesterday staid all night at her father’s,
but she was gone. So I staid a little and then down to the bridge by
water, and there overtook her and her father. So saluted her and walked
over London Bridge with them and there parted, the weather being very
foul, and so to the Tower by water, and so heme, where I find Mr. Caesar
playing the treble to my boy upon the Theorbo, the first time I heard
him, which pleases me mightily. After dinner I carried him and my wife
towards Westminster, by coach, myself ‘lighting at the Temple, and
there, being a little too soon, walked in the Temple Church, looking
with pleasure on the monuments and epitaphs, and then to my Lord
Belasses, where Creed and Povy by appointment met to discourse of some
of their Tangier accounts between my Lord and Vernatty, who will prove a
very knave. That being done I away with Povy to White Hall, and thence
I to Unthanke’s, and there take up my wife, and so home, it being very
foule and darke. Being there come, I to the settling of some of my money
matters in my chests, and evening some accounts, which I was at late, to
my extraordinary content, and especially to see all things hit so
even and right and with an apparent profit and advantage since my last
accounting, but how much I cannot particularly yet come to adjudge.
