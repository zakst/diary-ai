27th. Up (taking Balty with me, who lay at my house last [night] in
order to his going away to-day to sea with the pursers of the Henery,
whom I appointed to call him), abroad to many several places about
several businesses, to my Lord Treasurer’s, Westminster, and I know not
where. At noon to the ‘Change a little, and there bespoke some maps to
hang in my new roome (my boy’s roome) which will be very-pretty. Home to
dinner, and after dinner to the hanging up of maps, and other things
for the fitting of the roome, and now it will certainly be one of the
handsomest and most usefull roomes in my house. So that what with this
room and the room on my leads my house is half as good again as it was.
All this afternoon about this till I was so weary and it was late I
could do no more but finished the room. So I did not get out to the
office all the day long. At night spent a good deale of time with my
wife and Mercer teaching them a song, and so after supper to bed.
