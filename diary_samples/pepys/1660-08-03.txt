3rd. Up betimes this morning, and after the barber had done with me,
then to the office, where I and Sir William Pen only did meet and
despatch business. At noon my wife and I by coach to Dr. Clerke’s to
dinner: I was very much taken with his lady, a comely, proper woman,
though not handsome; but a woman of the best language I ever heard. Here
dined Mrs. Pierce and her husband. After dinner I took leave to go
to Westminster, where I was at the Privy Seal Office all day, signing
things and taking money, so that I could not do as I had intended, that
is to return to them and go to the Red Bull Playhouse,

     [This well-known theatre was situated in St. John’s Street on the
     site of Red Bull Yard.  Pepys went there on March 23rd, 1661, when
     he expressed a very poor opinion of the place.  T. Carew, in some
     commendatory lines on Sir William.  Davenant’s play, “The just
     Italian,” 1630, abuses both audiences and actors:--

              “There are the men in crowded heaps that throng
               To that adulterate stage, where not a tongue
               Of th’ untun’d kennel can a line repeat
               Of serious sense.”

     There is a token of this house (see “Boyne’s Trade Tokens,” ed.
     Williamson, vol. i., 1889, p. 725).]

but I took coach and went to see whether it was done so or no, and I
found it done. So I returned to Dr. Clerke’s, where I found them and my
wife, and by and by took leave and went away home.
