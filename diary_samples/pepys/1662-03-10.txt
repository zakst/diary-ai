10th. At the office doing business all the morning, and my wife being
gone to buy some things in the city I dined with Sir W. Batten, and in
the afternoon met Sir W. Pen at the Treasury Office, and there paid off
the Guift, where late at night, and so called in and eat a bit at Sir W.
Battenâ€™s again, and so home and to bed, to-morrow being washing day.
