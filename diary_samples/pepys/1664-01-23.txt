23rd. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, where Mr. Hawly came to see us and dined with us, and after
we had dined came Mr. Mallard, and after he had eat something, I brought
down my vyall which he played on, the first maister that ever touched
her yet, and she proves very well and will be, I think, an admirable
instrument. He played some very fine things of his owne, but I was
afeard to enter too far in their commendation for fear he should
offer to copy them for me out, and so I be forced to give or lend him
something. So to the office in the evening, whither Mr. Commander came
to me, and we discoursed about my will, which I am resolved to perfect
the next week by the grace of God. He being gone, I to write letters and
other business late, and so home to supper and to bed.
