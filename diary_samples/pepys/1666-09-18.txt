18th. Strange with what freedom and quantity I pissed this night, which
I know not what to impute to but my oysters, unless the coldness of the
night should cause it, for it was a sad rainy and tempestuous night.
Soon as up I begun to have some pain in my bladder and belly, as usual,
which made me go to dinner betimes, to fill my belly, and that did ease
me, so as I did my business in the afternoon, in forwarding the settling
of my house, very well. Betimes to bed, my wife also being all this day
ill in the same manner. Troubled at my wifeâ€™s haire coming off so much.
This day the Parliament met, and adjourned till Friday, when the King
will be with them.
