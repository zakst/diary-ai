24th (Midsummer-day). We kept this a holiday, and so went not to the
office at all. All the morning at home. At noon my father came to see my
house now it is done, which is now very neat. He and I and Dr. Williams
(who is come to see my wife, whose soare belly is now grown dangerous
as she thinks) to the ordinary over against the Exchange, where we dined
and had great wrangling with the master of the house when the reckoning
was brought to us, he setting down exceeding high every thing. I home
again and to Sir W. Battenâ€™s, and there sat a good while. So home.
