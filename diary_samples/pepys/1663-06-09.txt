9th. Up and after ordering some things towards my wife’s going into
the country, to the office, where I spent the morning upon my measuring
rules very pleasantly till noon, and then comes Creed and he and I
talked about mathematiques, and he tells me of a way found out by Mr.
Jonas Moore which he calls duodecimal arithmetique, which is properly
applied to measuring, where all is ordered by inches, which are 12 in
a foot, which I have a mind to learn. So he with me home to dinner and
after dinner walk in the garden, and then we met at the office, where
Coventry, Sir J. Minnes, and I, and so in the evening, business done, I
went home and spent my time till night with my wife. Presently after my
coming home comes Pembleton, whether by appointment or no I know not,
or whether by a former promise that he would come once before my wife’s
going into the country, but I took no notice of, let them go up and
Ashwell with them to dance, which they did, and I staid below in my
chamber, but, Lord! how I listened and laid my ear to the door, and how
I was troubled when I heard them stand still and not dance. Anon they
made an end and had done, and so I suffered him to go away, and spoke
not to him, though troubled in my mind, but showed no discontent to my
wife, believing that this is the last time I shall be troubled with him.
So my wife and I to walk in the garden, home and to supper and to bed.
