15th. Up, and my wife not come home all night. To the office, where sat
all the morning. At noon to Starky’s, a great cooke in Austin Friars,
invited by Colonell Atkins, and a good dinner for Colonell Norwood
and his friends, among others Sir Edward Spragg and others, but ill
attendance. Before dined, called on by my wife in a coach, and so I took
leave, and then with her and Knipp and Mercer (Mr. Hunt newly come
out of the country being there also come to see us) to Mr. Hales, the
paynter’s, having set down Mr. Hunt by the way. Here Mr. Hales’ begun my
wife in the posture we saw one of my Lady Peters, like a St. Katharine.

     [It was the fashion at this time to be painted as St. Catherine, in
     compliment to the queen.]

While he painted, Knipp, and Mercer, and I, sang; and by and by comes
Mrs. Pierce, with my name in her bosom for her Valentine, which will
cost me money. But strange how like his very first dead colouring is,
that it did me good to see it, and pleases me mightily, and I believe
will be a noble picture. Thence with them all as far as Fleete Streete,
and there set Mercer and Knipp down, and we home. I to the office,
whither the Houblons come telling me of a little new trouble from
Norwood about their ship, which troubles me, though without reason. So
late home to supper and to bed. We hear this night of Sir Jeremy Smith,
that he and his fleete have been seen at Malaga; which is good newes.
