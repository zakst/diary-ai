12th. Called up before day, and so I dressed myself and down, it being
horrid cold, by water to my Lord Bruncker’s ship, who advised me to do
so, and it was civilly to show me what the King had commanded about
the prize-goods, to examine most severely all that had been done in
the taking out any with or without order, without respect to my
Lord Sandwich at all, and that he had been doing of it, and find him
examining one man, and I do find that extreme ill use was made of my
Lord’s order. For they did toss and tumble and spoil, and breake things
in hold to a great losse and shame to come at the fine goods, and did
take a man that knows where the fine goods were, and did this over and
over again for many days, Sir W. Berkeley being the chief hand that did
it, but others did the like at other times, and they did say in doing it
that my Lord Sandwich’s back was broad enough to bear it. Having learned
as much as I could, which was, that the King and Duke were very
severe in this point, whatever order they before had given my Lord in
approbation of what he had done, and that all will come out and the King
see, by the entries at the Custome House, what all do amount to that
had been taken, and so I took leave, and by water, very cold, and to
Woolwich where it was now noon, and so I staid dinner and talking part
of the afternoon, and then by coach, Captain Cocke’s, to Greenwich,
taking the young lady home, and so to Cocke, and he tells me that he
hath cajolled with Seymour, who will be our friend; but that, above all,
Seymour tells him, that my Lord Duke did shew him to-day an order from
Court, for having all respect paid to the Earle of Sandwich, and what
goods had been delivered by his order, which do overjoy us, and that
to-morrow our goods shall be weighed, and he doubts not possession
to-morrow or next day. Being overjoyed at this I to write my letters,
and at it very late. Good newes this week that there are about 600 less
dead of the plague than the last. So home to bed.
