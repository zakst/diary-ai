19th. We met at the office this morning about some particular business,
and then I to Whitehall, and there dined with my Lord, and after dinner
Mr. Creed and I to White-Fryars, where we saw “The Bondman” acted most
excellently, and though I have seen it often, yet I am every time more
and more pleased with Betterton’s action. From thence with him and young
Mr. Jones to Penell’s in Fleet Street, and there we drank and talked a
good while, and so I home and to bed.
