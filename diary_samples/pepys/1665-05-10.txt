10th. Up betimes, and abroad to the Cocke-Pitt, where the Duke [of
Albemarle] did give Sir W. Batten and me an account of the late taking
of eight ships, and of his intent to come back to the Gunfleete--[The
Gunfleet Sand off the Essex coast.]--with the fleete presently; which
creates us much work and haste therein, against the fleete comes. So to
Mr. Povy, and after discourse with him home, and thence to the Guard in
Southwarke, there to get some soldiers, by the Duke’s order, to go keep
pressmen on board our ships. So to the ‘Change and did much business,
and then home to dinner, and there find my poor mother come out of the
country today in good health, and I am glad to see her, but my business,
which I am sorry for, keeps me from paying the respect I ought to her
at her first coming, she being grown very weak in her judgement, and
doating again in her discourse, through age and some trouble in her
family. I left her and my wife to go abroad to buy something, and then
I to my office. In the evening by appointment to Sir W. Warren and Mr.
Deering at a taverne hard by with intent to do some good upon their
agreement in a great bargain of planks. So home to my office again, and
then to supper and to bed, my mother being in bed already.
