10th. Up and to the office, where we sate all the morning, and I much
troubled to think what the end of our great sluggishness will be, for we
do nothing in this office like people able to carry on a warr. We must
be put out, or other people put in. Dined at home, and then my wife and
I and Mercer to the Duke’s house, and there saw “The Rivalls,” which is
no excellent play, but good acting in it; especially Gosnell comes and
sings and dances finely, but, for all that, fell out of the key, so that
the musique could not play to her afterwards, and so did Harris also go
out of the tune to agree with her. Thence home and late writing letters,
and this night I received, by Will, L105, the first-fruits of my
endeavours in the late contract for victualling of Tangier, for which
God be praised! for I can with a safe conscience say that I have therein
saved the King L5000 per annum, and yet got myself a hope of L300 per
annum without the least wrong to the King. So to supper and to bed.
