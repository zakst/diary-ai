30th. Up and to the office, at noon home to dinner, and all the
afternoon to my accounts again, and there find myself, to my great joy,
a great deal worth above L4000, for which the Lord be praised! and is
principally occasioned by my getting L500 of Cocke, for my profit in his
bargains of prize goods, and from Mr. Gawdenâ€™s making me a present of
L500 more, when I paid him 8000 for Tangier. So to my office to write
letters, then to my accounts again, and so to bed, being in great ease
of mind.
