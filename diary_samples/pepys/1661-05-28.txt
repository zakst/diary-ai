28th. This morning to the Wardrobe, and thence to a little alehouse hard
by, to drink with John Bowies, who is now going to Hinchinbroke this
day. Thence with Mr. Shepley to the Exchange about business, and there,
by Mr. Rawlinson’s favour, got into a balcone over against the Exchange;
and there saw the hangman burn, by vote of Parliament, two old acts, the
one for constituting us a Commonwealth, and the others I have forgot.
Which still do make me think of the greatness of this late turn, and
what people will do tomorrow against what they all, through profit or
fear, did promise and practise this day. Then to the Mitre with Mr.
Shepley, and there dined with D. Rawlinson and some friends of his very
well. So home, and then to Cheapside about buying a piece of plate to
give away to-morrow to Mrs. Browne’s child. So to the Star in Cheapside,
where I left Mr. Moore telling L5 out for me, who I found in a great
strait for my coming back again, and so he went his way at my coming.
Then home, where Mr. Cook I met and he paid me 30s., an old debt of
his to me. So to Sir W. Pen’s, and there sat alone with him till ten at
night in talk with great content, he telling me things and persons that
I did not understand in the late times, and so I home to bed. My cozen
John Holcroft (whom I have not seen many years) this morning came to see
me.
