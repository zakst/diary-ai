18th. Up, and to St. James’s, and there took a turn or two in the Park;
and then up to the Duke of York, and there had opportunity of delivering
my answer to his late letter, which he did not read, but give to Mr.
Wren, as looking on it as a thing I needed not have done, but only that
I might not give occasion to the rest to suspect my communication with
the Duke of York against them. So now I am at rest in that matter, and
shall be more, when my copies are finished of their answers, which I
am now taking with all speed. Thence to my several booksellers and
elsewhere, about several errands, and so at noon home, and after dinner
by coach to White Hall, and thither comes the Duke of York to us, and by
and by met at the robe chamber upon our usual business, where the Duke
of York I find somewhat sour, and particularly angry with Lord Anglesey
for his not being there now, nor at other times so often as he should be
with us. So to the King’s house, and saw a piece of “Henry the Fourth;”
 at the end of the play, thinking to have gone abroad with Knepp, but it
was too late, and she to get her part against to-morrow, in “The Silent
Woman,” and so I only set her at home, and away home myself, and there
to read again and sup with Gibson, and so to bed.
