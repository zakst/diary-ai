12th. Up early and by coach to White Hall with Commissioner Pett, where,
after we had talked with my Lord, I went to the Privy Seal and got my
bill perfected there, and at the Signet: and then to the House of Lords,
and met with Mr. Kipps, who directed me to Mr. Beale to get my patent
engrossed; but he not having time to get it done in Chancery-hand, I was
forced to run all up and down Chancery-lane, and the Six Clerks’ Office

     [The Six Clerks’ Office was in Chancery Lane, near the Holborn end.
     The business of the office was to enrol commissions, pardons,
     patents, warrants, &c., that had passed the Great Seal; also other
     business in Chancery.  In the early history of the Court of
     Chancery, the Six Clerks and their under-clerks appear to have acted
     as the attorneys of the suitors.  As business increased, these
     under-clerks became a distinct body, and were recognized by the
     court under the denomination of ‘sworn clerks,’ or ‘clerks in
     court.’  The advance of commerce, with its consequent accession of
     wealth, so multiplied the subjects requiring the judgment of a Court
     of Equity, that the limits of a public office were found wholly
     inadequate to supply a sufficient number of officers to conduct the
     business of the suitors.  Hence originated the ‘Solicitors’ of the
     “Court of Chancery.”  See Smith’s “Chancery Practice,” p. 62, 3rd
     edit.  The “Six Clerks” were abolished by act of Parliament,
