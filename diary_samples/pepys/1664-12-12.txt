Till 12 at night, and then home to supper and to bed
     To my Lord Sandwich, thinking to have dined there
     Travels over the high hills in Asia above the clouds
     Up, my mind very light from my last nightâ€™s accounts
     Upon a very small occasion had a difference again broke out
     Very angry we were, but quickly friends again
     Very high and very foule words from her to me
     We do nothing in this office like people able to carry on a warr
     Went against me to have my wife and servants look upon them
     What wine you drinke, lett it bee at meales
     What a sorry dispatch these great persons give to business
     What is there more to be had of a woman than the possessing her
     Where a trade hath once been and do decay, it never recovers
     Wherein every party has laboured to cheat another
     Willing to receive a bribe if it were offered me
     Would either conform, or be more wise, and not be catched!
     Would make a dogg laugh
