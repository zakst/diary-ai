15th. At the office all the morning, and in the afternoon to Paulâ€™s
Churchyard to a blind place, where Mrs. Goldsborough was to meet me (who
dare not be known where she lives) to treat about the difference which
remains between my uncle and her. But, Lord! to hear how she talks and
how she rails against my uncle would make one mad. But I seemed not to
be troubled at it, but would indeed gladly have an agreement with her.
So I appoint Mr. Moore and she another against Friday next to look into
our papers and to see what can be done to conclude the matter. So home
in much pain by walking too much yesterday.... which much troubles me.
