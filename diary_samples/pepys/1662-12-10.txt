10th. This morning rose, receiving a messenger from Sir G. Carteret and
a letter from Mr. Coventry, one contrary to another, about our letter to
my Lord Treasurer, at which I am troubled, but I went to Sir George, and
being desirous to please both, I think I have found out a way to do it.
So back to the office with Sir J. Minnes, in his coach, but so great a
snow that we could hardly pass the streets. So we and Sir W. Batten to
the office, and there did discourse of Mr. Creed’s accounts, and I fear
it will be a good while before we shall go through them, and many things
we meet with, all of difficulty. Then to the Dolphin, where Sir J.
Minnes, Sir W. Batten, and I, did treat the Auditors of the Exchequer,
Auditors Wood and Beale, and hither come Sir G. Carteret to us. We had a
good dinner, cost us L5 and 6s., whereof my share 26s., and after dinner
did discourse of our salarys and other matters, which I think now they
will allow. Thence home, and there I found our new cook-mayde Susan
come, who is recommended to us by my wife’s brother, for which I like
her never the better, but being a good well-looked lass, I am willing
to try, and Jane begins to take upon her as a chamber-mayde. So to the
office, where late putting papers and my books and businesses in order,
it being very cold, and so home to supper.
