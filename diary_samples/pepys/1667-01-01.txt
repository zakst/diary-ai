January 1st. Lay long, being a bitter, cold, frosty day, the frost being
now grown old, and the Thames covered with ice. Up, and to the office,
where all the morning busy. At noon to the ‘Change a little, where Mr.
James Houblon and I walked a good while speaking of our ill condition in
not being able to set out a fleet (we doubt) this year, and the certain
ill effect that must bring, which is lamentable. Home to dinner, where
the best powdered goose that ever I eat. Then to the office again, and
to Sir W. Batten’s to examine the Commission going down to Portsmouth to
examine witnesses about our prizes, of which God give a good issue!
and then to the office again, where late, and so home, my eyes sore. To
supper and to bed.
