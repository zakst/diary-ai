19th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and all the morning and afternoon (only at dinner
at home) at my office doing many businesses for want of time on the week
days. In the afternoon the greatest shower of rain of a sudden and the
greatest and most continued thunder that ever I heard I think in my
life. In the evening home to my wife, and there talked seriously of
several of our family concernments, and among others of bringing Pall
out of the country to us here to try to put her off, which I am very
desirous, and my wife also of. So to supper, prayers, which I have of
late too much omitted. So to bed.
