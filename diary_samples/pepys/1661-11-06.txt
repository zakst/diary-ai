6th. Going forth this morning I met Mr. Davenport and a friend of his,
one Mr. Furbisher, to drink their morning draft with me, and I did give
it them in good wine, and anchovies, and pickled oysters, and took them
to the Sun in Fish Street, there did give them a barrel of good ones,
and a great deal of wine, and sent for Mr. W. Bernard (Sir Robert’s
son), a grocer thereabouts, and were very merry, and cost me a good
deal of money, and at noon left them, and with my head full of wine, and
being invited by a note from Luellin, that came to my hands this morning
in bed, I went to Nick Osborne’s at the Victualling Office, and there
saw his wife, who he has lately married, a good sober woman, and new
come to their home. We had a good dish or two of marrowbones and another
of neats’ tongues to dinner, and that being done I bade them adieu and
hastened to Whitehall (calling Mr. Moore by the way) to my Lord Privy
Seal, who will at last force the clerks to bring in a table of their
fees, which they have so long denied, but I do not join with them, and
so he is very respectful to me. So he desires me to bring in one which I
observe in making of fees, which I will speedily do. So back again,
and endeavoured to speak with Tom Trice (who I fear is hatching some
mischief), but could not, which vexed me, and so I went home and sat
late with pleasure at my lute, and so to bed.
