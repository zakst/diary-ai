16th. Early at Sir Wm. Pen’s, and there before Mr. Turner did reconcile
the business of the purveyance between us two. Then to Whitehall to my
Lord’s, and dined with him, and so to Whitefriars and saw “The Spanish
Curate,” in which I had no great content. So home, and was very much
troubled that Will. staid out late, and went to bed early, intending not
to let him come in, but by and by he comes and I did let him in, and he
did tell me that he was at Guildhall helping to pay off the seamen, and
cast the books late. Which since I found to be true. So to sleep, being
in bed when he came.
