30th. Up, and after drinking my morning draft with my father and W.
Stankes, I went forth to Sir W. Batten, who is going (to no purpose as
he uses to do) to Chatham upon a survey. So to my office, where till
towards noon, and then to the Exchange, and back home to dinner, where
Mrs. Hunt, my father, and W. Stankes; but, Lord! what a stir Stankes
makes with his being crowded in the streets and wearied in walking in
London, and would not be wooed by my wife and Ashwell to go to a play,
nor to White Hall, or to see the lyons,

     [The Tower menagerie, with its famous lions, which was one of the
     chief sights of London, and gave rise to a new English word, was not
     abolished until the early part of the present century.]

been upon earth a man so little curious in the world as he is. At the
office all the afternoon till 9 at night, so home to cards with my
father, wife, and Ashwell, and so to bed.
