30th. Within all the morning and dined at home, my mind being so
troubled that I could not mind nor do anything till I spoke with the
Comptroller to whom the lodgings belong. In the afternoon, to ease my
mind, I went to the Cockpit all alone, and there saw a very fine play
called “The Tamer Tamed;” very well acted. That being done, I went to
Mr. Crew’s, where I had left my boy, and so with him and Mr. Moore
(who would go a little way with me home, as he will always do) to the
Hercules Pillars to drink, where we did read over the King’s declaration
in matters of religion, which is come out to-day, which is very well
penned, I think to the satisfaction of most people. So home, where I
am told Mr. Davis’s people have broken open the bolt of my chamber door
that goes upon the leads, which I went up to see and did find it so,
which did still trouble me more and more. And so I sent for Griffith,
and got him to search their house to see what the meaning of it might
be, but can learn nothing to-night. But I am a little pleased that I
have found this out. I hear nothing yet of my Lord, whether he be gone
for the Queen from the Downs or no; but I believe he is, and that he is
now upon coming back again.
