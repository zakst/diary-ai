5th (Lord’s day). Lady Batten had sent twice to invite me to go with
them to Walthamstow to-day, Mrs. Martha’ being married already this
morning to Mr. Castle, at this parish church. I could not rise soon
enough to go with them, but got myself ready, and so to Games’s, where I
got a horse and rode thither very pleasantly, only coming to make water
I found a stopping, which makes me fearful of my old pain. Being come
thither, I was well received, and had two pair of gloves, as the rest,
and walked up and down with my Lady in the garden, she mighty kind
to me, and I have the way to please her. A good dinner and merry, but
methinks none of the kindness nor bridall respect between the bridegroom
and bride, that was between my wife and I, but as persons that marry
purely for convenience. After dinner to church by coach, and there my
Lady, Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Lemon, and I only, we, in spite to one another,
kept one another awake; and sometimes I read in my book of Latin plays,
which I took in my pocket, thinking to have walked it. An old doting
parson preached. So home again, and by and by up and homewards, calling
in our way (Sir J. Minnes and I only) at Mr. Batten’s (who with his lady
and child went in another coach by us), which is a very pretty house,
and himself in all things within and without very ingenious, and I find
a very fine study and good books. So set out, Sir J. Minnes and I in
his coach together, talking all the way of chymistry, wherein he do
know something, at least, seems so to me, that cannot correct him, Mr.
Batten’s man riding my horse, and so home and to my office a while to
read my vows, then home to prayers and to bed.
