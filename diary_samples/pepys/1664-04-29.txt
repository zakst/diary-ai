29th. Up betimes, and with Sir W. Rider and Cutler to White Hall. Rider
and I to St. James’s, and there with Mr. Coventry did proceed strictly
upon some fooleries of Mr. Povy’s in my Lord Peterborough’s accounts,
which will touch him home, and I am glad of it, for he is the most
troublesome impertinent man that ever I met with. Thence to the ‘Change,
and there, after some business, home to dinner, where Luellin and Mount
came to me and dined, and after dinner my wife and I by coach to see my
Lady Sandwich, where we find all the children and my Lord removed, and
the house so melancholy that I thought my Lady had been dead, knowing
that she was not well; but it seems she hath the meazles, and I fear the
small pox, poor lady. It grieves me mightily; for it will be a sad
houre to the family should she miscarry. Thence straight home and to the
office, and in the evening comes Mr. Hill the merchant and another with
him that sings well, and we sung some things, and good musique it seemed
to me, only my mind too full of business to have much pleasure in it.
But I will have more of it. They gone, and I having paid Mr. Moxon for
the work he has done for the office upon the King’s globes, I to my
office, where very late busy upon Captain Tayler’s bills for his masts,
which I think will never off my hand. Home to supper and to bed.
