17th (Lord’s day). At church in the morning, a stranger preached a good
honest and painfull sermon. My wife and I dined upon a chine of beef at
Sir W. Batten’s, so to church again. Then home, and put some papers in
order. Then to supper at Sir W. Batten’s again, where my wife by chance
fell down and hurt her knees exceedingly. So home and to bed.
