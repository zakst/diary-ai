24th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and all the morning in my chamber setting some
of my private papers in order, for I perceive that now publique business
takes up so much of my time that I must get time a-Sundays or a-nights
to look after my owne matters. Dined and spent all the afternoon talking
with my wife, at night a little to the office, and so home to supper and
to bed.
