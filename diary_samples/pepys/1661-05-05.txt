5s. and the maid of the house 2s. But for as much I expected to give the
name to the child, but did not (it being called John), I forbore then
to give my plate till another time after a little more advice. All being
done, we went to Mrs. Shipman’s, who is a great butter-woman, and I did
see there the most of milk and cream, and the cleanest that ever I saw
in my life. After we had filled our bellies with cream, we took our
leaves and away. In our way, we had great sport to try who should drive
fastest, Sir W. Batten’s coach, or Sir W. Pen’s chariott, they having
four, and we two horses, and we beat them. But it cost me the spoiling
of my clothes and velvet coat with dirt. Being come home I to bed, and
give my breeches to be dried by the fire against to-morrow.
