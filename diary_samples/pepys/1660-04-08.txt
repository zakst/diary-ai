8th (Lord’s day). Very calm again, and I pretty well, but my head aked
all day. About noon set sail; in our way I see many vessels and masts,
which are now the greatest guides for ships. We had a brave wind all the
afternoon, and overtook two good merchantmen that overtook us yesterday,
going to the East Indies. The lieutenant and I lay out of his window
with his glass, looking at the women that were on board them, being
pretty handsome. This evening Major Willoughby, who had been here three
or four days on board with Mr. Pickering, went on board a catch [ketch]
for Dunkirk. We continued sailing when I went to bed, being somewhat
ill again, and Will Howe, the surgeon, parson, and Balty supped in the
Lieutenant’s cabin and afterwards sat disputing, the parson for and I
against extemporary prayers, very hot.
