25th (Lady day). This morning came workmen to begin the making of me a
new pair of stairs up out of my parler, which, with other work that I
have to do, I doubt will keep me this two months and so long I shall
be all in dirt; but the work do please me very well. To the office,
and there all the morning, dined at home, and after dinner comes Mr.
Salisbury to see me, and shewed me a face or two of his paynting,
and indeed I perceive that he will be a great master. I took him to
Whitehall with me by water, but he would not by any means be moved to go
through bridge, and so we were fain to go round by the Old Swan. To my
Lord’s and there I shewed him the King’s picture, which he intends to
copy out in little. After that I and Captain Ferrers to Salisbury Court
by water, and saw part of the “Queene’s Maske.” Then I to Mrs. Turner,
and there staid talking late. The. Turner being in a great chafe, about
being disappointed of a room to stand in at the Coronacion. Then to my
father’s, and there staid talking with my mother and him late about my
dinner to-morrow. So homewards and took up a boy that had a lanthorn,
that was picking up of rags, and got him to light me home, and had great
discourse with him how he could get sometimes three or four bushells
of rags in a day, and got 3d. a bushell for them, and many other
discourses, what and how many ways there are for poor children to get
their livings honestly. So home and I to bed at 12 o’clock at night,
being pleased well with the work that my workmen have begun to-day.
