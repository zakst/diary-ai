18th. Up, and to my office about my great business betimes, and so to
the office, where all the morning. At noon dined, and then to the office
all the afternoon also, and in the evening to Sir W. Coventryâ€™s, but he
not within, I took coach alone to the Park, to try to meet him there,
but did not; but there were few coaches, but among the few there were
in two coaches our two great beauties, my Lady Castlemayne and Richmond;
the first time I saw the latter since she had the smallpox. I had much
pleasure to see them, but I thought they were strange one to another.
Thence going out I met a coach going, which I thought had Knepp in it,
so I went back, but it was not she. So back to White Hall and there took
water, and so home, and busy late about my great letter to the Duke of
York, and so to supper and to bed....
