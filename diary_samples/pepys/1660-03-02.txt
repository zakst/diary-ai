2d. This morning I went early to my Lord at Mr. Crew’s, where I spoke to
him. Here were a great many come to see him, as Secretary Thurlow who is
now by this Parliament chosen again Secretary of State. There were also
General Monk’s trumpeters to give my Lord a sound of their trumpets this
morning. Thence I went to my office, and wrote a letter to Mr. Downing
about the business of his house. Then going home, I met with Mr. Eglin,
Chetwind, and Thomas, who took me to the Leg [another tavern] in King’s
street, where we had two brave dishes of meat, one of fish, a carp and
some other fishes, as well done as ever I ate any. After that to the
Swan tavern, where we drank a quart or two of wine, and so parted. So
I to Mrs. Jem and took Mr. Moore with me (who I met in the street), and
there I met W. Howe and Sheply. After that to Westminster Hall, where
I saw Sir G. Booth at liberty. This day I hear the City militia is put
into good posture, and it is thought that Monk will not be able to do
any great matter against them now, if he have a mind. I understand that
my Lord Lambert did yesterday send a letter to the Council, and that
to-night he is to come and appear to the Council in person. Sir Arthur
Haselrigge do not yet appear in the House. Great is the talk of a
single person, and that it would now be Charles, George, or Richard
again.--[Charles II., or George Monk, or Richard Cromwell.]--For the
last of which, my Lord St. John is said to speak high. Great also is the
dispute now in the House, in whose name the writs shall run for the next
Parliament; and it is said that Mr. Prin, in open House, said, “In King
Charles’s.” From Westminster Hall home. Spent the evening in my study,
and so after some talk with my wife, then to bed.
