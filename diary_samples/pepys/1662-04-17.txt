17th. At my office all the morning, and at noon to the Exchange, where
meeting Mr. Moore and Mr. Stucky, of the Wardrobe, we to an ordinary
to dinner, and after dinner Mr. Moore and I about 3 o’clock to Paul’s
school, to wait upon Mr. Crumlum (Mr. Moore having a hopeful lad, a
kinsman of his, there at school), who we take very luckily, and went up
to his chamber with him, where there was also an old fellow student of
Mr. Crumlum’s, one Mr. Newell, come to see him, of whom he made so much,
and of me, that the truth is he with kindness did drink more than I
believe he used to do, and did begin to be a little impertinent, the
more when after all he would in the evening go forth with us and give us
a bottle of wine abroad, and at the tavern met with an acquaintance of
his that did occasion impertinent discourse, that though I honour the
man, and he do declare abundance of learning and worth, yet I confess
my opinion is much lessened of him, and therefore let it be a caution
to myself not to love drink, since it has such an effect upon others of
greater worth in my own esteem. I could not avoid drinking of 5 glasses
this afternoon with him, and after I had parted with him Mr. Moore and I
to my house, and after we had eaten something to my lodgings, where the
master of the house, a very ordinary fellow, was ready to entertain
me and took me into his dining-room where his wife was, a pretty and
notable lady, too fine surely for him, and too much wit too. Here I was
forced to stay with them a good while and did drink again, there being
friends of theirs with them. At last being weary of his idle company,
I bid good-night and so to my chamber and Mr. [Moore] and I to bed,
neither of us well pleased with our afternoon’s work, merely from our
being witnesses of Mr. Crumlum’s weakness. This day my boy is come from
Brampton, and my wife I think the next week.
