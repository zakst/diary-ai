9th. Up, and at the office all the morning, and at noon, my Lord
Brouncker, Mr. Wren, Joseph Williamson, and Captain Cocke, dined with
me; and, being newly sat down, comes in, by invitation of Williamson’s,
the Lieutenant of the Tower, and he brings in with him young Mr. Whore,
whose father, of the Tower, I know.--And here I had a neat dinner,
and all in so good manner and fashion, and with so good company, and
everything to my mind, as I never had more in my life--the company being
to my heart’s content, and they all well pleased. So continued, looking
over my books and closet till the evening, and so I to the Office and
did a good deal of business, and so home to supper and to bed with my
mind mightily pleased with this day’s management, as one of the days of
my life of fullest content.
