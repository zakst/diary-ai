14th. She begun to talk in the morning and to be friends, believing
all this while that. I had read her letter, which I perceive by her
discourse was full of good counsel, and relating the reason of her
desiring a woman, and how little charge she did intend it to be to me,
so I begun and argued it as full and plain to her, and she to reason
it highly to me, to put her away, and take one of the Bowyers if I did
dislike her, that I did resolve when the house is ready she shall try
her for a while; the truth is, I having a mind to have her come for her
musique and dancing. So up and about my papers all the morning, and her
brother coming I did tell him my mind plain, who did assure me that they
were both of the sisters very humble and very poor, and that she that
we are to have would carry herself so. So I was well contented and spent
part of the morning at my office, and so home and to dinner, and after
dinner, finding Sarah to be discontented at the news of this woman, I
did begin in my wife’s chamber to talk to her and tell her that it was
not out of unkindness to her, but my wife came up, and I perceive she
is not too reconciled to her whatever the matter is, that I perceive I
shall not be able to keep her, though she is as good a servant (only a
little pettish) that ever I desire to have, and a creditable servant. So
she desired leave to go out to look [for] a service, and did, for which
I am troubled, and fell out highly afterwards with my wife about it. So
to my office, where we met this afternoon about answering a great letter
of my Lord Treasurer’s, and that done to my office drawing up a letter
to him, and so home to supper.
