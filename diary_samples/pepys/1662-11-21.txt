21St. Within all day long, helping to put up my hangings in my house in
my wife’s chamber, to my great content. In the afternoon I went to speak
to Sir J. Minnes at his lodgings, where I found many great ladies, and
his lodgings made very fine indeed. At night to supper and to bed:
this night having first put up a spitting sheet, which I find very
convenient. This day come the King’s pleasure-boats from Calais, with
the Dunkirk money, being 400,000 pistolles.
