me most nobly, as my wife says. At the office all day. At noon, put on
my first laced band, all lace; and to Kate Joyce’s to dinner, where my
mother, wife, and abundance of their friends, and good usage. Thence,
wife and Mercer and I to the Old Exchange, and there bought two lace
bands more, one of my semstresse, whom my wife concurs with me to be
a pretty woman. So down to Deptford and Woolwich, my boy and I. At
Woolwich, discoursed with Mr. Sheldon about my bringing my wife down for
a month or two to his house, which he approves of, and, I think, will be
very convenient. So late back, and to the office, wrote letters, and
so home to supper and to bed. This day the Newes book upon Mr. Moore’s
