24th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon home
to dinner, Mr. Sheres dining with us by agreement; and my wife, which
troubled me, mighty careful to have a handsome dinner for him; but yet
I see no reason to be troubled at it, he being a very civil and worthy
man, I think; but only it do seem to imply some little neglect of me.
After dinner to the King’s house, and there saw “The General” revived--a
good play, that pleases me well, and thence, our coach coming for us, we
parted and home, and I busy late at the office, and then home to supper
and to bed. Well pleased to-night to have Lead, the vizard-maker, bring
me home my vizard, with a tube fastened in it, which, I think, will do
my business, at least in a great measure, for the easing of my eyes.
