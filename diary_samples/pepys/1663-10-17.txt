17th. Up and to my office, and there we sat a very full board all the
morning upon some accounts of Mr. Gauden’s. Here happened something
concerning my Will which Sir W. Batten would fain charge upon him, and
I heard him mutter something against him of complaint for his often
receiving people’s money to Sir G. Carteret, which displeased me much,
but I will be even with him. Thence to the Dolphin Tavern, and there
Mr. Gauden did give us a great dinner. Here we had some discourse of the
Queen’s being very sick, if not dead, the Duke and Duchess of York being
sent for betimes this morning to come to White Hall to her. So to my
office and there late doing business, and so home to supper, my house
being got mighty clean to my great content from top to toe, and so to
bed, myself beginning to be in good condition of health also, but only
my laying out so much money upon clothes for myself and wife and her
closet troubles me.
