9th. Up and to my office, and so to dinner at home, and then to several
places to pay my debts, and then to Westminster to Dr. Castle, who
discoursed with me about Privy Seal business, which I do not much mind,
it being little worth, but by Watkins’s--[clerk of the Privy Seal]--late
sudden death we are like to lose money. Thence to Mr. de Cretz, and
there saw some good pieces that he hath copyed of the King’s pieces,
some of Raphael and Michael Angelo; and I have borrowed an Elizabeth
of his copying to hang up in my house, and sent it home by Will. Thence
with Mr. Salisbury, who I met there, into Covent Garden to an alehouse,
to see a picture that hangs there, which is offered for 20s., and I
offered fourteen--but it is worth much more money--but did not buy it,
I having no mind to break my oath. Thence to see an Italian puppet play
that is within the rayles there, which is very pretty, the best that
ever I saw, and great resort of gallants. So to the Temple and by water
home, and so walk upon the leads, and in the dark there played upon my
flageolette, it being a fine still evening, and so to supper and to bed.
This day I paid Godfrey’s debt of 40 and odd pounds. The Duke of York
went last night to Portsmouth; so that I believe the Queen is near.
