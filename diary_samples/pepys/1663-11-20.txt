20th. Up, and as soon as I could to my Lord Sandwich’s lodgings, but
he was gone out before, and so I am defeated of my expectation of being
eased one way or other in the business of my Lord. But I went up to Mr.
Howe, who I saw this day the first time in a periwigg, which becomes
him very well, and discoursed with him. He tells me that my Lord is of
a sudden much changed, and he do believe that he do take my letter well.
However, we do both bless God that it hath so good an effect upon him.
Thence I home again, calling at the Wardrobe, where I found my Lord, but
so busy with Mr. Townsend making up accounts there that I was unwilling
to trouble him, and so went away. By and by to the Exchange, and there
met by agreement Mr. Howe, and took him with a barrel of oysters home to
dinner, where we were very merry, and indeed I observe him to be a very
hopeful young man, but only a little conceited. After dinner I took him
and my wife, and setting her in Covent Garden at her mother’s, he and I
to my Lord’s, and thence I with Mr. Moore to White Hall, there the King
and Council being close, and I thinking it an improper place to meet
my Lord first upon the business; I took coach, and calling my wife went
home, setting Mr. Moore down by the way, and having been late at the
office alone looking over some plates of the Northern seas, the White
seas, and Archangell river, I went home, and, after supper, to bed.
My wife tells me that she and her brother have had a great falling out
to-night, he taking upon him to challenge great obligation upon her, and
taxing her for not being so as she ought to be to her friends, and that
she can do more with me than she pretends, and I know not what, but God
be thanked she cannot. A great talke there is today of a crush between
some of the Fanatiques up in arms, and the King’s men in the North; but
whether true I know not yet.
