28th. Up, and this day put on a half shirt first this summer, it being
very hot; and yet so ill-tempered I am grown, that I am afeard I shall
catch cold, while all the world is ready to melt away. To the office
all the morning, at noon to dinner at home, then to my office till the
evening, then out about several businesses and then by appointment to
the â€˜Change, and thence with my uncle Wight to the Mum house, and there
drinking, he do complain of his wife most cruel as the most troublesome
woman in the world, and how she will have her will, saying she brought
him a portion and God knows what. By which, with many instances more, I
perceive they do live a sad life together. Thence to the Mitre and there
comes Dr. Burnett to us and Mr. Maes, but the meeting was chiefly to
bring the Doctor and me together, and there I began to have his advice
about my disease, and then invited him to my house: and I am resolved
to put myself into his hands. Here very late, but I drank nothing, nor
will, though he do advise me to take care of cold drinks. So home and to
bed.
