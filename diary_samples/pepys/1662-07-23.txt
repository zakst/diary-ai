23rd. This morning angry a little in the morning, and my house being so
much out of order makes me a little pettish. I went to the office, and
there dispatched business by myself, and so again in the afternoon;
being a little vexed that my brother Tom, by his neglect, do fail to
get a coach for my wife and maid this week, by which she will not be at
Brampton Feast, to meet my Lady at my father’s. At night home, and late
packing up things in order to their going to Brampton to-morrow, and so
to bed, quite out of sorts in my mind by reason that the weather is so
bad, and my house all full of wet, and the trouble of going from one
house to another to Sir W. Pen’s upon every occasion. Besides much
disturbed by reason of the talk up and down the town, that my Lord
Sandwich is lost; but I trust in God the contrary.
