2nd. Up early about business and then to the Wardrobe with Mr. Moore,
and spoke to my Lord about the exchange of the crusados

     [Cruzado, a Portuguese coin of 480 reis.  It is named from a cross
     which it bears on one side, the arms of Portugal being on the other.
     It varied in value at different periods from 2s. 3d. to 4s.]

into sterling money, and other matters. So to my father at Tom’s, and
after some talk with him away home, and by and by comes my father to
dinner with me, and then by coach, setting him down in Cheapside, my
wife and I to Mrs. Clarke’s at Westminster, the first visit that ever
we both made her yet. We found her in a dishabille, intending to go to
Hampton Court to-morrow. We had much pretty discourse, and a very fine
lady she is. Thence by water to Salisbury Court, and Mrs. Turner not
being at home, home by coach, and so after walking on the leads and
supper to bed. This day my wife put on her slasht wastecoate, which is
very pretty.
