31st. All the morning, after musique practice, in my cellar, ordering
some alteracons therein, being much pleased with my new door into the
back yard. So to dinner, and all the afternoon thinking upon business.
I did by night set many things in order, which pleased me well, and puts
me upon a resolution of keeping within doors and minding my business and
the business of the office, which I pray God I may put in practice. At
night to bed.
