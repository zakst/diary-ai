14th. Up, and by water to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, where,
among other things, a silly account of a falling out between Norwood,
at Tangier, and Mr. Bland, the mayor, who is fled to Cales [Cadiz]. His
complaint is ill-worded, and the other’s defence the most ridiculous
that ever I saw; and so everybody else that was there, thought it;
but never did I see so great an instance of the use of grammar, and
knowledge how to tell a man’s tale as this day, Bland having spoiled his
business by ill-telling it, who had work to have made himself notorious
by his mastering Norwood, his enemy, if he had known how to have used
it. Thence calling Smith, the Auditor’s clerk at the Temple, I by the
Exchange home, and there looked over my Tangier accounts with him, and
so to dinner, and then set him down again by a hackney, my coachman
being this day about breaking of my horses to the coach, they having
never yet drawn. Left my wife at Unthank’s, and I to the Treasury, where
we waited on the Lords Commissioners about Sir D. Gawden’s matters, and
so took her up again at night, and home to the office, and so home with
W. Hewer, and to talk about our quarrel with Middleton, and so to supper
and to bed. This day I hear, and am glad, that the King hath prorogued
the Parliament to October next; and, among other reasons, it will give
me time to go to France, I hope.
