18th. Up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon to the
‘Change, and took Mr. Hill along with me to Mr. Povy’s, where we dined,
and shewed him the house to his good content, and I expect when we meet
we shall laugh at it. But I having business to stay, he went away, and
Povy and Creed and I to do some business upon Povy’s accounts all the
afternoon till late at night, where, God help him! never man was so
confounded, and all his people about him in this world as he and his
are. After we had done something [to the] purpose we broke up, and
Povy acquainted me before Creed (having said something of it also this
morning at our office to me) what he had done in speaking to the Duke
and others about his making me Treasurer, and has carried it a great
way, so as I think it cannot well be set back. Creed, I perceive, envies
me in it, but I think as that will do me no hurte, so if it did I am at
a great losse to think whether it were not best for me to let it wholly
alone, for it will much disquiett me and my business of the Navy, which
in this warr will certainly be worth all my time to me. Home, continuing
in this doubtfull condition what to think of it, but God Almighty do
his will in it for the best. To my office, where late, and then home to
supper and to bed.
