7 or L800 at most. Being wearied with looking upon a company of ugly
women, Creed and I went away, and took coach and through Cheapside, and
there saw the pageants, which were very silly, and thence to the Temple,
where meeting Greatorex, he and we to Hercules Pillars, there to show me
the manner of his going about of draining of fenns, which I desired much
to know, but it did not appear very satisfactory to me, as he discoursed
it, and I doubt he will faile in it. Thence I by coach home, and there
found my wife come home, and by and by came my brother Tom, with whom
I was very angry for not sending me a bill with my things, so as that I
think never to have more work done by him if ever he serves me so again,
and so I told him. The consideration of laying out L32 12s. this very
month in his very work troubles me also, and one thing more, that is to
say, that Will having been at home all the day, I doubt is the occasion
that Jane has spoken to her mistress tonight that she sees she cannot
please us and will look out to provide herself elsewhere, which do
trouble both of us, and we wonder also at her, but yet when the rogue is
gone I do not fear but the wench will do well. To the office a little,
to set down my Journall, and so home late to supper and to bed. The
Queen mends apace, they say; but yet talks idle still.
