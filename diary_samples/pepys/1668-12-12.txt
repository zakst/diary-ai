12th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon home
to dinner, and so the like mighty busy, late, all the afternoon, that
I might be ready to go to the drawing up of my answer to Middleton
to-morrow, and therefore home to supper and to bed. I hear this day that
there is fallen down a new house, not quite finished, in Lumbard Street,
and that there have been several so, they making use of bad mortar and
bricks; but no hurt yet, as God hath ordered it. This day was brought
home my pair of black coach-horses, the first I ever was master of. They
cost me L50, and are a fine pair.
