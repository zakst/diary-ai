10th. Up, and to the office. At noon, full of business, to dinner. This
day comes first Sir Thomas Harvy after the plague, having been out of
towne all this while. He was coldly received by us, and he went away
before we rose also, to make himself appear yet a man less necessary.
After dinner, being full of care and multitude of business, I took coach
and my wife with me. I set her down at her mother’s (having first called
at my Lord Treasurer’s and there spoke with Sir Ph. Warwicke), and I to
the Exchequer about Tangier orders, and so to the Swan and there staid a
little, and so by coach took up my wife, and at the old Exchange bought
a muffe, and so home and late at my letters, and so to supper and to
bed, being now-a-days, for these four or five months, mightily troubled
with my snoring in my sleep, and know not how to remedy it.
