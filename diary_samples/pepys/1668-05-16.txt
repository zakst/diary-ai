16th. Up; and to the Office, where we sat all the morning; and at
noon, home with my people to dinner; and thence to the Office all the
afternoon, till, my eyes weary, I did go forth by coach to the King’s
playhouse, and there saw the best part of “The Sea Voyage,” where Knepp
I see do her part of sorrow very well. I afterwards to her house; but
she did not come presently home; and there je did kiss her ancilla,
which is so mighty belle; and I to my tailor’s, and to buy me a belt for
my new suit against to-morrow; and so home, and there to my Office, and
afterwards late walking in the garden; and so home to supper, and to
bed, after Nell’s cutting of my hair close, the weather being very hot.
