6th (Lord’s day). Up, and dressed myself, and so walked out with the boy
to Smithfield to Cow Lane, to Lincolne’s, and there spoke with him, and
agreed upon the hour to-morrow, to set out towards Brampton; but vexed
that he is not likely to go himself, but sends another for him. Here I
took a hackney coach, and to White Hall, and there met Sir W. Coventry,
and discoursed with him, and then with my Lord Bruncker, and many
others, to end my matters in order to my going into the country
to-morrow for five or six days, which I have not done for above three
years. Walked with Creed into the Park a little, and at last went into
the Queen’s side, and there saw the King and Queen, and saw the ladies,
in order to my hearing any news stirring to carry into the country, but
met with none, and so away home by coach, and there dined, and W. How
come to see me, and after dinner parted, and I to my writing to my Lord
Sandwich, which is the greatest business I have to do before my going
into the country, and in the evening to my office to set matters to
rights there, and being in the garden Sir W. Pen did come to me, and
fell to discourse about the business of “The Flying Greyhound,” wherein
I was plain to him and he to me, and at last concluded upon my writing
a petition to the Duke of York for a certain ship, The Maybolt Gallyott,
and he offers to give me L300 for my success, which, however, I would
not oblige him to, but will see the issue of it by fair play, and so
I did presently draw a petition, which he undertakes to proffer to the
Duke of York, and solicit for me, and will not seem to doubt of his
success. So I wrote, and did give it him, and left it with him, and so
home to supper, where Pelling comes and sits with me, and there tells us
how old Mr. Batelier is dead this last night in the night, going to
bed well, which I am mightily troubled for, he being a good man. Supper
done, and he gone, I to my chamber to write my journal to this night,
and so to bed.
