27th. Up, but weary, and to the office, where we sat all the morning.
Before I went to the office there came Bagwell’s wife to me to speak for
her husband. I liked the woman very well and stroked her under the chin,
but could not find in my heart to offer anything uncivil to her, she
being, I believe, a very modest woman. At noon with Mr. Coventry to the
African house, and to my Lord Peterborough’s business again, and then to
dinner, where, before dinner, we had the best oysters I have seen this
year, and I think as good in all respects as ever I eat in my life. I
eat a great many. Great, good company at dinner, among others Sir Martin
Noell, who told us the dispute between him, as farmer of the Additional
Duty, and the East India Company, whether callicos be linnen or no;
which he says it is, having been ever esteemed so: they say it is made
of cotton woole, and grows upon trees, not like flax or hempe. But
it was carried against the Company, though they stand out against the
verdict. Thence home and to the office, where late, and so home to
supper and to bed, and had a very pleasing and condescending answer from
my poor father to-day in answer to my angry discontentful letter to him
the other day, which pleases me mightily.
