17th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon home
to my poor wife and dined, and then by coach abroad to Mrs. Turner’s
where I have not been for many a day, and there I found her and her
sister Dike very sad for the death of their brother. After a little
common expression of sorrow, Mrs. Turner told me that the trouble she
would put me to was, to consult about getting an achievement prepared,
scutcheons were done already, to set over the door. So I did go out to
Mr. Smith’s, where my brother tells me the scutcheons are made, but he
not being within, I went to the Temple, and there spent my time in a
Bookseller’s shop, reading in a book of some Embassages into Moscovia,
&c., where was very good reading, and then to Mrs. Turner’s, and thither
came Smith to me, with whom I did agree for L4 to make a handsome one,
ell square within the frame. After he was gone I sat an houre talking of
the suddennesse of his death within 7 days, and how by little and little
death came upon him, neither he nor they thinking it would come to that.
He died after a day’s raveing, through lightness in his head for want of
sleep. His lady did not know of his sickness, nor do they hear yet
how she takes it. Hence home, taking some books by the way in Paul’s
Churchyard by coach to my office, where late doing business, and so home
to supper and to bed.
