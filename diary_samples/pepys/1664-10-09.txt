9th (Lord’s day). Lay pretty long, but however up time enough with my
wife to go to church. Then home to dinner, and Mr. Fuller, my Cambridge
acquaintance, coming to me about what he was with me lately, to release
a waterman, he told me he was to preach at Barking Church; and so I
to heare him, and he preached well and neatly. Thence, it being time
enough, to our owne church, and there staid wholly privately at the
great doore to gaze upon a pretty lady, and from church dogged her home,
whither she went to a house near Tower hill, and I think her to be one
of the prettiest women I ever saw. So home, and at my office a while
busy, then to my uncle Wight’s, whither it seems my wife went after
sermon and there supped, but my aunt and uncle in a very ill humour one
with another, but I made shift with much ado to keep them from scolding,
and so after supper home and to bed without prayers, it being cold, and
to-morrow washing day.
