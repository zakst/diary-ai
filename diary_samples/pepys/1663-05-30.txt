30th. Up betimes, and Creed and I by water to Fleet Street, and my
brother not being ready, he and I walked to the New Exchange, and there
drank our morning draught of whay, the first I have done this year; but
I perceive the lawyers come all in as they go to the Hall, and I believe
it is very good. So to my brother’s, and there I found my aunt James,
a poor, religious, well-meaning, good soul, talking of nothing but God
Almighty, and that with so much innocence that mightily pleased me. Here
was a fellow that said grace so long like a prayer; I believe the fellow
is a cunning fellow, and yet I by my brother’s desire did give him
a crown, he being in great want, and, it seems, a parson among the
fanatiques, and a cozen of my poor aunt’s, whose prayers she told me
did do me good among the many good souls that did by my father’s desires
pray for me when I was cut of the stone, and which God did hear, which
I also in complaisance did own; but, God forgive me, my mind was
otherwise. I had a couple of lobsters and some wine for her, and so, she
going out of town to-day, and being not willing to come home with me to
dinner, I parted and home, where we sat at the office all the morning,
and after dinner all the afternoon till night, there at my office
getting up the time that I have of late lost by not following my
business, but I hope now to settle my mind again very well to my
business. So home, and after supper did wash my feet, and so to bed.
