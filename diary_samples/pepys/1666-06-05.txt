5th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, expecting every houre
more newes of the fleete and the issue of yesterday’s fight, but
nothing come. At noon, though I should have dined with my Lord Mayor and
Aldermen at an entertainment of Commissioner Taylor’s, yet it being a
time of expectation of the successe of the fleete, I did not go, but
dined at home, and after dinner by water down to Deptford (and Woolwich,
where I had not been since I lodged there, and methinks the place has
grown natural to me), and thence down to Longreach, calling on all the
ships in the way, seeing their condition for sayling, and what they
want. Home about 11 of the clock, and so eat a bit and to bed, having
received no manner of newes this day, but of The Rainbow’s being put in
from the fleete, maimed as the other ships are, and some say that Sir W.
Clerke is dead of his leg being cut off.
