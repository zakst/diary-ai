16th. Up, and with Mr. Andrews to White Hall, where a Committee of
Tangier, and there I did our victuallers’ business for some more money,
out of which I hope to get a little, of which I was glad; but, Lord!
to see to what a degree of contempt, nay, scorn, Mr. Povy, through his
prodigious folly, hath brought himself in his accounts, that if he be
not a man of a great interest, he will be kicked out of his employment
for a foole, is very strange, and that most deservedly that ever man
was, for never any man, that understands accounts so little, ever went
through so much, and yet goes through it with the greatest shame and
yet with confidence that ever I saw man in my life. God deliver me in my
owne business of my bill out of his hands, and if ever I foul my fingers
with him again let me suffer for it! Back to the ‘Change, and thence
home to dinner, where Mrs. Hunt dined with me, and poor Mrs. Batters;
who brought her little daughter with her, and a letter from her husband,
wherein, as a token, the foole presents me very seriously with his
daughter for me to take the charge of bringing up for him, and to make
my owne. But I took no notice to her at all of the substance of the
letter, but fell to discourse, and so went away to the office, where all
the afternoon till almost one in the morning, and then home to bed.
