18th. Up, and after some pleasant discourse with my wife (though my
head full of business) I out and left her to go home, and myself to
the office, and thence by water to the Duke of Albemarleâ€™s, and so back
again and find my wife gone. So to my chamber at my lodgings, and to the
making of my accounts up of Tangier, which I did with great difficulty,
finding the difference between short and long reckonings where I
have had occasion to mix my moneys, as I have of late done my Tangier
treasure upon other occasions, and other moneys upon that. However,
I was at it late and did it pretty perfectly, and so, after eating
something, to bed, my mind eased of a great deal of figures and
castings.
