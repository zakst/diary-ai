7th. Up, and to coach, and with a guide to Petersfield, where I find
Sir Thomas Allen and Mr. Tippets come; the first about the business, the
latter only in respect to me; as also Fitzgerald, who come post all
last night, and newly arrived here. We four sat down presently to our
business, and in an hour despatched all our talk; and did inform Sir
Thomas Allen well in it, who, I perceive, in serious matters, is a
serious man: and tells me he wishes all we are told be true, in our
defence; for he finds by all, that the Turks have, to this day, been
very civil to our merchant-men everywhere; and, if they would have broke
with us, they never had such an opportunity over our rich merchant-men,
as lately, coming out of the Streights. Then to dinner, and pretty
merry: and here was Mr. Martin, the purser, and dined with us, and wrote
some things for us. And so took coach again back; Fitzgerald with
us, whom I was pleased with all the day, with his discourse of his
observations abroad, as being a great soldier and of long standing
abroad: and knows all things and persons abroad very well--I mean, the
great soldiers of France, and Spain, and Germany; and talks very well.
Come at night to Gilford, where the Red Lyon so full of people, and a
wedding, that the master of the house did get us a lodging over the
way, at a private house, his landlordâ€™s, mighty neat and fine; and there
supped and talked with the landlord and his wife: and so to bed with
great content, only Fitzgerald lay at the Inne. So to bed.
