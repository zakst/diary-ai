24th. Slept hard till 8 o’clock, then waked by Mr. Clerke’s being come
to consult me about Field’s business, which we did by calling him up
to my bedside, and he says we shall trounce him. Then up, and to
the office, and at 11 o’clock by water to Westminster, and to Sir W.
Wheeler’s about my Lord’s borrowing of money that I was lately upon with
him, and then to my Lord, who continues ill, but will do well I doubt
not. Among other things, he tells me that he hears the Commons will not
agree to the King’s late declaration, nor will yield that the Papists
have any ground given them to raise themselves up again in England,
which I perceive by my Lord was expected at Court. Thence home again
by water presently, and with a bad dinner, being not looked for, to
the office, and there we sat, and then Captn. Cocke and I upon his hemp
accounts till 9 at night, and then, I not very well, home to supper and
to bed. My late distemper of heat and itching being come upon me again,
so that I must think of sweating again as I did before.
