14th. Up, and to the office a while with my Lord Bruncker, where we
directed Sir W. Warren in the business of the insurance as I desired,
and ended some other businesses of his, and so at noon I to London,
but the ‘Change was done before I got thither, so I to the Pope’s Head
Taverne, and there find Mr. Gawden and Captain Beckford and Nick Osborne
going to dinner, and I dined with them and very exceeding merry we were
as I had [not] been a great while, and dinner being done I to the East
India House and there had an assignment on Mr. Temple for the L2,000
of Cocke’s, which joyed my heart; so, having seen my wife in the way, I
home by water and to write my letters and then home to bed.
