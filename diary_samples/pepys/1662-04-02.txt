2nd. Mr. Moore came to me, and he and I walked to the Spittle an hour or
two before my Lord Mayor and the blewcoat boys come, which at last they
did, and a fine sight of charity it is indeed. We got places and staid
to hear a sermon; but, it being a Presbyterian one, it was so long, that
after above an hour of it we went away, and I home and dined; and then
my wife and I by water to the Opera, and there saw “The Bondman” most
excellently acted; and though we had seen it so often, yet I never
liked it better than to-day, Ianthe acting Cleora’s part very well now
Roxalana is gone. We are resolved to see no more plays till Whitsuntide,
we having been three days together. Met Mr. Sanchy, Smithes; Gale, and
Edlin at the play, but having no great mind to spend money, I left them
there. And so home and to supper, and then dispatch business, and so to
bed.
