6th. Up, and by coach to Sir W. Coventryâ€™s, but he gone out. I by water
back to the Office, and there all the morning; then to dinner, and then
to the Office again, and anon with my wife by coach to take the ayre, it
being a noble day, as far as the Greene Man, mightily pleased with our
journey, and our condition of doing it in our own coach, and so home,
and to walk in the garden, and so to supper and to bed, my eyes being
bad with writing my journal, part of it, to-night.
