23rd. At my office all the morning and home to dinner, my head full of
business, and there my wife finds me unexpectedly. But I not being at
leisure to stay or talk with her, she went down by coach to Woolwich,
thinking to fetch Mrs. Barbary to carry her to London to keep her
Christmas with her, and I to the office. This day one come to me with
four great turkies, as a present from Mr. Deane, at Harwich, three of
which my wife carried in the evening home with her to London in her
coach (Mrs. Barbary not being to be got so suddenly, but will come to
her the next week), and I at my office late, and then to my lodgings to
bed.
