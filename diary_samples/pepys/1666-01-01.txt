January 1st (New-Yeare’s Day). Called up by five o’clock, by my order,
by Mr. Tooker, who wrote, while I dictated to him, my business of
the Pursers; and so, without eating or drinking, till three in the
afternoon, and then, to my great content, finished it. So to dinner,
Gibson and he and I, and then to copying it over, Mr. Gibson reading and
I writing, and went a good way in it till interrupted by Sir W. Warren’s
coming, of whom I always learne something or other, his discourse being
very good and his brains also. He being gone we to our business again,
and wrote more of it fair, and then late to bed.
