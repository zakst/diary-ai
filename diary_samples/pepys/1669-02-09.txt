9th. Up, and all the morning busy at the office, and after dinner
abroad with my wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Island
Princesse,” which I like mighty well, as an excellent play: and here
we find Kinaston to be well enough to act again, which he do very well,
after his beating by Sir Charles Sedley’s appointment; and so thence
home, and there to my business at the Office, and after my letters
done, then home to supper and to bed, my mind being mightily eased by my
having this morning delivered to the Office a letter of advice about our
answers to the Commissioners of Accounts, whom we have neglected, and I
have done this as a record in my justification hereafter, when it shall
come to be examined.
