8th. This morning up early, and to my Lord Chancellor’s with a letter
to him from my Lord, and did speak with him; and he did ask me whether
I was son to Mr. Talbot Pepys or no (with whom he was once acquainted
in the Court of Requests), and spoke to me with great respect. Thence
to Westminster Hall (it being Term time) and there met with Commissioner
Pett, and so at noon he and I by appointment to the Sun in New Fish
Street, where Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, and we all were to dine, at
an invitation of Captain Stoaks and Captain Clerk, and were very merry,
and by discourse I found Sir J. Minnes a fine gentleman and a very good
scholler. After dinner to the Wardrobe, and thence to Dr. Williams, who
went with me (the first time that he has been abroad a great while) to
the Six Clerks Office to find me a clerk there able to advise me in my
business with Tom Trice, and after I had heard them talk, and had given
me some comfort, I went to my brother Tom’s, and took him with me to
my coz. Turner at the Temple, and had his opinion that I should not
pay more than the principal L200, with which I was much pleased, and so
home.
