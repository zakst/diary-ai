6th. At the office all the morning. At dinner Sir W. Batten came
and took me and my wife to his house to dinner, my Lady being in the
country, where we had a good Lenten dinner. Then to Whitehall with
Captn. Cuttle, and there I did some business with Mr. Coventry, and
after that home, thinking to have had Sir W. Batten, &c., to have eat a
wigg--[Wigg, a kind of north country bun or tea-cake, still so called,
to my knowledge, in Staffordshire.--M. B.]--at my house at night. But my
Lady being come home out of the country ill by reason of much rain that
has fallen lately, and the waters being very high, we could not, and so
I home and to bed.
