6th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, and then up and to church alone,
which is the greatest trouble that I have by not having a man or, boy to
wait on me, and so home to dinner, my wife, it being a cold day, and it
begun to snow (the first snow we have seen this year) kept her bed till
after dinner, and I below by myself looking over my arithmetique books
and timber rule. So my wife rose anon, and she and I all the afternoon
at arithmetique, and she is come to do Addition, Subtraction, and
Multiplicacion very well, and so I purpose not to trouble her yet with
Division, but to begin with the Globes to her now. At night came Captain
Grove to discourse with me about Field’s business and of other matters,
and so, he being gone, I to my office, and spent an houre or two reading
Rushworth, and so to supper home, and to prayers and bed, finding
myself by cold to have some pain begin with me, which God defend should
increase.
