30th. This morning, after order given to my workmen, my wife and I and
Mr. Creed took coach, and in Fishstreet took up Mr. Hater and his wife,
who through her mask seemed at first to be an old woman, but afterwards
I found her to be a very pretty modest black woman. We got a small bait
at Leatherhead, and so to Godlyman, where we lay all night, and were
very merry, having this day no other extraordinary rencontre, but my
hat falling off my head at Newington into the water, by which it was
spoiled, and I ashamed of it. I am sorry that I am not at London, to be
at Hide-parke to-morrow, among the great gallants and ladies, which will
be very fine.
