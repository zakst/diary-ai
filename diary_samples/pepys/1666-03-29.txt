29th. Up, called up with newes from Sir W. Batten that Hogg hath brought
in two prizes more: and so I thither, and hear the particulars, which
are good; one of them, if prize, being worth L4,000: for which God be
thanked! Then to the office, and have the newes brought us of Captain
Robinson’s coming with his fleete from Gottenburgh: dispersed, though,
by foul weather. But he hath light of five Dutch men-of-war, and taken
three, whereof one is sunk; which is very good newes to close up the
year with, and most of our merchantmen already heard of to be safely
come home, though after long lookings-for, and now to several ports,
as they could make them. At noon home to dinner, where Balty is and
now well recovered. Then to the office to do business, and at night, it
being very cold, home to my chamber, and there late writing, but my
left eye still very sore. I write by spectacles all this night, then to
supper and to bed. This day’s good news making me very lively, only the
arrears of much business on my hands and my accounts to be settled for
the whole year past do lie as a weight on my mind.
