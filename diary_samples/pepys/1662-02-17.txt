17th. This morning, both Sir Williams, myself, and Captain Cocke and
Captain Tinker of the Convertine, which we are going to look upon (being
intended to go with these ships fitting for the East Indys), down to
Deptford; and thence, after being on shipboard, to Woolwich, and there
eat something. The Sir Williams being unwilling to eat flesh,

     [In Lent, of which the observance, intermitted for nineteen years,
     was now reviving.  We have seen that Pepys, as yet, had not cast off
     all show of Puritanism.  “In this month the Fishmongers’ Company
     petitioned the King that Lent might be kept, because they had
     provided abundance of fish for this season, and their prayer was
     granted.”--Rugge.--B.]

Captain Cocke and I had a breast of veal roasted. And here I drank wine
upon necessity, being ill for want of it, and I find reason to fear that
by my too sudden leaving off wine, I do contract many evils upon myself.
Going and coming we played at gleeke, and I won 9s. 6d. clear, the
most that ever I won in my life. I pray God it may not tempt me to play
again. Being come home again we went to the Dolphin, where Mr. Alcock
and my Lady and Mrs. Martha Batten came to us, and after them many
others (as it always is where Sir W. Batten goes), and there we had some
pullets to supper. I eat though I was not very well, and after that left
them, and so home and to bed.
