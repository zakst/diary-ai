7th (Lord’s day). A great snow, and so to church this morning with my
wife, which is the first time she hath been at church since her going to
Brampton, and Gosnell attending her, which was very gracefull. So home,
and we dined above in our dining room, the first time since it was new
done, and in the afternoon I thought to go to the French church; but
finding the Dutch congregation there, and then finding the French
congregation’s sermon begun in the Dutch, I returned home, and up to our
gallery, where I found my wife and Gosnell, and after a drowsy sermon,
we all three to my aunt Wight’s, where great store of her usuall
company, and here we staid a pretty while talking, I differing from my
aunt, as I commonly do, in our opinion of the handsomeness of the Queen,
which I oppose mightily, saying that if my nose be handsome, then is
her’s, and such like. After much discourse, seeing the room full, and
being unwilling to stay all three, I took leave, and so with my wife
only to see Sir W. Pen, who is now got out of his bed, and sits by the
fireside. And after some talk, home and to supper, and after prayers
to bed. This night came in my wife’s brother and talked to my wife and
Gosnell about his wife, which they told me afterwards of, and I do smell
that he I doubt is overreached in thinking that he has got a rich wife,’
and I fear she will prove otherwise. So to bed.
