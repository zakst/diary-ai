25th. Up and to the office all the morning, and at noon with the rest,
by Mr. Holy, the ironmonger’s invitation, to the Dolphin, to a venison
pasty, very good, and rare at this time of the year, and thence by coach
with Mr. Coventry as far as the Temple, and thence to Greatorex’s, where
I staid and talked with him, and got him to mend my pocket ruler for
me, and so by coach to my Lord’s lodging, where I sat with Mr. Moore by
appointment, making up accounts for my Lord Sandwich, which done he and
I and Capt. Ferrers and W. Howe very merry a good while in the great
dining room, and so it being late and my Lord not coming in, I by coach
to the Temple, and thence walked home, and so to my study to do some
business, and then home and to bed. Great talk among people how some
of the Fanatiques do say that the end of the world is at hand, and that
next Tuesday is to be the day. Against which, whenever it shall be, good
God fit us all.
