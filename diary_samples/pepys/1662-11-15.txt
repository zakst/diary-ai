15th. All the morning at the office sitting, dined with my wife
pleasantly at home, then among my painters, and by and by went to
my Civil Lawyers about my uncle’s suit, and so home again and saw my
painters make an end of my house this night, which is my great joy, and
so to my office and did business till ten at night, and so home and to
supper, and after reading part of Bussy d’Ambois, a good play I bought
to-day, to bed.
