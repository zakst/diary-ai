25th (Lord’s day). To trimming myself, which I have this week done every
morning, with a pumice stone,--[Shaving with pumice stone.]--which I
learnt of Mr. Marsh, when I was last at Portsmouth; and I find it very
easy, speedy, and cleanly, and shall continue the practice of it. To
church, and heard a good sermon of Mr. Woodcocke’s at our church; only
in his latter prayer for a woman in childbed, he prayed that God would
deliver her from the hereditary curse of child-bearing, which seemed a
pretty strange expression. Dined at home, and Mr. Creed with me. This
day I had the first dish of pease I have had this year. After discourse
he and I abroad, and walked up and down, and looked into many churches,
among others Mr. Baxter’s at Blackfryers. Then to the Wardrobe, where
I found my Lord takes physic, so I did not see him, but with Captn.
Ferrers in Mr. George Montagu’s coach to Charing Cross; and there at the
Triumph tavern he showed me some Portugall ladys, which are come to
town before the Queen. They are not handsome, and their farthingales a
strange dress.

     [Farthingales had gone out of fashion in England during the reign of
     Charles I., and therefore their use by the Portuguese ladies
     astonished the English.  Evelyn also remarks in his Diary on this
     ugly custom (May 30th, 1662).]

Many ladies and persons of quality come to see them. I find nothing
in them that is pleasing; and I see they have learnt to kiss and look
freely up and down already, and I do believe will soon forget the
recluse practice of their own country. They complain much for lack of
good water to drink. So to the Wardrobe back on foot and supped with
my Lady, and so home, and after a walk upon the leads with my wife, to
prayers and bed. The King’s guards and some City companies do walk up
and down the town these five or six days; which makes me think, and they
do say, there are some plots in laying. God keep us.
