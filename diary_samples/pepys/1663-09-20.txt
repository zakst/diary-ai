20th (Lord’s day). Up, and finding my father somewhat better, walked to
Huntingdon church, where in my Lord’s pew, with the young ladies, by
my Lord’s own showing me the place, I stayed the sermon, and so to
Hinchingbroke, walking with Mr. Shepley and Dr. King, whom they account
a witty man here, as well as a good physician, and there my Lord took
me with the rest of the company, and singly demanded my opinion in the
walks in his garden, about the bringing of the crooked wall on the mount
to a shape; and so to dinner, there being Collonel Williams and much
other company, and a noble dinner. But having before got my Lord’s
warrant for travelling to-day, there being a proclamation read yesterday
against it at Huntingdon, at which I am very glad, I took leave, leaving
them at dinner, and walked alone to my father’s, and there, after a
word or two to my father and mother, my wife and I mounted, and, with
my father’s boy, upon a horse I borrowed of Captain Ferrers, we rode to
Bigglesworth by the help of a couple of countrymen, that led us through
the very long and dangerous waters, because of the ditches on each
side, though it begun to be very dark, and there we had a good breast of
mutton roasted for us, and supped, and to bed.
