27th. Up, not without some pain by cold, which makes me mighty
melancholy, to think of the ill state of my health. To the office, where
busy till my brains ready to drop with variety of business, and vexed
for all that to see the service like to suffer by other people’s
neglect. Vexed also at a letter from my father with two troublesome ones
enclosed from Cave and Noble, so that I know not what to do therein. At
home to dinner at noon. But to comfort my heart, Captain Taylor this day
brought me L20 he promised me for my assistance to him about his masts.
After dinner to the office again, and thence with Mr. Wayth to St.
Catherine’s to see some variety of canvas’s, which indeed was worth
my seeing, but only I was in some pain, and so took not the delight I
should otherwise have done. So home to the office, and there busy till
late at night, and so home to supper and to bed. This morning my taylor
brought me a very tall mayde to be my cook-mayde; she asked L5, but my
wife offered her but L3 10s.--whether she will take it or no I know not
till to-morrow, but I am afeard she will be over high for us, she having
last been a chamber mayde, and holds up her head, as my little girle Su
observed.
