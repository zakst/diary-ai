11th. My wife and I up very early this day, and though the weather was
very bad and the wind high, yet my Lady Batten and her maid and we two
did go by our barge to Woolwich (my Lady being very fearfull) where we
found both Sir Williams and much other company, expecting the weather
to be better, that they might go about weighing up the Assurance,
which lies there (poor ship, that I have been twice merry in, in Captn.
Holland’s time,) under water, only the upper deck may be seen and the
masts. Captain Stoakes is very melancholy, and being in search for some
clothes and money of his, which he says he hath lost out of his cabin.
I did the first office of a justice of Peace to examine a seaman
thereupon, but could find no reason to commit him. This last tide the
Kingsale was also run aboard and lost her mainmast, by another ship,
which makes us think it ominous to the Guiny voyage, to have two of
her ships spoilt before they go out. After dinner, my Lady being very
fearfull she staid and kept my wife there, and I and another gentleman,
a friend of Sir W. Pen’s, went back in the barge, very merry by the
way, as far as Whitehall in her. To the Privy Seal, where I signed
many pardons and some few things else. From thence Mr. Moore and I into
London to a tavern near my house, and there we drank and discoursed of
ways how to put out a little money to the best advantage, and at present
he has persuaded me to put out L250 for L50 per annum for eight years,
and I think I shall do it. Thence home, where I found the wench washing,
and I up to my study, and there did make up an even L100, and sealed it
to lie by. After that to bed.
