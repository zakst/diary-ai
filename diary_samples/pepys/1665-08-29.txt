29th. In the morning waking, among other discourse my wife begun to
tell me the difference between her and Mercer, and that it was only from
restraining her to gad abroad to some Frenchmen that were in the town,
which I do not wholly yet in part believe, and for my quiet would not
enquire into it. So rose and dressed myself, and away by land walking
a good way, then remembered that I had promised Commissioner Pett to go
with him in his coach, and therefore I went back again to him, and so
by his coach to Greenwich, and called at Sir Theophilus Biddulphâ€™s, a
sober, discreet man, to discourse of the preventing of the plague in
Greenwich, and Woolwich, and Deptford, where in every place it begins to
grow very great. We appointed another meeting, and so walked together to
Greenwich and there parted, and Pett and I to the office, where all the
morning, and after office done I to Sir J. Minnes and dined with him,
and thence to Deptford thinking to have seen Bagwell, but did not, and
so straight to Redriffe, and home, and late at my business to dispatch
away letters, and then home to bed, which I did not intend, but to have
staid for altogether at Woolwich, but I made a shift for a bed for Tom,
whose bed is gone to Woolwich, and so to bed.
