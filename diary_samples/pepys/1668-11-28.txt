28th. Up, and all the morning at the Office, where, while I was sitting,
one comes and tells me that my coach is come. So I was forced to go out,
and to Sir Richard Ford’s, where I spoke to him, and he is very willing
to have it brought in, and stand there; and so I ordered it, to my great
content, it being mighty pretty, only the horses do not please me, and,
therefore, resolve to have better. At noon home to dinner, and so to the
office again all the afternoon, and did a great deal of business, and so
home to supper and to bed, with my mind at pretty good ease, having this
day presented to the Board the Duke of York’s letter, which, I perceive,
troubled Sir W. Pen, he declaring himself meant in that part, that
concerned excuse by sickness; but I do not care, but am mightily glad
that it is done, and now I shall begin to be at pretty good ease in
the Office. This morning, to my great content, W. Hewer tells me that a
porter is come, who found my tally in Holborne, and brings it him, for
which he gives him 20s.
