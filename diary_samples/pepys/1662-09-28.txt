28th. Up early, and by six o’clock, after my wife was ready, I walked
with her to the George, at Holborn Conduit, where the coach stood
ready to carry her and her maid to Bugden, but that not being ready, my
brother Tom staid with them to see them gone, and so I took a troubled
though willing goodbye, because of the bad condition of my house to have
a family in it. So I took leave of her and walked to the waterside, and
there took boat for the Tower; hearing that the Queen-Mother is come
this morning already as high as Woolwich: and that my Lord Sandwich was
with her; at which my heart was glad, and I sent the waterman, though
yet not very certain of it, to my wife to carry news thereof to my Lady.
So to my office all the morning abstracting the Duke’s instructions in
the margin thereof. So home all alone to dinner, and then to the office
again, and in the evening Cooper comes, and he being gone, to my chamber
a little troubled and melancholy, to my lute late, and so to bed, Will
lying there at my feet, and the wench in my house in Will’s bed.
