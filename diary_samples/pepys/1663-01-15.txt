150 tons, and fill them with bread of Mr. Gawden’s lying ready there for
Tangier, which they undertake to bear me out in, and to see the freight
paid. This I did. About 10 o’clock we broke up, and my Lord’s fit was
coming upon him, and so we parted, and I with Mr. Creed, Mr. Pierce,
Win. Howe and Captn. Ferrers, who was got almost drunk this afternoon,
and was mighty capricious and ready to fall out with any body, supped
together in the little chamber that was mine heretofore upon some fowls
sent by Mr. Shepley, so we were very merry till 12 at night, and so
away, and I lay with Mr. Creed at his lodgings, and slept well.
