24th. Up, and by 4 o’clock in the morning, and with W. Hewer, there
till 12 without intermission putting some papers in order. Thence to the
Coffee-house with Creed, where I have not been a great while, where all
the newes is of the Dutch being gone out, and of the plague growing upon
us in this towne; and of remedies against it: some saying one thing,
some another. So home to dinner, and after dinner Creed and I to
Colvill’s, thinking to shew him all the respect we could by obliging him
in carrying him 5 tallys of L5000 to secure him for so much credit he
has formerly given Povy to Tangier, but he, like an impertinent fool,
cavills at it, but most ignorantly that ever I heard man in my life.
At last Mr. Viner by chance comes, who I find a very moderate man,
but could not persuade the fool to reason, but brought away the tallys
again, and so vexed to my office, where late, and then home to my supper
and to bed.
