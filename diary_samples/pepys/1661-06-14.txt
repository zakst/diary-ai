14th. To Whitehall to my Lord’s, where I found Mr. Edward Montagu and
his family come to lie during my Lord’s absence. I sent to my house
by my Lord’s order his shipp--[Qy. glass omitted after shipp.]--and
triangle virginall. So to my father’s, and did give him order about the
buying of this cloth to send to my Lord. But I could not stay with him
myself, for having got a great cold by my playing the fool in the water
yesterday I was in great pain, and so went home by coach to bed, and
went not to the office at all, and by keeping myself warm, I broke wind
and so came to some ease. Rose and eat some supper, and so to bed again.
