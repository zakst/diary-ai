25th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church, and thence home; and Pelling comes
by invitation to dine with me, and much pleasant discourse with him.
After dinner, away by water to White Hall, where I landed Pelling, who
is going to his wife, where she is in the country, at Parson’s Greene:
and myself to Westminster, and there at the Swan I did baiser Frank,
and to the parish church, thinking to see Betty Michell; and did stay
an hour in the crowd, thinking, by the end of a nose that I saw, that
it had been her; but at last the head turned towards me, and it was her
mother, which vexed me, and so I back to my boat, which had broke one
of her oars in rowing, and had now fastened it again; and so I up to
Putney, and there stepped into the church, to look upon the fine people
there, whereof there is great store, and the young ladies; and so
walked to Barne-Elmes, whither I sent Russel, reading of Boyle’s
Hydrostatickes, which are of infinite delight. I walked in the Elmes a
good while, and then to my boat, and leisurely home, with great pleasure
to myself; and there supped, and W. Hewer with us, with whom a great
deal of good talk touching the Office, and so to bed.
