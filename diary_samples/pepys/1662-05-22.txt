22d. This morning comes an order from the Secretary of State, Nicholas,
for me to let one Mr. Lee, a Councellor, to view what papers I have
relating to passages of the late times, wherein Sir H. Vane’s hand is
employed, in order to the drawing up his charge; which I did, and at
noon he, with Sir W. Pen and his daughter, dined with me, and he to his
work again, and we by coach to the Theatre and saw “Love in a Maze.” The
play hath little in it but Lacy’s part of a country fellow, which he did
to admiration. So home, and supped with Sir W. Pen, where Sir W.
Batten and Captn. Cocke came to us, to whom I have lately been a great
stranger. This night we had each of us a letter from Captain Teddiman
from the Streights, of a peace made upon good terms, by Sir J. Lawson,
with the Argier men, which is most excellent news? He hath also sent
each of us some anchovies, olives, and muscatt; but I know not yet what
that is, and am ashamed to ask. After supper home, and to bed, resolving
to make up this week in seeing plays and pleasure, and so fall to
business next week again for a great while.
