31st. This morning with Mr. Coventry at Whitehall about getting a ship
to carry my Lord’s deals to Lynne, and we have chosen the Gift. Thence
at noon to my Lord’s, where my Lady not well, so I eat a mouthfull of
dinner there, and thence to the Theatre, and there sat in the pit among
the company of fine ladys, &c.; and the house was exceeding full, to
see Argalus and Parthenia, the first time that it hath been acted: and
indeed it is good, though wronged by my over great expectations, as all
things else are. Thence to my father’s to see my mother, who is pretty
well after her journey from Brampton. She tells me my aunt is pretty
well, yet cannot live long. My uncle pretty well too, and she believes
would marry again were my aunt dead, which God forbid. So home.
