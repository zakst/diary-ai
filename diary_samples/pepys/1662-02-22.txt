22nd. At the office busy all the morning, and thence to dinner to my
Lady Sandwich’s, and thence with Mr. Moore to our Attorney, Wellpoole’s,
and there found that Godfry has basely taken out a judgment against us
for the L40, for which I am vexed. And thence to buy a pair of stands
and a hanging shelf for my wife’s chamber, and so home, and thither came
Mr. Savill with the pictures, and we hung them up in our dining-room. It
comes now to appear very handsome with all my pictures. This evening I
wrote letters to my father; among other things acquainting him with the
unhappy accident which hath happened lately to my Lord of Dorset’s
two oldest sons, who, with two Belasses and one Squire Wentworth, were
lately apprehended for killing and robbing of a tanner about Newington’
on Wednesday last, and are all now in Newgate. I am much troubled
for it, and for the grief and disgrace it brings to their familys and
friends. After this, having got a very great cold, I got something warm
to-night, and so to bed.
