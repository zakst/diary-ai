5th. In the morning to the Painter’s about my little picture. Thence to
Tom’s about business, and so to the pewterer’s, to buy a poore’s-box to
put my forfeits in, upon breach of my late vows. So to the Wardrobe and
dined, and thence home and to my office, and there sat looking over my
papers of my voyage, when we fetched over the King, and tore so many of
these that were worth nothing, as filled my closet as high as my knees.
I staid doing this till 10 at night, and so home and to bed.
