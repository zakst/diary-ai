9th. We having sailed all night, were come in sight of the Nore and
South Forelands in the morning, and so sailed all day. In the afternoon
we had a very fresh gale, which I brooked better than I thought I should
be able to do. This afternoon I first saw France and Calais, with which
I was much pleased, though it was at a distance. About five oâ€™clock we
came to the Goodwin, so to the Castles about Deal; where our Fleet lay,
among whom we anchored. Great was the shout of guns from the castles
and ships, and our answers, that I never heard yet so great rattling of
guns. Nor could we see one another on board for the smoke that was among
us, nor one ship from another. Soon as we came to anchor, the captains
came from on board their ships all to us on board. This afternoon I
wrote letters for my Lord to the Council, &c., which Mr. Dickering was
to carry, who took his leave this night of my Lord, and Balty after I
had wrote two or three letters by him to my wife and Mr. Bowyer, and had
drank a bottle of wine with him in my cabin which J. Goods and W. Howe
brought on purpose, he took leave of me too to go away to-morrow morning
with Mr. Dickering. I lent Balty 15s. which he was to pay to my wife. It
was one in the morning before we parted. This evening Mr. Sheply came
on board, having escaped a very great danger upon a sand coming from
Chatham.
