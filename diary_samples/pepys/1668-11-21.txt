21st. Up, with great joy to my wife and me, and to the office, where
W. Hewer did most honestly bring me back the part of my letter to Deb.
wherein I called her whore, assuring me that he did not shew it her, and
that he did only give her to understand that wherein I did declare my
desire never to see her, and did give her the best Christian counsel
he could, which was mighty well done of him. But by the grace of God,
though I love the poor girl and wish her well, as having gone too far
toward the undoing her, yet I will never enquire after or think of her
more, my peace being certainly to do right to my wife. At the Office all
the morning; and after dinner abroad with W. Hewer to my Lord Ashly’s,
where my Lord Barkeley and Sir Thomas Ingram met upon Mr. Povy’s
account, where I was in great pain about that part of his account
wherein I am concerned, above L150, I think; and Creed hath declared
himself dissatisfied with it, so far as to desire to cut his
“Examinatur” out of the paper, as the only condition in which he would
be silent in it. This Povy had the wit to yield to; and so when it come
to be inquired into, I did avouch the truth of the account as to that
particular, of my own knowledge, and so it went over as a thing good
and just--as, indeed, in the bottom of it, it is; though in strictness,
perhaps, it would not so well be understood. This Committee rising, I,
with my mind much satisfied herein, away by coach home, setting Creed
into Southampton Buildings, and so home; and there ended my letters,
and then home to my wife, where I find my house clean now, from top
to bottom, so as I have not seen it many a day, and to the full
satisfaction of my mind, that I am now at peace, as to my poor wife,
as to the dirtiness of my house, and as to seeing an end, in a great
measure, to my present great disbursements upon my house, and coach and
horses.
