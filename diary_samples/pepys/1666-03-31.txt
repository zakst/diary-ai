31st. Rising this day with a full design to mind nothing else but to
make up my accounts for the year past, I did take money, and walk forth
to several places in the towne as far as the New Exchange, to pay all
my debts, it being still a very great frost and good walking. I staid at
the Fleece Tavern in Covent Garden while my boy Tom went to W. Joyce’s
to pay what I owed for candles there. Thence to the New Exchange to
clear my wife’s score, and so going back again I met Doll Lane (Mrs.
Martin’s sister), with another young woman of the Hall, one Scott, and
took them to the Half Moon Taverne and there drank some burnt wine with
them, without more pleasure, and so away home by coach, and there to
dinner, and then to my accounts, wherein, at last, I find them clear and
right; but, to my great discontent, do find that my gettings this year
have been L573 less than my last: it being this year in all but L2,986;
whereas, the last, I got L3,560. And then again my spendings this year
have exceeded my spendings the last by L644: my whole spendings last
year being but L509; whereas this year, it appears, I have spent L1154,
which is a sum not fit to be said that ever I should spend in one year,
before I am master of a better estate than I am. Yet, blessed be God!
and I pray God make me thankful for it, I do find myself worth in money,
all good, above L6,200; which is above L1800 more than I was the last
year. This, I trust in God, will make me thankfull for what I have,
and carefull to make up by care next year what by my negligence and
prodigality I have lost and spent this year. The doing of this, and
entering of it fair, with the sorting of all my expenses, to see how
and in what points I have exceeded, did make it late work, till my eyes
become very sore and ill, and then did give over, and supper, and to
bed. Thus ends this year of publick wonder and mischief to this nation,
and, therefore, generally wished by all people to have an end. Myself
and family well, having four mayds and one clerk, Tom, in my house, and
my brother, now with me, to spend time in order to his preferment.
Our healths all well, only my eyes with overworking them are sore as
candlelight comes to them, and not else; publick matters in a most sad
condition; seamen discouraged for want of pay, and are become not to be
governed: nor, as matters are now, can any fleete go out next year.
Our enemies, French and Dutch, great, and grow more by our poverty. The
Parliament backward in raising, because jealous of the spending of
the money; the City less and less likely to be built again, every body
settling elsewhere, and nobody encouraged to trade. A sad, vicious,
negligent Court, and all sober men there fearful of the ruin of the
whole kingdom this next year; from which, good God deliver us! One thing
I reckon remarkable in my owne condition is, that I am come to abound in
good plate, so as at all entertainments to be served wholly with silver
plates, having two dozen and a half.
