12th (Lord’s day). Lay till 8 o’clock, which I have not done a great
while, then up and to church, where I found our pew altered by taking
some of the hind pew to make ours bigger, because of the number of
women, more by Sir J. Minnes company than we used to have. Home
to dinner, and after dinner, intending to go to Chelsey to my Lord
Sandwich, my wife would needs go with me, though she walked on foot to
Whitehall. Which she did and staid at my Lord’s lodgings while Creed and
I took a turn at Whitehall, but no coach to be had, and so I returned
to them and sat talking till evening, and then got a coach and to Gray’s
Inn walks, where some handsome faces, and so home and there to supper,
and a little after 8 o’clock to bed, a thing I have not done God knows
when. Coming home to-night, a drunken boy was carrying by our constable
to our new pair of stocks to handsel them, being a new pair and very
handsome.
