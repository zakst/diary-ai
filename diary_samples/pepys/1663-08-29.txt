29th. Abroad with my wife by water to Westminster, and there left her at
my Lord’s lodgings, and I to Jervas the barber’s, and there was trimmed,
and did deliver back a periwigg, which he brought by my desire the
other day to show me, having some thoughts, though no great desire or
resolution yet to wear one, and so I put it off for a while. Thence to
my wife, and calling at both the Exchanges, buying stockings for her and
myself, and also at Leadenhall, where she and I, it being candlelight,
bought meat for to-morrow, having never a mayde to do it, and I myself
bought, while my wife was gone to another shop, a leg of beef, a good
one, for six pense, and my wife says is worth my money. So walked home
with a woman carrying our things. I am mightily displeased at a letter
Tom sent me last night, to borrow L20 more of me, and yet gives me
no account, as I have long desired, how matters stand with him in the
world. I am troubled also to see how, contrary to my expectation, my
brother John neither is the scholler nor minds his studies as I thought
would have done, but loiters away his time, so that I must send him soon
to Cambridge again.
