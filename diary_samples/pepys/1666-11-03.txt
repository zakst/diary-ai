3rd. This morning comes Mr. Lovett, and brings me my print of the
Passion, varnished by him, and the frame black, which indeed is very
fine, though not so fine as I expected; however, pleases me exceedingly.
This, and the sheets of paper he prepared for me, come to L3, which I
did give him, and though it be more than is fit to lay out on pleasure,
yet, it being ingenious, I did not think much of it. He gone, I to the
office, where all the morning to little purpose, nothing being before us
but clamours for money: So at noon home to dinner, and after dinner to
hang up my new varnished picture and set my chamber in order to be made
clean, and then to; the office again, and there all the afternoon till
late at night, and so to supper and to bed.
