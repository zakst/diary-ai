2nd. Up, and at the office all the morning upon some accounts of Sir
D. Gawden, and at noon abroad with W. Hewer, thinking to have found
Mr. Wren at Captain Cox’s, to have spoke something to him about doing a
favour for Will’s uncle Steventon, but missed him. And so back home and
abroad with my wife, the first time that ever I rode in my own coach,
which do make my heart rejoice, and praise God, and pray him to bless it
to me and continue it. So she and I to the King’s playhouse, and there
sat to avoid seeing Knepp in a box above where Mrs. Williams happened to
be, and there saw “The Usurper;” a pretty good play, in all but what is
designed to resemble Cromwell and Hugh Peters, which is mighty silly.
The play done, we to White Hall; where my wife staid while I up to the
Duchesse’s and Queen’s side, to speak with the Duke of York: and here
saw all the ladies, and heard the silly discourse of the King, with his
people about him, telling a story of my Lord Rochester’s having of his
clothes stole, while he was with a wench; and his gold all gone, but his
clothes found afterwards stuffed into a feather bed by the wench that
stole them. I spoke with the Duke of York, just as he was set down
to supper with the King, about our sending of victuals to Sir Thomas
Allen’s fleet hence to Cales [Cadiz] to meet him. And so back to my wife
in my coach, and so with great content and joy home, where I made my boy
to make an end of the Reall Character, which I begun a great while ago,
and do please me infinitely, and indeed is a most worthy labour, and I
think mighty easy, though my eyes make me unable to attempt any thing in
it. To-day I hear that Mr. Ackworth’s cause went for him at Guildhall,
against his accusers, which I am well enough pleased with.
