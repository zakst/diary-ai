21st. At the office all the morning, and at noon home to dinner with
my Clerks and Creed, who among other things all alone, after dinner,
talking of the times, he tells me that the Nonconformists are mighty
high, and their meetings frequented and connived at; and they do expect
to have their day now soon; for my Lord of Buckingham is a declared
friend to them, and even to the Quakers, who had very good words the
other day from the King himself: and, what is more, the Archbishop
of Canterbury is called no more to the Cabal, nor, by the way, Sir W.
Coventry; which I am sorry for, the Cabal at present being, as he
says, the King, and Duke of Buckingham, and Lord Keeper, the Duke of
Albemarle, and Privy Seale. The Bishops, differing from the King in the
late business in the House of Lords, having caused this and what is like
to follow, for every body is encouraged nowadays to speak, and even to
preach, as I have heard one of them, as bad things against them as ever
in the year 1640; which is a strange change. He gone, I to the office,
where busy till late at night, and then home to sit with my wife, who
is a little better, and her cheek asswaged. I read to her out of “The
History of Algiers,” which is mighty pretty reading, and did discourse
alone about my sister Pall’s match, which is now on foot with one
Jackson, another nephew of Mr. Phillips’s, to whom he hath left his
estate.
