13th. Up pretty early and to my office all the morning busy. At noon
home to dinner expecting Ashwell’s father, who was here in the morning
and promised to come but he did not, but there came in Captain Grove,
and I found him to be a very stout man, at least in his discourse he
would be thought so, and I do think that he is, and one that bears
me great respect and deserves to be encouraged for his care in all
business. Abroad by water with my wife and Ashwell, and left them at
Mr. Pierce’s, and I to Whitehall and St. James’s Park (there being no
Commission for Tangier sitting to-day as I looked for) where I walked
an hour or two with great pleasure, it being a most pleasant day. So to
Mrs. Hunt’s, and there found my wife, and so took them up by coach, and
carried them to Hide Park, where store of coaches and good faces. Here
till night, and so home and to my office to write by the post, and so to
supper and to bed.
