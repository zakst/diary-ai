20th. Waked this morning, about six o’clock, with a violent knocking at
Sir J. Minnes’s doore, to call up Mrs. Hammon, crying out that Sir J.
Minnes is a-dying. He come home ill of an ague on Friday night. I saw
him on Saturday, after his fit of the ague, and then was pretty lusty.
Which troubles me mightily, for he is a very good, harmless, honest
gentleman, though not fit for the business. But I much fear a worse
may come, that may be more uneasy to me. Up, and to Deptford by water,
reading “Othello, Moore of Venice,” which I ever heretofore esteemed
a mighty good play, but having so lately read “The Adventures of Five
Houres,” it seems a mean thing. Walked back, and so home, and then down
to the Old Swan and drank at Betty Michell’s, and so to Westminster to
the Exchequer about my quarter tallies, and so to Lumbard Streete to
choose stuff to hang my new intended closet, and have chosen purple.
So home to dinner, and all the afternoon till almost midnight upon my
Tangier accounts, getting Tom Wilson to help me in writing as I read,
and at night W. Hewer, and find myself most happy in the keeping of all
my accounts, for that after all the changings and turnings necessary
in such an account, I find myself right to a farthing in an account of
L127,000. This afternoon I visited Sir J. Minnes, who, poor man, is much
impatient by these few days’ sickness, and I fear indeed it will kill
him.
