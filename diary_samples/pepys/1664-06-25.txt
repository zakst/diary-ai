25th. We staid late, and he lay with me all night and rose very merry
talking, and excellent company he is, that is the truth of it, and a
most cunning man. He being gone I to the office, where we sat all the
morning. At noon to dinner, and then to my office busy, and by and by
home with Mr. Deane to a lesson upon raising a Bend of Timbers,

     [This seems to refer to knee timber, of which there was not a
     sufficient supply.  A proposal was made to produce this bent wood
     artificially: “June 22, 1664.  Sir William Petty intimated that it
     seemed by the scarcity and greater rate of knee timber that nature
     did not furnish crooked wood enough for building: wherefore he
     thought it would be fit to raise by art, so much of it in
     proportion, as to reduce it to an equal rate with strait timber”
      (Birch’s “History of the Royal Society,”)]

and he being gone I to the office, and there came Captain Taylor, and he
and I home, and I have done all very well with him as to the business of
the last trouble, so that come what will come my name will be clear of
any false dealing with him. So to my office again late, and then to bed.
