About 10 at night the Prince comes home, and we found an easy admission.
His attendance very inconsiderable as for a prince; but yet handsome,
and his tutor a fine man, and himself a very pretty boy. It was bright
moonshine to-night. This done we went to a place we had taken to sup
in, where a sallet and two or three bones of mutton were provided for a
matter of ten of us which was very strange. After supper the Judge and I
to another house, leaving them there, and he and I lay in one press bed,
there being two more in the same room, but all very neat and handsome,
my boy sleeping upon a bench by me.
