21st. Up betimes and to my office, where first I ruled with red ink my
English “Mare Clausum,” which, with the new orthodox title, makes it now
very handsome. So to business, and then home to dinner, and after dinner
to sit at the office in the afternoon, and thence to my study late, and
so home to supper to play a game at cards with my wife, and so to bed.
Ashwell plays well at cards, and will teach us to play; I wish it do not
lose too much of my time, and put my wife too much upon it.
