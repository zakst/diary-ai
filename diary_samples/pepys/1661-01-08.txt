8th. My wife and I lay very long in bed to-day talking and pleasing one
another in discourse. Being up, Mr. Warren came, and he and I agreed
for the deals that my Lord is to, have. Then Will and I to Westminster,
where I dined with my Lady. After dinner I took my Lord Hinchinbroke and
Mr. Sidney to the Theatre, and shewed them “The Widdow,” an indifferent
good play, but wronged by the women being to seek in their parts. That
being done, my Lord’s coach waited for us, and so back to my Lady’s,
where she made me drink of some Florence wine, and did give me two
bottles for my wife. From thence walked to my cozen Stradwick’s,
and there chose a small banquet and some other things against our
entertainment on Thursday next. Thence to Tom Pepys and bought a dozen
of trenchers, and so home. Some talk to-day of a head of Fanatiques
that do appear about Barnett, but I do not believe it. However, my Lord
Mayor, Sir Richd. Browne, hath carried himself very honourably, and hath
caused one of their meeting-houses in London to be pulled down.
