15th. To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.
Pen carried me to Paul’s, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with
my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord’s sickness (of which though
it hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and
recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.
I found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.
Thence to the Opera, which begins again to-day with “The Witts,” never
acted yet with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who
dined to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state);
and indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes. So
home and was overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this
afternoon with my Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre. So I followed him
to the Dolphin, where Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and
so home after we had made shift to fuddle Mr. Falconer of Woolwich. So
home.
