31st. And to that purpose I lay long talking with my wife about my
father’s coming, which I expect to-day, coming up with the horses
brought up for my Lord. Up and to my office, where doing business all
the morning, and at Sir W. Batten’s, whither Mr. Gauden and many others
came to us about business. Then home to dinner, where W. Joyce came,
and he still a talking impertinent fellow. So to the office again, and
hearing by and by that Madam Clerke, Pierce, and others were come to see
my wife I stepped in and staid a little with them, and so to the office
again, where late, and so home to supper and to bed.
