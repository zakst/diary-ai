11th. All the morning at the office. Dined at home all alone, and so to
my office again, whither Dean Fuller came to see me, and having business
about a ship to carry his goods to Dublin, whither he is shortly to
return, I went with him to the Hermitage, and the ship happening to be
Captn. Hollandâ€™s I did give orders for them to be well looked after, and
thence with him to the Custom House about getting a pass for them, and
so to the Dolphin tavern, where I spent 6d. on him, but drank but one
glass of wine, and so parted. He tells me that his niece, that sings
so well, whom I have long longed to see, is married to one Mr. Boys, a
wholesale man at the Three Crowns in Cheapside. I to the office again,
whither Cooper came and read his last lecture to me upon my modell, and
so bid me good bye, he being to go to-morrow to Chatham to take charge
of the ship I have got him. So to my business till 9 at night, and so
to supper and to bed, my mind a little at ease because my house is now
quite tiled.
