8th. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon to the ‘Change,
expecting to have received from Mr. Houbland, as he promised me, an
assignment upon Viner, for my reward for my getting them the going of
their two ships to Tangier, but I find myself much disappointed therein,
for I spoke with him and he said nothing of it, but looked coldly,
through some disturbance he meets with in our business through Colonell
Norwood’s pressing them to carry more goods than will leave room for
some of their own. But I shall ease them. Thence to Captain Cocke’s,
where Mr. Williamson, Wren, Boldell and Madam Williams, and by and by
Lord Bruncker, he having been with the King and Duke upon the water
to-day, to see Greenwich house, and the yacht Castle is building of, and
much good discourse. So to White Hall to see my Lord Sandwich, and then
home to my business till night, and then to bed.
