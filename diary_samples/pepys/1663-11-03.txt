3rd. Up and to the office, where busy all the morning, and at noon to
the Coffee-house, and there heard a long and most passionate discourse
between two doctors of physique, of which one was Dr. Allen, whom I knew
at Cambridge, and a couple of apothecarys; these maintaining chymistry
against them Galenicall physique; and the truth is, one of the
apothecarys whom they charged most, did speak very prettily, that is,
his language and sense good, though perhaps he might not be so knowing
a physician as to offer to contest with them. At last they came to some
cooler terms, and broke up. I home, and there Mr. Moore coming by my
appointment dined with me, and after dinner came Mr. Goldsborough, and
we discoursed about the business of his mother, but could come to no
agreement in it but parted dissatisfied. By and by comes Chapman, the
periwigg-maker, and upon my liking it, without more ado I went up, and
there he cut off my haire, which went a little to my heart at present to
part with it; but, it being over, and my periwigg on, I paid him L3 for
it; and away went he with my owne haire to make up another of, and I
by and by, after I had caused all my mayds to look upon it; and they
conclude it do become me; though Jane was mightily troubled for
my parting of my own haire, and so was Besse, I went abroad to the
Coffeehouse, and coming back went to Sir W. Pen and there sat with him
and Captain Cocke till late at night, Cocke talking of some of the
Roman history very well, he having a good memory. Sir W. Pen observed
mightily, and discoursed much upon my cutting off my haire, as he do of
every thing that concerns me, but it is over, and so I perceive after a
day or two it will be no great matter.
