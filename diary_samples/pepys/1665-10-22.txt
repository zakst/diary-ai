22nd (Lord’s day). Up, and after ready and going to Captain Cocke’s,
where I find we are a little further safe in some part of our goods,
I to Church, in my way was meeting with some letters, which made me
resolve to go after church to my Lord Duke of Albemarle’s, so, after
sermon, I took Cocke’s chariott, and to Lambeth; but, in going and
getting over the water, and through White Hall, I spent so much time,
the Duke had almost dined. However, fresh meat was brought for me to his
table, and there I dined, and full of discourse and very kind. Here they
are again talking of the prizes, and my Lord Duke did speake very broad
that my Lord Sandwich and Pen should do what they would, and answer
for themselves. For his part, he would lay all before the King. Here he
tells me the Dutch Embassador at Oxford is clapped up, but since I hear
it is not true. Thence back again, it being evening before I could
get home, and there Cocke not being within, I and Mr. Salomon to Mr.
Glanville’s, and there we found Cocke and sat and supped, and was mighty
merry with only Madam Penington, who is a fine, witty lady. Here we
spent the evening late with great mirth, and so home and to bed.
