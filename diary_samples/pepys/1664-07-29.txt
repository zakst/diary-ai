29th. At the office all the morning dispatching of business, at noon
to the ‘Change after dinner, and thence to Tom Trice about Dr. Pepys’s
business, and thence it raining turned into Fleet Alley, and there was
with Cocke an hour or so. The jade, whether I would not give her money
or not enough; she would not offer to invite to do anything, but on the
contrary saying she had no time, which I was glad of, for I had no mind
to meddle with her, but had my end to see what a cunning jade she was,
to see her impudent tricks and ways of getting money and raising the
reckoning by still calling for things, that it come to 6 or 7 shillings
presently. So away home, glad I escaped without any inconvenience,
and there came Mr. Hill, Andrews and Seignor Pedro, and great store of
musique we had, but I begin to be weary of having a master with us, for
it spoils, methinks, the ingenuity of our practice. After they were
gone comes Mr. Bland to me, sat till 11 at night with me, talking of
the garrison of Tangier and serving them with pieces of eight. A mind he
hath to be employed there, but dares not desire any courtesy of me, and
yet would fain engage me to be for him, for I perceive they do all find
that I am the busy man to see the King have right done him by inquiring
out other bidders. Being quite tired with him, I got him gone, and so to
bed.
