30th. Lay long in bed with my wife, and then up and a while at my
office, and so to the Change, and so [home] again, and there I found my
wife in a great passion with her mayds. I upstairs to set some things in
order in our chamber and wardrobe, and so to dinner upon a good dish of
stewed beef, then up again about my business. Then by coach with my wife
to the New Exchange, and there bought and paid for several things, and
then back, calling at my periwigg-makers, and there showed my wife
the periwigg made for me, and she likes it very well, and so to my
brotherâ€™s, and to buy a pair of boddice for her, and so home, and to
my office late, and then home to my wife, purposing to go on to a new
lesson in arithmetique with her. So to supper and to bed. The Queen
mends apace, but her head still light. My mind very heavy thinking of my
great layings out lately, and what they must still be for clothes, but
I hope it is in order to getting of something the more by it, for I
perceive how I have hitherto suffered for lack of going as becomes my
place. After a little discourse with my wife upon arithmetique, to bed.
