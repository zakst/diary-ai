2nd Doorkeeper.  So you say every day, and see two or three

In the pit I met with Sir Ch. North, formerly Mr. North, who was with my
Lord at sea; and he, of his own accord, was so silly as to tell me he
is married; and for her quality (being a Lord’s daughter, my Lord Grey),
and person, and beauty, and years, and estate, and disposition, he is
the happiest man in the world. I am sure he is an ugly fellow; but
a good scholar and sober gentleman; and heir to his father, now Lord
North, the old Lord being dead.
