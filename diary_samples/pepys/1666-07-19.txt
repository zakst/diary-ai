19th. Up in very good health in every respect, only my late fever got
by my pain do break out about my mouth. So to the office, where all the
morning sitting. Full of wants of money, and much stores to buy, for to
replenish the stores, and no money to do it with, nor anybody to trust
us without it. So at noon home to dinner, Balty and his wife with us. By
and by Balty takes his leave of us, he going away just now towards the
fleete, where he will pass through one great engagement more before
he be two days older, I believe. I to the office, where busy all the
afternoon, late, and then home, and, after some pleasant discourse to
my wife, to bed. After I was in bed I had a letter from Sir W. Coventry
that tells me that the fleete is sailed this morning; God send us good
newes of them!
