26th. Up and to Westminster, and there to the Swan, and by chance met
Mr. Spicer and another ‘Chequer clerk, and there made them drink, and
there talked of the credit the ‘Chequer is now come to and will in a
little time, and so away homeward, and called at my bookseller’s, and
there bought Mr. Harrington’s works, “Oceana,” &c., and two other books,
which cost me L4, and so home, and there eat a bit, and then with my
wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Surprizall;” which did
not please me to-day, the actors not pleasing me; and especially Nell’s
acting of a serious part, which she spoils. Here met with Sir W. Pen,
and sat by him, and home by coach with him, and there to my office a
while, and then home to supper and to bed. I hear this day that Mrs.
Stewart do at this day keep a great court at Somerset House, with her
husband the Duke of Richmond, she being visited for her beauty’s sake by
people, as the Queen is, at nights; and they say also that she is likely
to go to Court again, and there put my Lady Castlemayne’s nose out of
joynt. God knows that would make a great turn. This day I was invited to
have gone to my cozen Mary Pepys’ burial, my uncle Thomas’ daughter, but
could not.
