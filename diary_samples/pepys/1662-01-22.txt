22d. After musique-practice, to White Hall, and thence to Westminster,
in my way calling at Mr. George Montagu’s, to condole him the loss of
his son, who was a fine gentleman, and it is no doubt a great discomfort
to our two young gentlemen, his companions in France. After this
discourse he told me, among other news, the great jealousys that are now
in the Parliament House. The Lord Chancellor, it seems, taking occasion
from this late plot to raise fears in the people, did project the
raising of an army forthwith, besides the constant militia, thinking to
make the Duke of York General thereof. But the House did, in very open
terms, say, they were grown too wise to be fooled again into another
army; and said they had found how that man that hath the command of an
army is not beholden to any body to make him King. There are factions
(private ones at Court) about Madam Palmer; but what it is about I know
not. But it is something about the King’s favour to her now that the
Queen is coming. He told me, too, what sport the King and Court do
make at Mr. Edward Montagu’s leaving his things behind him. But the
Chancellor (taking it a little more seriously) did openly say to my Lord
Chamberlain, that had it been such a gallant as my Lord Mandeville his
son, it might have; been taken as a frolique; but for him that would be
thought a grave coxcomb, it was very strange. Thence to the Hall, where
I heard the House had ordered all the King’s murderers, that remain,
to be executed, but Fleetwood and Downes. So to the Wardrobe and there
dined, meeting my wife there, who went after dinner with my Lady to see
Mr. George Montagu’s lady, and I to have a meeting by appointment with
Tho. Trice and Dr. Williams in order to a treating about the difference
between us, but I find there is no hopes of ending it but by law, and
so after a pint or two of wine we parted. So to the Wardrobe for my wife
again, and so home, and after writing and doing some things to bed.
