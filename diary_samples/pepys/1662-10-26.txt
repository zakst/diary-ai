26th. Up, my wife to the making of Christmas pies all day, being now
pretty well again, and I abroad to several places about some businesses,
among others bought a bake-pan in Newgate Market, and sent it home,
it cost me 16s. So to Dr. Williams, but he is out of town, then to the
Wardrobe. Hither come Mr. Battersby; and we falling into a discourse of
a new book of drollery in verse called Hudebras,

     [The first edition of Butler’s “Hudibras” is dated 1663, and it
     probably had only been published a few days when Pepys bought it and
     sold it at a loss.  He subsequently endeavoured to appreciate the
     work, but was not successful.  The edition in the Pepysian Library
     is dated 1689.]

I would needs go find it out, and met with it at the Temple: cost me 2s.
