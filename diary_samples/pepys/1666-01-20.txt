20th. To the office, where upon Mr. Kinaston’s coming to me about some
business of Colonell Norwood’s, I sent my boy home for some papers,
where, he staying longer than I would have him, and being vexed at the
business and to be kept from my fellows in the office longer than was
fit, I become angry, and boxed my boy when he came, that I do hurt my
thumb so much, that I was not able to stir all the day after, and in
great pain. At noon to dinner, and then to the office again, late, and
so to supper and to bed.
