18th. Lay long in bed, then up to the office (we having changed our days
to Tuesday and Saturday in the morning and Thursday at night), and by
and by with Sir W. Pen, Mr. Kennard, and others to survey his house
again, and to contrive for the alterations there, which will be handsome
I think. After we had done at the office, I walked to the Wardrobe,
where with Mr. Moore and Mr. Lewis Phillips after dinner we did agree
upon the agreement between us and Prior and I did seal and sign it.
Having agreed with Sir Wm. Pen and my wife to meet them at the Opera,
and finding by my walking in the streets, which were every where full
of brick-battes and tyles flung down by the extraordinary wind the last
night (such as hath not been in memory before, unless at the death
of the late Protector), that it was dangerous to go out of doors; and
hearing how several persons had been killed to-day by the fall of things
in the streets, and that the pageant in Fleetstreet is most of it blown
down, and hath broke down part of several houses, among others Dick
Brigden’s; and that one Lady Sanderson, a person of quality in Covent
Garden, was killed by the fall of the house, in her bed, last night;
I sent my boy home to forbid them to go forth. But he bringing me
word that they are gone, I went thither and there saw “The Law against
Lovers,” a good play and well performed, especially the little girl’s
(whom I never saw act before) dancing and singing; and were it not for
her, the loss of Roxalana would spoil the house. So home and to musique,
and so to bed.
