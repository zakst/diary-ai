20th. All the morning at the office, dined at home and my brother Tom
with me, who brought me a pair of fine slippers which he gave me. By and
by comes little Luellin and friend to see me, and then my coz Stradwick,
who was never here before. With them I drank a bottle of wine or two,
and to the office again, and there staid about business late, and
then all of us to Sir W. Penâ€™s, where we had, and my Lady Batten, Mrs.
Martha, and my wife, and other company, a good supper, and sat playing
at cards and talking till 12 at night, and so all to our lodgings.
