23s. per chaldron, a good hearing, I thank God-having not been put to
buy a coal all this dear time, that during this war poor people have
been forced to give 45s. and 50s., and L3. In the afternoon (my wife and
people busy these late days, and will be for some time, making of shirts
and smocks) to the office, where late, and then home, after letters,
and so to supper and to bed, with much pleasure of mind, after having
dispatched business. This afternoon I spent some time walking with
Mr. Moore, in the garden, among other things discoursing of my Lord
Sandwich’s family, which he tells me is in a very bad condition, for
want of money and management, my Lord’s charging them with bills, and
nobody, nor any thing provided to answer them. He did discourse of his
hopes of being supplied with L1900 against a present bill from me, but
I took no notice of it, nor will do it. It seems Mr. Sheply doubts his
accounts are ill kept, and every thing else in the family out of order,
which I am grieved to hear of.
