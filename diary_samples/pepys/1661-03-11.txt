11th. At the office all the morning, dined at home and my father and
Dr. Thos. Pepys with him upon a poor dinner, my wife being abroad. After
dinner I went to the theatre, and there saw “Love’s Mistress” done by
them, which I do not like in some things as well as their acting in
Salsbury Court. At night home and found my wife come home, and among
other things she hath got her teeth new done by La Roche, and are indeed
now pretty handsome, and I was much pleased with it. So to bed.
