3rd. Up, and by water to White Hall and St. James’s, where I did much
business, and about noon meeting Dr. Gibbons, carried him to the Sun
taverne, in King Street, and there made him, and some friends of his,
drink; among others, Captain Silas Taylor, and here did get Gibbons to
promise me some things for my flageolets. So to the Old Exchange, and
then home to dinner, and so, Mercer dining with us, I took my wife
and her and Deb. out to Unthanke’s, while I to White Hall to the
Commissioners of the Treasury, and so back to them and took them out to
Islington, where we met with W. Joyce and his wife and boy, and there
eat and drank, and a great deal of his idle talk, and so we round by
Hackney home, and so to sing a little in the garden, and then to bed.
