28th. Up early to put things in order in my chamber, and then to my
Lord’s, with whom I spoke about several things, and so up and down
in several places about business with Mr. Creed, among others to Mr.
Wotton’s the shoemaker, and there drank our morning draft, and then home
about noon, and by and by comes my father by appointment to dine with
me, which we did very merrily, I desiring to make him as merry as I can,
while the poor man is in town. After dinner comes my uncle Wight and
sat awhile and talked with us, and thence we three to the Mum House at
Leadenhall, and there sat awhile. Then I left them, and to the Wardrobe,
where I found my Lord gone to Hampton Court. Here I staid all the
afternoon till late with Creed and Captain Ferrers, thinking whether
we should go to-morrow together to Hampton Court, but Ferrers his wife
coming in by and by to the house with the young ladies (with whom she
had been abroad), she was unwilling to go, whereupon I was willing to
put off our going, and so home, but still my mind was hankering after
our going to-morrow. So to bed.
