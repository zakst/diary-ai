18th. This morning early Sir W. Batten went to Rochester, where he
expects to be chosen Parliament man. At the office all the morning,
dined at home and with my wife to Westminster, where I had business with
the Commissioner for paying the seamen about my Lord’s pay, and my wife
at Mrs. Hunt’s. I called her home, and made inquiry at Greatorex’s
and in other places to hear of Mr. Barlow (thinking to hear that he is
dead), but I cannot find it so, but the contrary. Home and called at
my Lady Batten’s, and supped there, and so home. This day an ambassador
from Florence was brought into the town in state. Good hopes given me
to-day that Mrs. Davis is going away from us, her husband going shortly
to Ireland. Yesterday it was said was to be the day that the Princess
Henrietta was to marry the Duke d’Anjou’ in France. This day I found in
the newes-booke that Roger Pepys is chosen at Cambridge for the town,
the first place that we hear of to have made their choice yet. To bed
with my head and mind full of business, which do a little put me out
of order, and I do find myself to become more and more thoughtful about
getting of money than ever heretofore.
