2nd. [Up] and to the office, where we sat, and in discourse at the table
with Sir W. Batten, I was obliged to tell him it was an untruth, which
did displease him mightily, and parted at noon very angry with me. At
home find Lovett, who brought me some papers varnished, and showed me
my crucifix, which will be very fine when done. He dined with me and
Balty’s wife, who is in great pain for her husband, not hearing of him
since the fight; but I understand he was not in it, going hence too
late, and I am glad of it. Thence to the office, and thither comes to
me Creed, and he and I walked a good while, and then to the victualling
office together, and there with Mr. Gawden I did much business, and
so away with Creed again, and by coach to see my Lord Bruncker, who it
seems was not well yesterday, but being come thither, I find his coach
ready to carry him abroad, but Tom, his footman, whatever the matter
was, was lothe to desire me to come in, but I walked a great while in
the Piatza till I was going away, but by and by my Lord himself comes
down and coldly received me. So I soon parted, having enough for my over
officious folly in troubling myself to visit him, and I am apt to think
that he was fearfull that my coming was out of design to see how he
spent his time [rather] than to enquire after his health. So parted, and
I with Creed down to the New Exchange Stairs, and there I took water,
and he parted, so home, and then down to Woolwich, reading and making an
end of the “Rival Ladys,” and find it a very pretty play. At Woolwich,
it being now night, I find my wife and Mercer, and Mr. Batelier and Mary
there, and a supper getting ready. So I staid, in some pain, it being
late, and post night. So supped and merrily home, but it was twelve at
night first. However, sent away some letters, and home to bed.
