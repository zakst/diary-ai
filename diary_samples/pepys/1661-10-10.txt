10th. At the office all the morning; dined at home, and after dinner
Sir W. Pen and my wife and I to the Theatre (she first going into Covent
Garden to speak a word with a woman to enquire of her mother, and I in
the meantime with Sir W. Pen’s coach staying at W. Joyce’s), where the
King came to-day, and there was “The Traytor” most admirably acted; and
a most excellent play it is. So home, and intended to be merry, it being
my sixth wedding night; but by a late bruise.... I am in so much pain
that I eat my supper and in pain to bed, yet my wife and I pretty merry.
