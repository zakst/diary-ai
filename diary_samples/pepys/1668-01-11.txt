11th. Lay some time, talking with my wife in bed about Pall’s business,
and she do conclude to have her married here, and to be merry at it;
and to have W. Hewer, and Batelier, and Mercer, and Willet bridemen and
bridemaids, and to be very merry; and so I am glad of it, and do resolve
to let it be done as soon as I can. So up, and to the office, where
all the morning busy, and thence home to dinner, and from dinner with
Mercer, who dined with us, and wife and Deb. to the King’s house, there
to see “The Wild-goose Chase,” which I never saw, but have long longed
to see it, being a famous play, but as it was yesterday I do find that
where I expect most I find least satisfaction, for in this play I met
with nothing extraordinary at all, but very dull inventions and designs.
Knepp come and sat by us, and her talk pleased me a little, she telling
me how Mis Davis is for certain going away from the Duke’s house,
the King being in love with her; and a house is taken for her, and
furnishing; and she hath a ring given her already worth L600: that the
King did send several times for Nelly, and she was with him, but what he
did she knows not; this was a good while ago, and she says that the King
first spoiled Mrs. Weaver, which is very mean, methinks, in a prince,
and I am sorry for it, and can hope for no good to the State from having
a Prince so devoted to his pleasure. She told me also of a play shortly
coming upon the stage, of Sir Charles Sidly’s, which, she thinks, will
be called “The Wandering Ladys,” a comedy that, she thinks, will be most
pleasant; and also another play, called “The Duke of Lerma;” besides
“Catelin,” which she thinks, for want of the clothes which the King
promised them, will not be acted for a good while. Thence home, and
there to the office and did some business, and so with my wife for half
an hour walking in the moonlight, and it being cold, frosty weather,
walking in the garden, and then home to supper, and so by the fireside
to have my head combed, as I do now often do, by Deb., whom I love
should be fiddling about me, and so to bed.
