29th. At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry. After dinner the two women went to visit
my aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad
to my bookseller, and there staid till four o’clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner’s. So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr. Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion,
but that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give
where there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and
so we friendly ended. There parted, my father and I together, and walked
a little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another,
he being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning. So I home.
