25th. Up, and by water to St. James’s, and there, with Mr. Wren, did
discourse about my great letter, which the Duke of York hath given him:
and he hath set it to be transcribed by Billings, his man, whom, as he
tells me, he can most confide in for secresy, and is much pleased with
it, and earnest to have it be; and he and I are like to be much together
in the considering how to reform the Office, and that by the Duke of
York’s command. Thence I, mightily pleased with this success, away to
the Office, where all the morning, my head full of this business. And
it is pretty how Lord Brouncker this day did tell me how he hears that
a design is on foot to remove us out of the Office: and proposes that
we two do agree to draw up a form of a new constitution of the Office,
there to provide remedies for the evils we are now under, so that we may
be beforehand with the world, which I agreed to, saying nothing of my
design; and, the truth is, he is the best man of them all, and I would
be glad, next myself, to save him; for, as he deserves best, so I
doubt he needs his place most. So home to dinner at noon, and all the
afternoon busy at the office till night, and then with my mind full of
business now in my head, I to supper and to bed.
