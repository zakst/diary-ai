9th. And did keep my bed most of this morning, my body I find being
still bound and little wind, and so my pain returned again, though not
so bad, but keeping my body with warm clothes very hot I made shift to
endure it, and at noon sent word to Mr. Hollyard of my condition, that
I could neither have a natural stool nor break wind, and by that means
still in pain and frequent offering to make water. So he sent me two
bottles of drink and some syrup, one bottle to take now and the other
to-morrow morning. So in the evening, after Commissioner Pett, who came
to visit me, and was going to Chatham, but methinks do talk to me in
quite another manner, doubtfully and shyly, and like a stranger, to what
he did heretofore. After I saw he was gone I did drink one of them, but
it was a most loathsome draught, and did keep myself warm after it, and
had that afternoon still a stool or two, but in no plenty, nor any wind
almost carried away, and so to bed. In no great pain, but do not think
myself likely to be well till I have a freedom of stool and wind. Most
of this day and afternoon my wife and I did spend together in setting
things now up and in order in her closet, which indeed is, and will be,
when I can get her some more things to put in it, a very pleasant place,
and is at present very pretty, and such as she, I hope, will find great
content in. So to bed.
