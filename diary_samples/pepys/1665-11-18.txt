18th. About nine of the clock, I went on shore, there (calling by the
way only to look upon my Lord Bruncker) to give Mrs. Williams an
account of her matters, and so hired an ill-favoured horse, and away to
Greenwich to my lodgings, where I hear how rude the souldiers have been
in my absence, swearing what they would do with me, which troubled me,
but, however, after eating a bit I to the office and there very late
writing letters, and so home and to bed.
