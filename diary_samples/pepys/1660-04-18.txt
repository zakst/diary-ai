18th. This morning very early came Mr. Edward Montagu on board, but what
was the business of his coming again or before without any servant
and making no stay at all I cannot guess. This day Sir R. Stayner, Mr.
Sheply, and as many of my Lord’s people as could be spared went to Dover
to get things ready against to-morrow for the election there. I all
the afternoon dictating in my cabin (my own head being troubled with
multiplicity of business) to Burr, who wrote for me above a dozen
letters, by which I have made my mind more light and clear than I have
had it yet since I came on board. At night sent a packet to London, and
Mr. Cook returned hence bringing me this news, that the Sectaries do
talk high what they will do, but I believe all to no purpose, but the
Cavaliers are something unwise to talk so high on the other side as they
do. That the Lords do meet every day at my Lord of Manchester’s, and
resolve to sit the first day of the Parliament. That it is evident now
that the General and the Council do resolve to make way for the King’s
coming. And it is now clear that either the Fanatiques must now be
undone, or the gentry and citizens throughout England, and clergy must
fall, in spite of their militia and army, which is not at all possible
I think. At night I supped with W. Howe and Mr. Luellin (being the first
time that I had been so long with him) in the great cabin below. After
that to bed, and W. Howe sat by my bedside, and he and I sang a psalm or
two and so I to sleep.
