4th (Lord’s day). Lay long talking with my wife, then Mr. Holliard came
to me and let me blood, about sixteen ounces, I being exceedingly full
of blood and very good. I begun to be sick; but lying upon my back I
was presently well again, and did give him 5s. for his pains, and so
we parted, and I, to my chamber to write down my journall from the
beginning of my late journey to this house. Dined well, and after
dinner, my arm tied up with a black ribbon, I walked with my wife to my
brother Tom’s; our boy waiting on us with his sword, which this day
he begins to wear, to outdo Sir W. Pen’s boy, who this day, and Six W.
Batten’s too, begin to wear new livery; but I do take mine to be the
neatest of them all. I led my wife to Mrs. Turner’s pew, and the church
being full, it being to hear a Doctor who is to preach a probacon
sermon, I went out to the Temple and there walked, and so when church
was done went to Mrs. Turner’s, and after a stay there, my wife and I
walked to Grays Inn, to observe fashions of the ladies, because of my
wife’s making some clothes. Thence homewards, and called in at Antony
Joyce’s, where we found his wife brought home sick from church, and was
in a convulsion fit. So home and to Sir W. Pen’s and there supped, and
so to prayers at home and to bed.
