30th. Up, and Mr. Madden come to speak with me, whom my people not
knowing have made to wait long without doors, which vexed me. Then comes
Sir John Winter to discourse with me about the forest of Deane, and then
about my Lord Treasurer, and asking me whether, as he had heard, I had
not been cut for the stone, I took him to my closet, and there shewed
it to him, of which he took the dimensions and had some discourse of
it, and I believe will shew my Lord Treasurer it. Thence to the office,
where we sat all the morning, but little to do, and then to the ‘Change,
where for certain I hear, and the News book declares, a peace between
France and Portugal. Met here with Mr. Pierce, and he tells me the Duke
of Cambridge is very ill and full of spots about his body, that Dr.
Frazier knows not what to think of it. Then home and to dinner, and then
to the office, where all the afternoon; we met about Sir W. Warren’s
business and accounts, wherein I do rather oppose than forward him, but
not in declared terms, for I will not be at, enmity with him, but I will
not have him find any friendship so good as mine. By and by rose and by
water to White Hall, and then called my wife at Unthanke’s. So home and
to my chamber, to my accounts, and finished them to my heart’s wishes
and admiration, they being grown very intricate, being let alone for
two months, but I brought them together all naturally, within a few
shillings, but to my sorrow the Poll money I paid this month and
mourning have made me L80 a worse man than at my last balance, so that I
am worth now but L6700, which is yet an infinite mercy to me, for which
God make me thankful. So late to supper, with a glad heart for the
evening of my accounts so well, and so to bed.
