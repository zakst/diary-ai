1664-65, pp. 526, 527).  Medals were struck in Holland, the
     inscription in Dutch on one of these is thus translated: “Thus we
     arrest the pride of the English, who extend their piracy even
     against their friends, and who insulting the forts of Norway,
     violate the rights of the harbours of King Frederick; but, for the
     reward of their audacity, see their vessels destroyed by the balls
     of the Dutch” (Hawkins’s “Medallic Illustrations of the History of
     Great Britain and Ireland,” ed.  Franks and Grueber, 1885, vol. i.,
     p. 508).  Sir Gilbert Talbot’s “True Narrative of the Earl of
     Sandwich’s Attempt upon Bergen with the English Fleet on the 3rd of
     August, 1665, and the Cause of his Miscarriage thereupon,” is in the
     British Museum (Harl. MS., No. 6859).  It is printed in
     “Archaeologia,” vol.  xxii., p. 33.  The Earl of Rochester also gave
     an account of the action in a letter to his mother (Wordsworth’s
     “Ecclesiastical Biography,” fourth edition, vol. iv., p. 611).  Sir
     John Denham, in his “Advice to a Painter,” gives a long satirical
     account of the affair.  A coloured drawing of the attack upon
     Bergen, on vellum, showing the range of the ships engaged, is in the
     British Museum.  Shortly after the Bergen affair forty of the Dutch
     merchant vessels, on their way to Holland, fell into the hands of
     the English, and in Penn’s “Memorials of Sir William Penn,” vol.
     ii., p. 364, is a list of the prizes taken on the 3rd and 4th
     September.  The troubles connected with these prizes and the
     disgrace into which Lord Sandwich fell are fully set forth in
     subsequent pages of the Diary.  Evelyn writes in his Diary (November
