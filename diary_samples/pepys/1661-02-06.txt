6th. Called up by my Cozen Snow, who sat by me while I was trimmed, and
then I drank with him, he desiring a courtesy for a friend, which I have
done for him. Then to the office, and there sat long, then to dinner,
Captain Murford with me. I had a dish of fish and a good hare, which
was sent me the other day by Goodenough the plasterer. So to the office
again, where Sir W. Pen and I sat all alone, answering of petitions and
nothing else, and so to Sir W. Battenâ€™s, where comes Mr. Jessop (one
whom I could not formerly have looked upon, and now he comes cap in hand
to us from the Commissioners of the Navy, though indeed he is a man of
a great estate and of good report), about some business from them to
us, which we answered by letter. Here I sat long with Sir W., who is not
well, and then home and to my chamber, and some little, music, and so to
bed.
