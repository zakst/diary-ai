3rd (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and busy all the morning, getting rooms and dinner
ready for my guests, which were my uncle and aunt Wight, and two of
their cousins, and an old woman, and Mr. Mills and his wife; and a
good dinner, and all our plate out, and mighty fine and merry, only I
a little vexed at burning a new table-cloth myself, with one of my
trencher-salts. Dinner done, I out with W. Hewer and Mr. Spong, who by
accident come to dine with me, and good talk with him: to White Hall by
coach, and there left him, and I with my Lord Brouncker to attend the
Duke of York, and then up and down the House till the evening, hearing
how the King do intend this frosty weather, it being this day the first,
and very hard frost, that hath come this year, and very cold it is. So
home; and to supper and read; and there my wife and I treating about
coming to an allowance to my wife for clothes; and there I, out of my
natural backwardness, did hang off, which vexed her, and did occasion
some discontented talk in bed, when we went to bed; and also in the
morning, but I did recover all in the morning.
