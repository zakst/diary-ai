3rd (Lord’s day). Up, and with my wife to church, and thither comes
Roger Pepys to our pew, and thence home to dinner, whither comes by
invitation Mr. Turner, the minister, and my cozen Roger brought with him
Jeffrys, the apothecary at Westminster, who is our kinsman, and we had
much discourse of Cottenhamshire, and other things with great pleasure.
My cozen Roger did tell me of a bargain which I may now have in
Norfolke, that my she-cozen, Nan Pepys, is going to sell, the title
whereof is very good, and the pennyworth is also good enough; but it is
out of the way so of my life, that I shall never enjoy it, nor, it may
be, see it, and so I shall have nothing to do with it. After dinner to
talk, and I find by discourse Mr. Turner to be a man mighty well read in
the Roman history, which is very pleasant. By and by Roger went, and
Mr. Turner spent an hour talking over my Lord Sandwich’s condition as
to this Parliament, which we fear may be bad, and the condition of
his family, which can be no better, and then having little to comfort
ourselves but that this humour will not last always in the Parliament,
and that [it] may well have a great many more as great men as he
enquired into, and so we parted, and I to my chamber, and there busy all
the evening, and then my wife and I to supper, and so to bed, with much
discourse and pleasure one with another.
