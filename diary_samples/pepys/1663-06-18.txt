18th. Up by four o’clock and to my office, where all the morning writing
out in my Navy collections the ordinary estimate of the Navy, and did it
neatly. Then dined at home alone, my mind pleased with business, but sad
for the absence of my wife. After dinner half an hour at my viallin, and
then all the afternoon sitting at the office late, and so home and to
bed. This morning Mr. Cutler came and sat in my closet half an hour with
me, his discourse very excellent, being a wise man, and I do perceive by
him as well as many others that my diligence is taken notice of in the
world, for which I bless God and hope to continue doing so. Before I
went into my house this night I called at Sir W. Batten’s, where finding
some great ladies at table at supper with him and his lady, I retreated
and went home, though they called to me again and again, and afterwards
sent for me. So I went, and who should it be but Sir Fr. Clerke and his
lady and another proper lady at supper there, and great cheer, where I
staid till 11 o’clock at night, and so home and to bed.
