where the news is strong that not only the Dutch cannot set out a fleete
this year, but that the French will not, and that he hath given the
answer to the Dutch Embassador, saying that he is for the King of
England’s, having an honourable peace, which, if true, is the best
news we have had a good while. At the office all the morning, and there
pleased with the little pretty Deptford woman I have wished for long,
and she hath occasion given her to come again to me. After office I to
the ‘Change a little, and then home and to dinner, and then by coach
with my wife to the Duke of York’s house, and there saw “The Wits,” a
play I formerly loved, and is now corrected and enlarged: but, though I
like the acting, yet I like not much in the play now. The Duke of York
and [Sir] W. Coventry gone to Portsmouth, makes me thus to go to
plays. So home, and to the office a little and then home, where I find
Goodgroome, and he and I did sing several things over, and tried two or
three grace parts in Playford’s new book, my wife pleasing me in singing
her part of the things she knew, which is a comfort to my very heart. So
he being gone we to supper and to bed.
