2nd (Lord’s day). Up, and by water to White Hall, and there visit my
Lord Sandwich, who, after about two months’ absence at Hinchingbroke,
come to town last night. I saw him, and very kind; and I am glad he is
so, I having not wrote to him all the time, my eyes indeed not letting
me. Here with Sir Charles Herbert [Harbord], and my Lord Hinchingbroke,
and Sidney, we looked upon the picture of Tangier, designed: by Charles
Herbert [Harbord], and drawn by Dancre, which my Lord Sandwich admires,
as being the truest picture that ever he’s saw in his life: and it is
indeed very pretty, and I will be at the cost of having one of them.
Thence with them to White Hall, and there walked out the sermon, with
one or other; and then saw the Duke of York after sermon, and he talked
to me a little; and so away back by water home, and after dinner got my
wife to read, and then by coach, she and I, to the Park, and there spent
the evening with much pleasure, it proving clear after a little shower,
and we mighty fine as yesterday, and people mightily pleased with our
coach, as I perceived; but I had not on my fine suit, being really
afeard to wear it, it being so fine with the gold lace, though not gay.
So home and to supper, and my wife to read, and Tom, my Nepotisme, and
then to bed.
