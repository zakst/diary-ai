31st. Up betimes and walked to my Lord Ashly, and there with Creed after
long waiting spoke with him, and was civilly used by him; thence to
Sir Ph. Warwicke, and then to visit my Lord of Falmouth, who did also
receive me pretty civilly, but not as I expected; he, I perceive,
believing that I had undertaken to justify Povy’s accounts, taking them
upon myself, but I rectified him therein. So to my Lady Sandwich’s to
dinner, and up to her chamber after dinner, and there discoursed
about Sir G. Carteret’s son, in proposition between us two for my Lady
Jemimah. So to Povy, and with him spent the afternoon very busy, till I
was weary of following this and neglecting my navy business. So at night
called my wife at my Lady’s, and so home. To my office and there made up
my month’s account, which, God be praised! rose to L1300. Which I bless
God for. So after 12 o’clock home to supper and to bed. I find Creed
mightily transported by my Lord of Falmouth’s kind words to him, and
saying that he hath a place in his intention for him, which he believes
will be considerable. A witty man he is in every respect, but of no good
nature, nor a man ordinarily to be dealt with. My Lady Castlemayne is
sicke again, people think, slipping her filly.
