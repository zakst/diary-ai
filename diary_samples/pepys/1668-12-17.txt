come to me to dinner, who did, and pretty pleased with their talk of
Spayne; but my wife did not come down, I suppose because she would
not, Captain Ferrers being there, to oblige me by it. They gone, after
dinner, I to the office, and then in the evening home, being the last
day of the year, to endeavour to pay all bills and servants’ wages, &c.,
which I did almost to L5 that I know that I owe in the world, but to the
publique; and so with great pleasure to supper and to bed, and, blessed
be God! the year ends, after some late very great sorrow with my wife
by my folly, yet ends, I say, with great mutual peace and content, and
likely to last so by my care, who am resolved to enjoy the sweet of
it, which I now possess, by never giving her like cause of trouble. My
greatest trouble is now from the backwardness of my accounts, which I
have not seen the bottom of now near these two years, so that I know not
in what condition I am in the world, but by the grace of God, as far as
my eyes will give me leave, I will do it.
