August 1st. Slept, and lay long; then up and my Lord [Crew] and Sir G.
Carteret being gone abroad, I first to see the bridegroom and bride, and
found them both up, and he gone to dress himself. Both red in the face,
and well enough pleased this morning with their night’s lodging. Thence
down and Mr. Brisband and I to billiards: anon come my Lord and Sir G.
Carteret in, who have been looking abroad and visiting some farms that
Sir G. Carteret hath thereabouts, and, among other things, report the
greatest stories of the bigness of the calfes they find there, ready to
sell to the butchers, as big, they say, as little Cowes, and that they
do give them a piece of chalke to licke, which they hold makes them
white in the flesh within. Very merry at dinner, and so to talk and
laugh after dinner, and up and down, some to [one] place, some to
another, full of content on all sides. Anon about five o’clock, Sir
G. Carteret and his lady and I took coach with the greatest joy and
kindnesse that could be from the two familys or that ever I saw with
so much appearance, and, I believe, reality in all my life. Drove
hard home, and it was night ere we got to Deptford, where, with much
kindnesse from them to me, I left them, and home to the office, where I
find all well, and being weary and sleepy, it being very late, I to bed.
