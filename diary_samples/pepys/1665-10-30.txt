30th. Up, and to my office about business. At noon to dinner, and after
some discourse of musique, he and I to the office awhile, and he to get
Mr. Coleman, if he can, against night. By and by I back again home, and
there find him returned with Mr. Coleman (his wife being ill) and Mr.
Laneare, with whom with their Lute we had excellent company and good
singing till midnight, and a good supper I did give them, but Colemanâ€™s
voice is quite spoiled, and when he begins to be drunk he is excellent
company, but afterward troublesome and impertinent. Laneare sings in a
melancholy method very well, and a sober man he seems to be. They being
gone, we to bed. Captain Ferrers coming this day from my Lord is forced
to lodge here, and I put him to Mr. Hill.
