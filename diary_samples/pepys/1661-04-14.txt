14th (Easter. Lord’s day). In the morning towards my father’s, and by
the way heard Mr. Jacomb, at Ludgate, upon these words, “Christ loved
you and therefore let us love one another,” and made a lazy sermon, like
a Presbyterian. Then to my father’s and dined there, and Dr. Fairbrother
(lately come to town) with us. After dinner I went to the Temple and
there heard Dr. Griffith, a good sermon for the day; so with Mr. Moore
(whom I met there) to my Lord’s, and there he shewed me a copy of my
Lord Chancellor’s patent for Earl, and I read the preamble, which is
very short, modest, and good. Here my Lord saw us and spoke to me about
getting Mr. Moore to come and govern his house while he goes to sea,
which I promised him to do and did afterwards speak to Mr. Moore, and
he is willing. Then hearing that Mr. Barnwell was come, with some of my
Lord’s little children, yesterday to town, to see the Coronacion, I went
and found them at the Goat, at Charing Cross, and there I went and drank
with them a good while, whom I found in very good health and very merry
Then to my father’s, and after supper seemed willing to go home, and
my wife seeming to be so too I went away in a discontent, but she, poor
wretch, followed me as far in the rain and dark as Fleet Bridge to fetch
me back again, and so I did, and lay with her to-night, which I have not
done these eight or ten days before.
