17th (Lord’s day). Up, and before I went out of my chamber did draw a
musique scale, in order to my having it at any time ready in my hand
to turn to for exercise, for I have a great mind in this Vacation to
perfect myself in my scale, in order to my practising of composition,
and so that being done I down stairs, and there find Captain Cocke under
the barber’s hands, the barber that did heretofore trim Commissioner
Pett, and with whom I have been. He offered to come this day after
dinner with his violin to play me a set of Lyra-ayres upon it, which I
was glad of, hoping to be merry thereby. Being ready we to church, where
a company of fine people to church, and a fine Church, and very good
sermon, Mr. Plume’ being a very excellent scholler and preacher. Coming
out of the church I met Mrs. Pierce, whom I was ashamed to see, having
not been with her since my coming to town, but promised to visit her.
Thence with Captain Cocke, in his coach, home to dinner, whither comes
by invitation my Lord Bruncker and his mistresse and very good company
we were, but in dinner time comes Sir J. Minnes from the fleete, like a
simple weak man, having nothing to say of what he hath done there,
but tells of what value he imagines the prizes to be, and that my Lord
Sandwich is well, and mightily concerned to hear that I was well. But
this did put me upon a desire of going thither; and, moving of it to
my Lord, we presently agreed upon it to go this very tide, we two and
Captain Cocke. So every body prepared to fit himself for his journey,
and I walked to Woolwich to trim and shift myself, and by the time I was
ready they come down in the Bezan yacht, and so I aboard and my boy Tom,
and there very merrily we sailed to below Gravesend, and there come to
anchor for all night, and supped and talked, and with much pleasure at
last settled ourselves to sleep having very good lodging upon cushions
in the cabbin.
