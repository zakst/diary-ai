27th. This morning, both Sir Williams and I by barge to Deptford-yard
to give orders in businesses there; and called on several ships, also
to give orders, and so to Woolwich, and there dined at Mr. Falconerâ€™s
of victuals we carried ourselves, and one Mr. Dekins, the father of my
Morena, of whom we have lately bought some hemp. That being done we went
home again. This morning, going to take water upon Tower-hill, we met
with three sleddes standing there to carry my Lord Monson and Sir H.
Mildmay and another, to the gallows and back again, with ropes about
their necks; which is to be repeated every year, this being the day of
their sentencing the King.
