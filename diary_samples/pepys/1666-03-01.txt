March 1st. Up, and to the office and there all the morning sitting and
at noon to dinner with my Lord Bruncker, Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen
at the White Horse in Lumbard Streete, where, God forgive us! good sport
with Captain Cockeâ€™s having his mayde sicke of the plague a day or two
ago and sent to the pest house, where she now is, but he will not say
anything but that she is well. But blessed be God! a good Bill this week
we have; being but 237 in all, and 42 of the plague, and of them but six
in the City: though my Lord Bruneker says, that these six are most of
them in new parishes where they were not the last week. Here was with
us also Mr. Williamson, who the more I know, the more I honour. Hence I
slipt after dinner without notice home and there close to my business at
my office till twelve at night, having with great comfort returned to my
business by some fresh vowes in addition to my former, and-more severe,
and a great joy it is to me to see myself in a good disposition to
business. So home to supper and to my Journall and to bed.
