23rd (Coronation day). Up, and after doing something at my office, and,
it being a holiday, no sitting likely to be, I down by water to Sir
W. Warren’s, who hath been ill, and there talked long with him good
discourse, especially about Sir W. Batten’s knavery and his son Castle’s
ill language of me behind my back, saying that I favour my fellow
traytours, but I shall be even with him. So home and to the ‘Change,
where I met with Mr. Coventry, who himself is now full of talke of a
Dutch warr; for it seems the Lords have concurred in the Commons’
vote about it; and so the next week it will be presented to the King,
insomuch that he do desire we would look about to see what stores we
lack, and buy what we can. Home to dinner, where I and my wife much
troubled about my money that is in my Lord Sandwich’s hand, for fear of
his going to sea and be killed; but I will get what of it out I can.
All the afternoon, not being well, at my office, and there doing much
business, my thoughts still running upon a warr and my money. At night
home to supper and to bed.
