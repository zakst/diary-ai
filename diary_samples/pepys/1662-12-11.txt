11th. Up, it being a great frost upon the snow, and we sat all the
morning upon Mr. Creedâ€™s accounts, wherein I did him some service and
some disservice. At noon he dined with me, and we sat all the afternoon
together, discoursing of ways to get money, which I am now giving
myself wholly up to, and in the evening he went away and I to my office,
concluding all matters concerning our great letter so long in doing to
my Lord Treasurer, till almost one in the morning, and then home with my
mind much eased, and so to bed.
