24th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon rose
and to my closet, and finished my report to my Lord Treasurer of our
Tangier wants, and then with Sir J. Minnes by coach to Stepney to the
Trinity House, where it is kept again now since the burning of their
other house in London. And here a great many met at Sir Thomas Allen’s
feast, of his being made an Elder Brother; but he is sick, and so
could not be there. Here was much good company, and very merry; but the
discourse of Scotland, it seems, is confirmed, and that they are 4000 of
them in armes, and do declare for King and Covenant, which is very ill
news. I pray God deliver us from the ill consequences we may justly fear
from it. Here was a good venison pasty or two and other good victuals;
but towards the latter end of the dinner I rose, and without taking
leave went away from the table, and got Sir J. Minnes’ coach and away
home, and thence with my report to my Lord Treasurer’s, where I did
deliver it to Sir Philip Warwicke for my Lord, who was busy, my report
for him to consider against to-morrow’s council. Sir Philip Warwicke, I
find, is full of trouble in his mind to see how things go, and what
our wants are; and so I have no delight to trouble him with discourse,
though I honour the man with all my heart, and I think him to be a very
able and right honest man. So away home again, and there to my office
to write my letters very late, and then home to supper, and then to read
the late printed discourse of witches by a member of Gresham College,
and then to bed; the discourse being well writ, in good stile, but
methinks not very convincing. This day Mr. Martin is come to tell me his
wife is brought to bed of a girle, and I promised to christen it next
Sunday.
