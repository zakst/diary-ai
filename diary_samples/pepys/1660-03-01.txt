March 1st. In the morning went to my Lord’s lodgings, thinking to have
spoke with Mr. Sheply, having not been to visit him since my coming to
town. But he being not within I went up, and out of the box where my
Lord’s pamphlets lay, I chose as many as I had a mind to have for my own
use and left the rest. Then to my office, where little to do, abut
Mr. Sheply comes to me, so at dinner time he and I went to Mr. Crew’s,
whither Mr. Thomas was newly come to town, being sent with Sir H.
Yelverton, a my old school-fellow at Paul’s School, to bring the thanks
of the county to General Monk for the return of the Parliament. But old
Mr. Crew and my Lord not coming home to dinner, we tarried late before
we went to dinner, it being the day that John, Mr. John Crew’s coachman,
was to be buried in the afternoon, he being a day or two before killed
with a blow of one of his horses that struck his skull into his brain.
From thence Mr. Sheply and I went into London to Mr. Laxton’s; my Lord’s
apothecary, and so by water to Westminster, where at the Sun [tavern] he
and I spent two or three hours in a pint or two of wine, discoursing of
matters in the country, among other things telling me that my uncle
did to him make a very kind mention of me, and what he would do for me.
Thence I went home, and went to bed betimes. This day the Parliament did
vote that they would not sit longer than the 15th day of this month.
