16th. Up and dispatched things into the country and to my father’s, and
two keggs of Sturgeon and a dozen bottles of wine to Cambridge for my
cozen Roger Pepys, which I give him. By and by down by water on
several Deall ships, and stood upon a stage in one place seeing calkers
sheathing of a ship. Then at Wapping to my carver’s about my Viall head.
So home, and thence to my Viall maker’s in Bishops, gate Street; his
name is Wise, who is a pretty fellow at it. Thence to the Exchange, and
so home to dinner, and then to my office, where a full board, and busy
all the afternoon, and among other things made a great contract with Sir
W. Warren for 40,000 deals Swinsound, at L3 17s. od. per hundred. In
the morning before I went on the water I was at Thames Street about some
pitch, and there meeting Anthony Joyce, I took him and Mr. Stacy, the
Tarr merchant, to the tavern, where Stacy told me many old stories of my
Lady Batten’s former poor condition, and how her former husband broke,
and how she came to her state. At night, after office done, I went
to Sir W. Batten’s, where my Lady and I [had] some high words about
emptying our house of office, where I did tell her my mind, and at last
agreed that it should be done through my office, and so all well. So
home to bed.
