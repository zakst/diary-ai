18th (Lord’s day). In the morning to our own church, Where Mr. Powel (a
crook legged man that went formerly with me to Paul’s School), preached
a good sermon. In the afternoon to our own church and my wife with me
(the first time that she and my Lady Batten came to sit in our new pew),
and after sermon my Lady took us home and there we supped with her and
Sir W. Batten, and Pen, and were much made of. The first time that ever
my wife was there. So home and to bed.
