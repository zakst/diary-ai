20th (Lord’s day). Up, and with my wife to church, where Pegg Pen very
fine in her new coloured silk suit laced with silver lace. Dined at
home, and Mr. Sheply, lately come to town, with me. A great deal of
ordinary discourse with him. Among other things praying him to speak
to Stankes to look after our business. With him and in private with Mr.
Bodham talking of our ropeyarde stores at Woolwich, which are mighty
low, even to admiration. They gone, in the evening comes Mr. Andrews and
sings with us, and he gone, I to Sir W. Batten’s, where Sir J. Minnes
and he and I to talk about our letter to my Lord Treasurer, where his
folly and simple confidence so great in a report so ridiculous that he
hath drawn up to present to my Lord, nothing of it being true, that I
was ashamed, and did roundly and in many words for an houre together
talk boldly to him, which pleased Sir W. Batten and my Lady, but I was
in the right, and was the willinger to do so before them, that they
might see that I am somebody, and shall serve him so in his way another
time. So home vexed at this night’s passage, for I had been very hot
with him, so to supper and to bed, out of order with this night’s
vexation.
