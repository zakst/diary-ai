27th. In the morning to Alderman Backwell’s again, where I found the
candlesticks done, and went along with him in his coach to my Lord’s and
left the candlesticks with Mr. Shepley. I staid in the garden talking
much with my Lord, who do show me much of his love and do communicate
his mind in most things to me, which is my great content. Home and with
my wife to Sir W. Batten’s to dinner, where much and good company. My
wife not very well went home, I staid late there seeing them play at
cards, and so home to bed. This afternoon there came in a strange lord
to Sir William Batten’s by a mistake and enters discourse with him, so
that we could not be rid of him till Sir Arn. Breames and Mr. Bens and
Sir W. Pen fell a-drinking to him till he was drunk, and so sent him
away. About the middle of the night I was very ill--I think with eating
and drinking too much--and so I was forced to call the maid, who pleased
my wife and I in her running up and down so innocently in her smock,
and vomited in the bason, and so to sleep, and in the morning was pretty
well, only got cold, and so had pain.... as I used to have.
