25th. All the morning about my Lord’s character. Dined to-day with
Captain Clerke on board the Speaker (a very brave ship) where was the
Vice-Admiral, Rear-Admiral, and many other commanders. After dinner
home, not a little contented to see how I am treated, and with what
respect made a fellow to the best commanders in the Fleet. All the
afternoon finishing of the character, which I did and gave it my Lord,
it being very handsomely done and a very good one in itself, but that
not truly Alphabetical. Supped with Mr. Sheply, W. Howe, &c. in Mr.
Pierce, the Purser’s cabin, where very merry, and so to bed. Captain
Isham came hither to-day.
