5th. Up with pain, and with Sir J. Minnes by coach to the Temple, and
then I to my brother’s, and up and down on business, and so to the New
Exchange, and there met Creed, and he and I walked two or three hours,
talking of many businesses, especially about Tangier, and my Lord
Tiviot’s bringing in of high accounts, and yet if they were higher are
like to pass without exception, and then of my Lord Sandwich sending a
messenger to know whether the King intends to come to Newmarket, as is
talked, that he may be ready to entertain him at Hinchingbroke. Thence
home and dined, and my wife all day putting up her hangings in her
closett, which she do very prettily herself with her own hand, to my
great content. So I to the office till night, about several businesses,
and then went and sat an hour or two with Sir W. Pen, talking very
largely of Sir J. Minnes’s simplicity and unsteadiness, and of Sir W.
Batten’s suspicious dealings, wherein I was open, and he sufficiently,
so that I do not care for his telling of tales, for he said as much,
but whether that were so or no I said nothing but what is my certain
knowledge and belief concerning him. Thence home to bed in great pain.
