2nd. Up, and to the office. This day I hear that Prince Rupert is to be
trepanned. God give good issue to it. Sir W. Pen looks upon me, and I on
him, and speak about business together at the table well enough, but no
friendship or intimacy since our late difference about his closet, nor
do I desire to have any. At noon dined well, and my brother and I to
write over once more with my own hand my catalogue of books, while he
reads to me. After something of that done, and dined, I to the office,
where all the afternoon till night busy. At night, having done all my
office matters, I home, and my brother and I to go on with my catalogue,
and so to supper. Mrs. Turner come to me this night again to condole her
condition and the ill usage she receives from my Lord Bruncker, which
I could never have expected from him, and shall be a good caution to me
while I live. She gone, I to supper, and then to read a little, and to
bed. This night comes home my new silver snuffe-dish, which I do give
myself for my closet, which is all I purpose to bestow in plate of
myself, or shall need, many a day, if I can keep what I have. So to bed.
I am very well pleased this night with reading a poem I brought home
with me last night from Westminster Hall, of Dryden’s’ upon the present
war; a very good poem.
