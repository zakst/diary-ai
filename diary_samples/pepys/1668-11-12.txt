12th. Up, and she with me as heretofore, and so I to the Office, where
all the morning, and at noon to dinner, and Mr. Wayth, who, being at
my office about business, I took him with me to talk and understand his
matters, who is in mighty trouble from the Committee of Accounts about
his contracting with this Office for sayle-cloth, but no hurt can be
laid at his door in it, but upon us for doing it, if any, though we did
it by the Duke of York’s approval, and by him I understand that the
new Treasurers do intend to bring in all new Instruments, and so having
dined we parted, and I to my wife and to sit with her a little, and then
called her and Willet to my chamber, and there did, with tears in my
eyes, which I could not help, discharge her and advise her to be gone as
soon as she could, and never to see me, or let me see her more while
she was in the house, which she took with tears too, but I believe
understands me to be her friend, and I am apt to believe by what my wife
hath of late told me is a cunning girle, if not a slut. Thence, parting
kindly with my wife, I away by coach to my cozen Roger, according as by
mistake (which the trouble of my mind for some days has occasioned, in
this and another case a day or two before) is set down in yesterday’s
notes, and so back again, and with Mr. Gibson late at my chamber making
an end of my draught of a letter for the Duke of York, in answer to the
answers of this Office, which I have now done to my mind, so as, if the
Duke likes it, will, I think, put an end to a great deal of the faults
of this Office, as well as my trouble for them. So to bed, and did lie
now a little better than formerly, but with little, and yet with some
trouble.
