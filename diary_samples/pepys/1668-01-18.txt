18th. At the office all the morning busy sitting. At noon home to
dinner, where Betty Turner dined with us, and after dinner carried my
wife, her and Deb. to the ‘Change, where they bought some things, while
I bought “The Mayden Queene,” a play newly printed, which I like at the
King’s house so well, of Mr. Dryden’s, which he himself, in his preface,
seems to brag of, and indeed is a good play. So home again, and I late
at the office and did much business, and then home to supper and to bed.
