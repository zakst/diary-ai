29th. Up, and Mr. Shepley came to me, who is lately come to town; among
other things I hear by him how the children are sent for away from my
father’s, but he says without any great discontent. I am troubled there
should be this occasion of difference, and yet I am glad they are gone,
lest it should have come to worse. He tells me how my brave dogg I did
give him, going out betimes one morning to Huntington, was set upon by
five other doggs, and worried to pieces, of which I am a little, and
he the most sorry I ever saw man for such a thing. Forth with him and
walked a good way talking, then parted and I to the Temple, and to
my cozen Roger Pepys, and thence by water to Westminster to see Dean
Honiwood, whom I had not visited a great while. He is a good-natured,
but a very weak man, yet a Dean, and a man in great esteem. Thence
walked to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there dined, my Lord there. He was
pleasant enough at table with me, but yet without any discourse of
business, or any regard to me when dinner was over, but fell to cards,
and my Lady and I sat two hours alone, talking of the condition of
her family’s being greatly in debt, and many children now coming up to
provide for. I did give her my sense very plain of it, which she took
well and carried further than myself, to the bemoaning their condition,
and remembering how finely things were ordered about six years ago, when
I lived there and my Lord at sea every year. Thence home, doing several
errands by the way. So to my office, and there till late at night, Mr.
Comander coming to me for me to sign and seal the new draft of my will,
which I did do, I having altered something upon the death of my brother
Tom. So home to supper and to bed.
