26th. Up pretty well again, but my mouth very scabby, my cold being
going away, so that I was forced to wear a great black patch, but that
would not do much good, but it happens we did not go to the Duke to-day,
and so I staid at home busy all the morning. At noon, after dinner,
to the â€˜Change, and thence home to my office again, where busy, well
employed till 10 at night, and so home to supper and to bed, my mind
a little troubled that I have not of late kept up myself so briske in
business; but mind my ease a little too much and my family upon the
coming of Mercer and Tom. So that I have not kept company, nor appeared
very active with Mr. Coventry, but now I resolve to settle to it again,
not that I have idled all my time, but as to my ease something. So I
have looked a little too much after Tangier and the Fishery, and that
in the sight of Mr. Coventry, but I have good reason to love myself for
serving Tangier, for it is one of the best flowers in my garden.
