8th. Up pretty early, and sent my boy to the carrier’s with some wine
for my father, for to make his feast among his Brampton friends this
Christmas, and my muff to my mother, sent as from my wife. But before I
sent my boy out with them, I beat him for a lie he told me, at which his
sister, with whom we have of late been highly displeased, and warned her
to be gone, was angry, which vexed me, to see the girl I loved so well,
and my wife, should at last turn so much a fool and unthankful to us.
So to the office, and there all the morning, and though without and
a little against the advice of the officers did, to gratify him, send
Thomas Hater to-day towards Portsmouth a day or two before the rest of
the clerks, against the Pay next week. Dined at home; and there being
the famous new play acted the first time to-day, which is called “The
Adventures of Five Hours,” at the Duke’s house, being, they say, made or
translated by Colonel Tuke, I did long to see it; and so made my wife to
get her ready, though we were forced to send for a smith, to break open
her trunk, her mayde Jane being gone forth with the keys, and so we
went; and though early, were forced to sit almost out of sight, at the
end of one of the lower forms, so full was the house. And the play,
in one word, is the best, for the variety and the most excellent
continuance of the plot to the very end, that ever I saw, or think ever
shall, and all possible, not only to be done in the time, but in most
other respects very admittable, and without one word of ribaldry;
and the house, by its frequent plaudits, did show their sufficient
approbation. So home; with much ado in an hour getting a coach home,
and, after writing letters at my office, I went home to supper and to
bed, now resolving to set up my rest as to plays till Easter, if not
Whitsuntide next, excepting plays at Court.
