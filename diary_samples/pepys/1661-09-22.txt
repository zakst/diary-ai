22nd (Lordâ€™s day). Before church time walking with my father in the
garden contriving. So to church, where we had common prayer, and a dull
sermon by one Mr. Case, who yet I heard sing very well. So to dinner,
and busy with my father about his accounts all the afternoon, and people
came to speak with us about business. Mr. Barnwell at night came and
supped with us. So after setting matters even with my father and I, to
bed.
