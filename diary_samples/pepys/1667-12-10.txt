10th. Up, and all the morning at the office, and then home with my
people to dinner, and very merry, and then to my office again, where did
much business till night, that my eyes begun to be sore, and then forced
to leave off, and by coach set my wife at her tailorâ€™s and Willet, and I
to Westminster Hall, and there walked a good while till 8 at night, and
there hear to my great content that the King did send a message to
the House to-day that he would adjourne them on the 17th instant to
February; by which time, at least, I shall have more respite to prepare
things on my own behalf, and the Office, against their return. Here met
Mr. Hinxton, the organist, walking, and I walked with him; and, asking
him many questions, I do find that he can no more give an intelligible
answer to a man that is not a great master in his art, than another man.
And this confirms me that it is only want of an ingenious man that
is master in musique, to bring musique to a certainty, and ease in
composition. Having done this, I home, taking up my wife and girle, and
there to supper and to bed, having finished my letters, among which one
to Commissioner Middleton, who is now coming up to town from Portsmouth,
to enter upon his Surveyorship.
