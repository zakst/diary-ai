13th. Lay till 6 o’clock and then up, and after a little talk and mirth,
he went away, and I to my office, where busy all the morning, and at
noon home to dinner, and after dinner Pembleton came and I practised.
But, Lord! to see how my wife will not be thought to need telling by me
or Ashwell, and yet will plead that she has learnt but a month, which
causes many short fallings out between us. So to my office, whither
one-eyed Cooper came to see me, and I made him to show me the use of
platts, and to understand the lines, and how to find how lands bear,
&c., to my great content. Then came Mr. Barrow, storekeeper of Chatham,
who tells me many things, how basely Sir W. Batten has carried himself
to him, and in all things else like a passionate dotard, to the King’s
great wrong. God mend all, for I am sure we are but in an ill condition
in the Navy, however the King is served in other places. Home to supper,
to cards, and to bed.
