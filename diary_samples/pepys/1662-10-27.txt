27th. Up, and while I am dressing I sent for my boy’s brother, William,
that lives in town here as a groom, to whom and their sister Jane I told
my resolution to keep the boy no longer. So upon the whole they desire
to have him stay a week longer, and then he shall go. So to the office,
and there Mr. Coventry and I sat till noon, and then I stept to the
Exchange, and so home to dinner, and after dinner with my wife to the
Duke’s Theatre, and saw the second part of “Rhodes,” done with the new
Roxalana; which do it rather better in all respects for person, voice,
and judgment, then the first Roxalana. Home with great content with my
wife, not so well pleased with the company at the house to-day, which
was full of citizens, there hardly being a gentleman or woman in the
house; a couple of pretty ladies by us that made sport in it, being
jostled and crowded by prentices. So home, and I to my study making up
my monthly accounts, which is now fallen again to L630 or thereabouts,
which not long since was L680, at which I am sorry, but I trust in God I
shall get it up again, and in the meantime will live sparingly. So home
to supper and to bed.
