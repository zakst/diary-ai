19th (Lord’s day). Up, and after being trimmed, alone by water to Erith,
all the way with my song book singing of Mr. Lawes’s long recitative
song in the beginning of his book. Being come there, on board my Lord
Bruncker, I find Captain Cocke and other company, the lady not well,
and mighty merry we were; Sir Edmund Pooly being very merry, and a right
English gentleman, and one of the discontented Cavaliers, that think
their loyalty is not considered. After dinner, all on shore to my Lady
Williams, and there drank and talked; but, Lord! the most impertinent
bold woman with my Lord that ever I did see. I did give her an account
again of my business with my Lord touching W. Howe, and she did give me
some more information about it, and examination taken about it, and so
we parted and I took boat, and to Woolwich, where we found my wife not
well of them, and I out of humour begun to dislike her paynting, the
last things not pleasing me so well as the former, but I blame myself
for my being so little complaisant. So without eating or drinking,
there being no wine (which vexed me too), we walked with a lanthorne to
Greenwich and eat something at his house, and so home to bed.
