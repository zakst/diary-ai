15th. To Westminster; and at the Privy Seal I saw Mr. Coventry’s seal
for his being Commissioner with us, at which I know not yet whether to
be glad or otherwise. So doing several things by the way, I walked home,
and after dinner to the office all the afternoon. At night, all the
bells of the town rung, and bonfires made for the joy of the Queen’s
arrival, who came and landed at Portsmouth last night. But I do not see
much thorough joy, but only an indifferent one, in the hearts of people,
who are much discontented at the pride and luxury of the Court, and
running in debt.
