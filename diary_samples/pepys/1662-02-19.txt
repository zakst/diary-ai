19th. Musique practice: thence to the Trinity House to conclude upon our
report of Sir N. Crispâ€™s project, who came to us to answer objections,
but we did give him no ear, but are resolved to stand to our report;
though I could wish we had shewn him more justice and had heard him.
Thence to the Wardrobe and dined with my Lady, and talked after dinner
as I used to do, and so home and up to my chamber to put things in order
to my good content, and so to musique practice.
