17th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning sitting, and at noon
home to dinner, and to the office all the afternoon, and then late home,
and there with much pleasure getting Mr. Gibbs, that writes well, to
write the name upon my new draught of “The Resolution;” and so set it
up, and altered the situation of some of my pictures in my closet, to
my extraordinary content, and at it with much pleasure till almost 12
at night. Mr. Moore and Seymour were with me this afternoon, who tell me
that my Lord Sandwich was received mighty kindly by the King, and is in
exceeding great esteem with him, and the rest about him; but I doubt it
will be hard for him to please both the King and the Duke of York, which
I shall be sorry for. Mr. Moore tells me the sad condition my Lord is
in, in his estate and debts; and the way he now lives in, so high, and
so many vain servants about him, that he must be ruined, if he do not
take up, which, by the grace of God, I will put him upon, when I come to
see him.
