September 2nd, 1651.  “A great many younger brothers and reformed
     officers of the King’s army depended upon him for their meat and
     drink.”  So reformado, a discharged or disbanded officer.--M. B.]

two of them, be sure let him command the troop that is left.” Thence
home, and there came presently to me Mr. Young and Whistler, who find
that I have quite overcome them in their business of flags, and now they
come to intreat my favour, but I will be even with them. So late to
my office and there till past one in the morning making up my month’s
accounts, and find that my expense this month in clothes has kept me
from laying up anything; but I am no worse, but a little better than I
was, which is L1205, a great sum, the Lord be praised for it! So home
to bed, with my mind full of content therein, and vexed for my being so
angry in bad words to my wife to-night, she not giving me a good account
of her layings out to my mind to-night. This day I hear young Mr.
Stanly, a brave young [gentleman], that went out with young Jermin,
with Prince Rupert, is already dead of the small-pox, at Portsmouth. All
preparations against the Dutch; and the Duke of Yorke fitting himself
with all speed, to go to the fleete which is hastening for him; being
now resolved to go in the Charles.
