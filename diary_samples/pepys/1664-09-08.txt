8th. Up and to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon dined at
home, and I by water down to Woolwich by a galley, and back again in the
evening. All haste made in setting out this Guinny fleete, but yet not
such as will ever do the King’s business if we come to a warr. My wife
this afternoon being very well dressed by her new woman, Mary Mercer,
a decayed merchant’s daughter that our Will helps us to, did go to the
christening of Mrs. Mills, the parson’s wife’s child, where she never
was before. After I was come home Mr. Povey came to me and took me out
to supper to Mr. Bland’s, who is making now all haste to be gone for
Tangier. Here pretty merry, and good discourse, fain to admire the
knowledge and experience of Mrs. Bland, who I think as good a merchant
as her husband. I went home and there find Mercer, whose person I like
well, and I think will do well, at least I hope so. So to my office a
while and then to bed.
