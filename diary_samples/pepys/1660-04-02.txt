2d. Up very early, and to get all my things and my boyâ€™s packed up.
Great concourse of commanders here this morning to take leave of my Lord
upon his going into the Nazeby, so that the table was full, so there
dined below many commanders, and Mr. Creed, who was much troubled to
hear that he could not go along with my Lord, for he had already got all
his things thither, thinking to stay there, but W. Howe was very high
against it, and he indeed did put him out, though everybody was glad of
it. After dinner I went in one of the boats with my boy before my Lord,
and made shift before night to get my cabin in pretty good order. It
is but little, but very convenient, having one window to the sea
and another to the deck, and a good bed. This morning comes Mr. Ed.
Pickering, like a coxcomb as he always was. He tells me that the King
will come in, but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself,
or else to hinder it.
