31st Office day. Much troubled all this morning in my mind about the
business of my walk on the leads. I spoke of it to the Comptroller and
the rest of the principal officers, who are all unwilling to meddle in
anything that may anger my Lady Davis. And so I am fain to give over for
the time that she do continue therein. Dined at home, and after dinner
to Westminster Hall, where I met with Billing the quaker at Mrs.
Michell’s shop, who is still of the former opinion he was of against the
clergymen of all sorts, and a cunning fellow I find him to be. Home, and
there I had news that Sir W. Pen is resolved to ride to Sir W. Batten’s
country house to-morrow, and would have me go with him, so I sat up
late, getting together my things to ride in, and was fain to cut an old
pair of boots to make leathers for those I was to wear. This month I
conclude with my mind very heavy for the loss of the leads, as also for
the greatness of my late expenses, insomuch that I do not think that I
have above L150 clear money in the world, but I have, I believe, got
a great deal of good household stuff: I hear to-day that the Queen is
landed at Dover, and will be here on Friday next, November 2nd. My wife
has been so ill of late of her old pain that I have not known her this
fortnight almost, which is a pain to me.
