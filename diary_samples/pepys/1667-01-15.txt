15th. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning. Here my Lord
Bruncker would have made me promise to go with him to a play this
afternoon, where Knipp acts Mrs. Weaver’s great part in “The Indian
Emperour,” and he says is coming on to be a great actor. But I am so
fell to my business, that I, though against my inclination, will not go.
At noon, dined with my wife and were pleasant, and then to the
office, where I got Mrs. Burroughs ‘sola cum ego, and did toucher ses
mamailles’... She gone, I to my business and did much, and among other
things to-night we were all mightily troubled how to prevent the sale of
a great deal of hemp, and timber-deals, and other good goods to-morrow
at the candle by the Prize Office, where it will be sold for little,
and we shall be found to want the same goods and buy at extraordinary
prices, and perhaps the very same goods now sold, which is a most horrid
evil and a shame. At night home to supper and to bed with my mind mighty
light to see the fruits of my diligence in having my business go off my
hand so merrily.
