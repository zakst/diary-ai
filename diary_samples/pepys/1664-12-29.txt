29th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. Then whereas I
should have gone and dined with Sir W. Pen (and the rest of the officers
at his house), I pretended to dine with my Lady Sandwich and so home,
where I dined well, and began to wipe and clean my books in my chamber
in order to the settling of my papers and things there thoroughly, and
then to the office, where all the afternoon sitting, and in the evening
home to supper, and then to my work again.
