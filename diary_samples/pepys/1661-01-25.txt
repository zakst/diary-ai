25th. At the office all the morning. Dined at home and Mr. Hater with
me, and so I did make even with him for the last quarter. After dinner
he and I to look upon the instructions of my Lord Northumberland’s, but
we were interrupted by Mr. Salisbury’s coming in, who came to see me and
to show me my Lord’s picture in little, of his doing. And truly it is
strange to what a perfection he is come in a year’s time. From thence to
Paul’s Churchyard about books, and so back again home. This night
comes two cages, which I bought this evening for my canary birds, which
Captain Rooth this day sent me. So to bed.
