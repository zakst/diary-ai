27th. Up, and with W. Hewer to see W. Coventry again, but missed him
again, by coming too late, the man of [all] the world that I am resolved
to preserve an interest in. Thence to White Hall, and there at our
usual waiting on the Duke of York; and that being done, I away to the
Exchequer, to give a stop, and take some advice about my lost tally,
wherein I shall have some remedy, with trouble, and so home, and there
find Mr. Povy, by appointment, to dine with me; where a pretty good
dinner, but for want of thought in my wife it was but slovenly dressed
up; however, much pleasant discourse with him, and some serious; and he
tells me that he would, by all means, have me get to be a Parliament-man
the next Parliament, which he believes there will be one, which I do
resolve of. By and by comes my cozen Roger, and dines with us; and,
after dinner, did seal his mortgage, wherein I do wholly rely on his
honesty, not having so much as read over what he hath given me for it,
nor minded it, but do trust to his integrity therein. They all gone, I
to the office and there a while, and then home to ease my eyes and make
my wife read to me.
