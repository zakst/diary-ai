28th. Up, to set right some little matters of my Tangier accounts, and
so to the office, where busy all the morning, and then home with my
people to dinner, and after dinner comes about a petition for a poor
woman whose-ticket she would get paid, and so talked a little and did
baiser her, and so to the office, being pleased that this morning my
bookseller brings me home Marcennus’s book of musick,’ which costs me
L3 2s.; but is a very fine book. So to the office and did some business,
and then by coach to the New Exchange, and there by agreement at my
bookseller’s shop met Mercer and Gayet, and took them by water, first
to one of the Neat-houses, where walked in the garden, but nothing but a
bottle of wine to be had, though pleased with seeing the garden; and so
to Fox Hall, where with great pleasure we walked, and then to the upper
end of the further retired walk, and there sat and sang, and brought
great many gallants and fine people about us, and, upon the bench, we
did by and by eat and drink what we had, and very merry: and so with
much pleasure to the Old Swan, and walked with them home, and there left
them, and so I home to my business at the office a little, and so to
bed.
