21st. At the office all the morning. Thence my Lord Brunker carried me
as far as Mr. Povy’s, and there I ‘light and dined, meeting Mr. Sherwin,
Creed, &c., there upon his accounts. After dinner they parted and
Mr. Povy carried me to Somersett House, and there showed me the
Queene-Mother’s chamber and closett, most beautiful places for furniture
and pictures; and so down the great stone stairs to the garden, and
tried the brave echo upon the stairs; which continues a voice so long
as the singing three notes, concords, one after another, they all three
shall sound in consort together a good while most pleasantly. Thence
to a Tangier Committee at White Hall, where I saw nothing ordered by
judgment, but great heat and passion and faction now in behalf of my
Lord Bellasses, and to the reproach of my Lord Tiviott, and dislike as
it were of former proceedings. So away with Mr. Povy, he carrying me
homeward to Mark Lane in his coach, a simple fellow I now find him, to
his utter shame in his business of accounts, as none but a sorry foole
would have discovered himself; and yet, in little, light, sorry things
very cunning; yet, in the principal, the most ignorant man I ever met
with in so great trust as he is. To my office till past 12, and then
home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but
impute it to my fresh hare’s foote. Before I went to bed I sat up
till two o’clock in my chamber reading of Mr. Hooke’s Microscopicall
Observations, the most ingenious book that ever I read in my life.
