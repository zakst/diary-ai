May 1st. This morning I was told how the people of Deal have set up two
or three Maypoles, and have hung up their flags upon the top of them,
and do resolve to be very merry to-day. It being a very pleasant day, I
wished myself in Hide Park. This day I do count myself to have had full
two years of perfect cure for the stone, for which God of heaven
be blessed. This day Captain Parker came on board, and without his
expectation I had a commission for him for the Nonsuch frigate

     [The “Nonsuch” was a fourth-rate of thirty-two guns, built at
     Deptford in 1646 by Peter Pett, jun.  The captain was John Parker.]

(he being now in the Cheriton), for which he gave me a French pistole.
Captain H. Cuttance has commission for the Cheriton. After dinner to
nine-pins, and won something. The rest of the afternoon in my cabin
writing and piping. While we were at supper we heard a great noise upon
the Quarter Deck, so we all rose instantly, and found it was to save the
coxon of the Cheriton, who, dropping overboard, could not be saved, but
was drowned. To-day I put on my suit that was altered from the great
skirts to little ones. To-day I hear they were very merry at Deal,
setting up the King’s flag upon one of their maypoles, and drinking his
health upon their knees in the streets, and firing the guns, which the
soldiers of the Castle threatened; but durst not oppose.
