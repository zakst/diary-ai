19th. This morning my wife dressed herself fine to go to the christening
of Mrs. Huntâ€™s child, and so she and I in the way in the morning went to
the Paynter s, and there she sat till noon, and I all the while looking
over great variety of good prints which he had, and by and by comes my
boy to tell us that Mrs. Hunt has been at our house to tell us that the
christening is not till Saturday next. So after the Paynter had done I
did like the picture pretty well, and my wife and I went by coach home,
but in the way I took occasion to fall out with my wife very highly
about her ribbands being ill matched and of two colours, and to very
high words, so that, like a passionate fool, I did call her whore,
for which I was afterwards sorry. But I set her down at home, and went
myself by appointment to the Dolphin, where Sir W. Warren did give us
all a good dinner, and that being done, to the office, and there sat
late, and so home.
