22nd. Up, and after much pleasant talke and being importuned by my wife
and her two mayds, which are both good wenches, for me to buy a necklace
of pearle for her, and I promising to give her one of L60 in two years
at furthest, and in less if she pleases me in her painting, I went away
and walked to Greenwich, in my way seeing a coffin with a dead body
therein, dead of the plague, lying in an open close belonging to
Coome farme, which was carried out last night, and the parish have not
appointed any body to bury it; but only set a watch there day and night,
that nobody should go thither or come thence, which is a most cruel
thing: this disease making us more cruel to one another than if we are
doggs. So to the King’s House, and there met my Lord Bruncker and Sir
J. Minnes, and to our lodgings again that are appointed for us, which do
please me better to day than last night, and are set a doing. Thence I
to Deptford, where by appointment I find Mr. Andrews come, and to the
Globe, where we dined together and did much business as to our Plymouth
gentlemen; and after a good dinner and good discourse, he being a very
good man, I think verily, we parted and I to the King’s yard, walked
up and down, and by and by out at the back gate, and there saw the
Bagwell’s wife’s mother and daughter, and went to them, and went in
to the daughter’s house with the mother, and ‘faciebam le cose que ego
tenebam a mind to con elle’, and drinking and talking, by and by away,
and so walked to Redriffe, troubled to go through the little lane, where
the plague is, but did and took water and home, where all well; but Mr.
Andrews not coming to even accounts, as I expected, with relation to
something of my own profit, I was vexed that I could not settle to
business, but home to my viall, though in the evening he did come to
my satisfaction. So after supper (he being gone first) I to settle my
journall and to bed.
