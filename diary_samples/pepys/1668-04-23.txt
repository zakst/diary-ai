23rd. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon comes
Knepp and Mrs. Pierce, and her daughter, and one Mrs. Foster, and dined
with me, and mighty merry, and after dinner carried them to the Tower,
and shewed them all to be seen there, and, among other things, the Crown
and Scepters and rich plate, which I myself never saw before, and indeed
is noble, and I mightily pleased with it. Thence by water to the Temple,
and thereto the Cocke alehouse, and drank, and eat a lobster, and sang,
and mighty merry. So, almost night, I carried Mrs. Pierce home, and then
Knepp and I to the Temple again, and took boat, it being darkish, and to
Fox Hall, it being now night, and a bonfire burning at Lambeth for the
King’s coronation-day. And there she and I drank;.... and so back, and
led her home, it being now ten at night; and so got a link; and, walking
towards home, just at my entrance into the ruines at St. Dunstan’s, I
was met by two rogues with clubs, who come towards us. So I went back,
and walked home quite round by the wall, and got well home, and to
bed weary, but pleased at my day’s pleasure, but yet displeased at my
expence, and time I lose.
