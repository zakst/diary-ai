June 1st. Up and to the office, where sat all the morning, at noon to
the ‘Change, and there did some business, and home to dinner, whither
Creed comes, and after dinner I put on my new silke camelott sute; the
best that ever I wore in my life, the sute costing me above L24. In
this I went with Creed to Goldsmiths’ Hall, to the burial of Sir Thomas
Viner; which Hall, and Haberdashers also, was so full of people, that
we were fain for ease and coolness to go forth to Pater Noster Row, to
choose a silke to make me a plain ordinary suit. That done, we walked to
Cornehill, and there at Mr. Cade’s’ stood in the balcon and saw all
the funeral, which was with the blue-coat boys and old men, all the
Aldermen, and Lord Mayor, &c., and the number of the company very great;
the greatest I ever did see for a taverne. Hither come up to us Dr.
Allen, and then Mr. Povy and Mr. Fox. The show being over, and my
discourse with Mr. Povy, I took coach and to Westminster Hall, where
I took the fairest flower, and by coach to Tothill Fields for the ayre
till it was dark. I ‘light, and in with the fairest flower to eat a
cake, and there did do as much as was safe with my flower, and that was
enough on my part. Broke up, and away without any notice, and, after
delivering the rose where it should be, I to the Temple and ‘light, and
come to the middle door, and there took another coach, and so home to
write letters, but very few, God knows, being by my pleasure made to
forget everything that is. The coachman that carried [us] cannot know me
again, nor the people at the house where we were. Home to bed, certain
news being come that our fleete is in sight of the Dutch ships.
