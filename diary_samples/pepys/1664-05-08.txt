8th (Lord’s day). This day my new tailor, Mr. Langford, brought me home
a new black cloth suit and cloake lined with silk moyre, and he being
gone, who pleases me very well with his work and I hope will use me
pretty well, then Deane and I to my chamber, and there we repeated my
yesterday’s lesson about ships all the morning, and I hope I shall soon
understand it. At noon to dinner, and strange how in discourse he cries
up chymistry from some talk he has had with an acquaintance of his,
a chymist, when, poor man, he understands not one word of it. But
I discern very well that it is only his good nature, but in this of
building ships he hath taken great pains, more than most builders I
believe have. After dinner he went away, and my wife and I to church,
and after church to Sir W. Pen, and there sat and talked with him,
and the perfidious rogue seems, as he do always, mightily civil to us,
though I know he hates and envies us. So home to supper, prayers, and to
bed.
