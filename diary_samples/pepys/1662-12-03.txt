3rd. Called up by Commissioner Pett, and with him by water, much against
my will, to Deptford, and after drinking a warm morning draft, with Mr.
Wood and our officers measuring all the morning his New England masts,
with which sight I was much pleased for my information, though I
perceive great neglect and indifference in all the King’s officers in
what they do for the King. That done, to the Globe, and there dined with
Mr. Wood, and so by water with Mr. Pett home again, all the way reading
his Chest accounts, in which I did see things did not please me; as
his allowing himself 1300 for one year’s looking to the business of
the Chest, and L150 per annum for the rest of the years. But I found no
fault to him himself, but shall when they come to be read at the Board.
We did also call at Limehouse to view two Busses that are building,
that being a thing we are now very hot upon. Our call was to see what
dimensions they are of, being 50 feet by the keel and about 60 tons.
Home and did a little business, and so taking Mr. Pett by the way, we
walked to the Temple, in our way seeing one of the Russia Embassador’s
coaches go along, with his footmen not in liverys, but their country
habits; one of one colour and another of another, which was very
strange. At the Temple spoke with Mr. Turner and Calthrop, and so walked
home again, being in some pain through the cold which I have got to-day
by water, which troubles me. At the office doing business a good while,
and so home and had a posset, and so to bed.
