6th (Lordâ€™s day). To church. Home, and after dinner walked to White
Hall, thinking to have seen Mr. Coventry, but failed, and therefore
walked clear on foot back again. Busy till night in fitting my
Victualling papers in order, which I through my multitude of business
and pleasure have not examined these several months. Walked back again
home, and so to the Victualling Office, where I met Mr. Gawden, and have
received some satisfaction, though it be short of what I expected, and
what might be expected from me. So after evened I have gone, and so to
supper and to bed.
