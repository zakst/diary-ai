21st. Up, and walked to the Temple, it being frosty, and there took
coach, my boy Tom with me, and so to White Hall to a Committee of
Tangier, where they met, and by and by and till twelve at noon upon
business, among others mine, where my desire about being eased of
appointing and standing accountable for a Treasurer there was well
accepted, and they will think of some other way. This I was glad of,
finding reason to doubt that I might in this (since my Lord Sandwich
made me understand what he had said to the Duke of York herein) fear to
offend either the Duke of York by denying it, for he seemed on Sunday
night last, when I first made known my desire to him herein to be a
little amused at it, though I knew not then the reason, or else offend
my Lord Sandwich by accepting it, or denying it in a manner that might
not forward his desire for Sir Charles Harbord, but I thank God I did it
to my great content without any offence, I think, to either. Thence in
my own coach home, where I find Madam Turner, Dyke, and The., and had
a good dinner for them, and merry; and so carried them to the Duke of
York’s house, all but Dyke, who went away on other business; and there
saw “The Tempest;” but it is but ill done by Gosnell, in lieu of Moll
Davis. Thence set them at home, and my wife and I to the ‘Change, and so
home, where my wife mighty dogged, and I vexed to see it, being
mightily troubled, of late, at her being out of humour, for fear of her
discovering any new matter of offence against me, though I am conscious
of none; but do hate to be unquiet at home. So, late up, silent, and
not supping, but hearing her utter some words of discontent to me
with silence, and so to bed, weeping to myself for grief, which she
discerning, come to bed, and mighty kind, and so with great joy on both
sides to sleep.
