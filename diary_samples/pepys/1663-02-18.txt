18th. Up, leaving my wife sick as last night in bed. I to my office all
the morning, casting up with Captain Cocke their accounts of 500 tons
of hemp brought from Riga, and bought by him and partners upon account,
wherein are many things worth my knowledge. So at noon to dinner, taking
Mr. Hater with me because of losing them, and in the afternoon he and
I alone at the office, finishing our account of the extra charge of the
Navy, not properly belonging to the Navy, since the King’s coming in to
Christmas last; and all extra things being abated, I find that the true
charge of the Navy to that time hath been after the rate of L374,743
a-year. I made an end by eleven o’clock at night, and so home to bed
almost weary. This day the Parliament met again, after their long
prorogation; but I know not any thing what they have done, being within
doors all day.
