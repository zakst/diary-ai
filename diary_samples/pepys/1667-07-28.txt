28th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and to my chamber, where all the morning close,
to draw up a letter to Sir W. Coventry upon the tidings of peace, taking
occasion, before I am forced to it, to resign up to his Royall Highness
my place of the Victualling, and to recommend myself to him by promise
of doing my utmost to improve this peace in the best manner we may, to
save the kingdom from ruin. By noon I had done this to my good content,
and then with my wife all alone to dinner, and so to my chamber all the
afternoon to write my letter fair, and sent it away, and then to talk
with my wife, and read, and so by daylight (the only time I think I have
done it this year) to supper, and then to my chamber to read and so to
bed, my mind very much eased after what I have done to-day.
