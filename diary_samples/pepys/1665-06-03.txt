3rd. Up and to White Hall, where Sir G. Carteret did go with me to
Secretary Morris, and prevailed with him to let Mr. Hater be released
upon bail for his appearance. So I at a loss how to get another besides
myself, and got Mr. Hunt, who did patiently stay with me all the morning
at Secretary Morrisâ€™s chamber, Mr. Hater being sent for with his
keeper, and at noon comes in the Secretary, and upon entering [into]
recognizances, he for L200, and Mr. Hunt and I for L100 each for his
appearance upon demand, he was released, it costing him, I think, above
L3. I thence home, vexed to be kept from the office all the morning,
which I had not been in many months before, if not some years. At home
to dinner, and all the afternoon at the office, where late at night, and
much business done, then home to supper and to bed. All this day by all
people upon the River, and almost every where else hereabout were heard
the guns, our two fleets for certain being engaged; which was confirmed
by letters from Harwich, but nothing particular: and all our hearts full
of concernment for the Duke, and I particularly for my Lord Sandwich and
Mr. Coventry after his Royall Highnesse.
