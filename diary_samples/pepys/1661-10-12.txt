12th. In bed the greatest part of this day also, and my swelling in some
measure gone. I received a letter this day from my father, that Sir
R. Bernard do a little fear that my uncle has not observed exactly the
custom of Brampton in his will about his lands there, which puts me to a
great trouble in mind, and at, night wrote to him and to my father about
it, being much troubled at it.
