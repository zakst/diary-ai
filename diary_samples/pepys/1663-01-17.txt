17th. Waked early with my mind troubled about our law matters, but it
came into my mind that [sayings] of Epictetus, which did put me to a
great deal of ease, it being a saying of great reason. Up to the office,
and there sat Mr. Coventry, Mr. Pett, new come to town, and I. I was
sorry for signing a bill and guiding Mr. Coventry to sign a bill to Mr.
Creed for his pay as Deputy Treasurer to this day, though the service
ended 5 or 6 months ago, which he perceiving did blot out his name
afterwards, but I will clear myself to him from design in it. Sat
till two o’clock and then home to dinner, and Creed with me, and after
dinner, to put off my mind’s trouble, I took Creed by coach and to the
Duke’s playhouse, where we did see “The Five Hours” entertainment again,
which indeed is a very fine play, though, through my being out of order,
it did not seem so good as at first; but I could discern it was not
any fault in the play. Thence with him to the China alehouse, and
there drank a bottle or two, and so home, where I found my wife and her
brother discoursing about Mr. Ashwell’s daughter, whom we are like to
have for my wife’s woman, and I hope it may do very well, seeing there
is a necessity of having one. So to the office to write letters, and
then home to supper and to bed.
