15th. My father and I up and walked alone to Hinchingbroke; and among
the other late chargeable works that my Lord hath done there, we saw
his water-works and the Oral which is very fine; and so is the house all
over, but I am sorry to think of the money at this time spent
therein. Back to my fatherâ€™s (Mr. Sheply being out of town) and there
breakfasted, after making an end with Barton about his businesses,
and then my mother called me into the garden, and there but all to no
purpose desiring me to be friends with John, but I told her I cannot,
nor indeed easily shall, which afflicted the poor woman, but I cannot
help it. Then taking leave, W. Joyce and I set out, calling T. Trice at
Bugden, and thence got by night to Stevenage, and there mighty merry,
though I in bed more weary than the other two days, which, I think,
proceeded from our galloping so much, my other weariness being almost
all over; but I find that a coney skin in my breeches preserves me
perfectly from galling, and that eating after I come to my Inne, without
drinking, do keep me from being stomach sick, which drink do presently
make me. We lay all in several beds in the same room, and W. Joyce full
of his impertinent tricks and talk, which then made us merry, as any
other fool would have done. So to sleep.
