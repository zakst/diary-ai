4th. Lord’s day. Before I went to church I sang Orpheus’ Hymn to my
viall. After that to Mr. Gunning’s, an excellent sermon upon charity.
Then to my mother to dinner, where my wife and the maid were come. After
dinner we three to Mr. Messum’s where we met Mons. L’Impertinent, who
got us a seat and told me a ridiculous story how that last week he had
caused a simple citizen to spend; L80 in entertainments of him and some
friends of his upon pretence of some service that he would do him in his
suit after a widow. Then to my mother again, and after supper she and I
talked very high about religion, I in defence of the religion I was born
in. Then home.
