20th (Lordâ€™s day). At home in bed all the morning to ease my late
tumour, but up to dinner and much offended in mind at a proud trick my
man Will hath got, to keep his hat on in the house, but I will not speak
of it to him to-day; but I fear I shall be troubled with his pride and
laziness, though in other things he is good enough. To church in the
afternoon, where a sleepy Presbyter preached, and then to Sir W. Batten
who is to go to Portsmouth to-morrow to wait upon the Duke of York, who
goes to take possession and to set in order the garrison there. Supped
at home and to bed.
