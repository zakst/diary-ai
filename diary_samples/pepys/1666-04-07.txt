7th. Lay pretty long to-day, lying alone and thinking of several
businesses. So up to the office and there till noon. Thence with my
Lord Bruncker home by coach to Mrs. Williams’s, where Bab. Allen and
Dr. Charleton dined. Bab and I sang and were mighty merry as we could be
there, where the rest of the company did not overplease. Thence took her
by coach to Hales’s, and there find Mrs. Pierce and her boy and Mary.
She had done sitting the first time, and indeed her face is mighty like
at first dash. Thence took them to the cakehouse, and there called in
the coach for cakes and drank, and thence I carried them to my Lord
Chancellor’s new house to shew them that, and all mightily pleased,
thence set each down at home, and so I home to the office, where about
ten of the clock W. Hewer comes to me to tell me that he has left my
wife well this morning at Bugden, which was great riding, and brings me
a letter from her. She is very well got thither, of which I am heartily
glad. After writing several letters, I home to supper and to bed. The
Parliament of which I was afraid of their calling us of the Navy to an
account of the expense of money and stores and wherein we were so
little ready to give them a good answer [will soon meet]. The Bishop of
Munster, every body says, is coming to peace with the Dutch, we having
not supplied him with the money promised him.
