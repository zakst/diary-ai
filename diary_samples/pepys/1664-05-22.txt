22nd (Lord’s day). Up and by water to White Hall to my Lord’s lodgings,
and with him walked to White Hall without any great discourse, nor do I
find that he do mind business at all. Here the Duke of Yorke called me
to him, to ask me whether I did intend to go with him to Chatham or no.
I told him if he commanded, but I did believe there would be business
here for me, and so he told me then it would be better to stay, which
I suppose he will take better than if I had been forward to go. Thence,
after staying and seeing the throng of people to attend the King to
Chappell (but, Lord! what a company of sad, idle people they are) I
walked to St. James’s with Colonell Remes, where staid a good while and
then walked to White Hall with Mr. Coventry, talking about business. So
meeting Creed, took him with me home and to dinner, a good dinner,
and thence by water to Woolwich, where mighty kindly received by Mrs.
Falconer and her husband, who is now pretty well again, this being the
first time I ever carried my wife thither. I walked to the Docke, where
I met Mrs. Ackworth alone at home, and God forgive me! what thoughts
I had, but I had not the courage to stay, but went to Mr. Pett’s
and walked up and down the yard with him and Deane talking about the
dispatch of the ships now in haste, and by and by Creed and my wife and
a friend of Mr. Falconer’s came with the boat and called me, and so by
water to Deptford, where I landed, and after talking with others walked
to Half-way house with Mr. Wayth talking about the business of his
supplying us with canvas, and he told me in discourse several instances
of Sir W. Batten’s cheats. So to Half-way house, whither my wife and
them were gone before, and after drinking there we walked, and by water
home, sending Creed and the other with the boat home. Then wrote a
letter to Mr. Coventry, and so a good supper of pease, the first I eat
this year, and so to bed.
