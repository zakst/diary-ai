14th. Up betimes, and my wife’s mind and mine holding for her going,
so she to get her ready, and I abroad to do the like for myself, and so
home, and after setting every thing at my office and at home in order,
by coach to Bishop’s Gate, it being a very promising fair day. There
at the Dolphin we met my uncle Thomas and his son-in-law, which seems a
very sober man, and Mr. Moore. So Mr. Moore and my wife set out
before, and my uncle and I staid for his son Thomas, who, by a sudden
resolution, is preparing to go with us, which makes me fear something of
mischief which they design to do us. He staying a great while, the old
man and I before, and about eight miles off, his son comes after us, and
about six miles further we overtake Mr. Moore and my wife, which makes
me mightily consider what a great deal of ground is lost in a little
time, when it is to be got up again by another, that is to go his own
ground and the other’s too; and so after a little bayte (I paying all
the reckonings the whole journey) at Ware, to Buntingford, where my
wife, by drinking some cold beer, being hot herself, presently after
‘lighting, begins to be sick, and became so pale, and I alone with her
in a great chamber there, that I thought she would have died, and so in
great horror, and having a great tryall of my true love and passion
for her, called the mayds and mistresse of the house, and so with some
strong water, and after a little vomit, she came to be pretty well
again; and so to bed, and I having put her to bed with great content, I
called in my company, and supped in the chamber by her, and being very
merry in talk, supped and then parted, and I to bed and lay very well.
This day my cozen Thomas dropped his hanger, and it was lost.
