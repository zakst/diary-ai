23rd. This morning Mr. Barlow comes to me, and he and I went forth to
a scrivener in Fenchurch Street, whom we found sick of the gout in bed,
and signed and sealed our agreement before him. He urged to have these
words (in consideration whereof) to be interlined, which I granted,
though against my will. Met this morning at the office, and afterwards
Mr. Barlow by appointment came and dined with me, and both of us very
pleasant and pleased. After dinner to my Lord, who took me to Secretary
Nicholas, and there before him and Secretary Morris, my Lord and I upon
our knees together took our oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and the
Oath of the Privy Seal, of which I was much glad, though I am not likely
to get anything by it at present; but I do desire it, for fear of a
turn-out of our office. That done and my Lord gone from me, I went with
Mr. Cooling and his brother, and Sam Hartlibb, little Jennings and some
others to the Kingâ€™s Head Tavern at Charing Cross, where after drinking
I took boat and so home, where we supped merrily among ourselves (our
little boy proving a droll) and so after prayers to bed. This day my
Lord had heard that Mr. Barnwell was dead, but it is not so yet, though
he be very ill. I was troubled all this day with Mr. Cooke, being
willing to do him good, but my mind is so taken up with my own business
that I cannot.
