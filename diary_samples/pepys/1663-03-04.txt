4th. Lay long talking with my wife about ordering things in our family,
and then rose and to my office, there collecting an alphabet for my
Navy Manuscript, which, after a short dinner, I returned to and by night
perfected to my great content. So to other business till 9 at night, and
so home to supper and to bed.
