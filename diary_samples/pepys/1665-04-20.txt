20th. Up, and all the morning busy at the office. At noon dined, and Mr.
Povy by agreement with me (where his boldness with Mercer, poor innocent
wench, did make both her and me blush, to think how he were able to
debauch a poor girl if he had opportunity) at a dish or two of plain
meat of his own choice. After dinner comes Creed and then Andrews, where
want of money to Andrews the main discourse, and at last in confidence
of Creedâ€™s judgement I am resolved to spare him 4 or L500 of what lies
by me upon the security of some Tallys. This went against my heart to
begin, but when obtaining Mr. Creed to joyne with me we do resolve to
assist Mr. Andrews. Then anon we parted, and I to my office, where late,
and then home to supper and to bed. This night I am told the first play
is played in White Hall noon-hall, which is now turned to a house of
playing. I had a great mind, but could not go to see it.
