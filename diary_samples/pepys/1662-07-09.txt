9th. Up by four o’clock, and at my multiplicacion-table hard, which is
all the trouble I meet withal in my arithmetique. So made me ready and
to the office, where all the morning busy, and Sir W. Pen came to my
office to take his leave of me, and desiring a turn in the garden, did
commit the care of his building to me, and offered all his services to
me in all matters of mine. I did, God forgive me! promise him all my
service and love, though the rogue knows he deserves none from me, nor
do I intend to show him any; but as he dissembles with me, so must I
with him. Dined at home, and so to the office again, my wife with me,
and while I was for an hour making a hole behind my seat in my closet to
look into the office, she was talking to me about her going to Brampton,
which I would willingly have her to do but for the cost of it, and to
stay here will be very inconvenient because of the dirt that I must have
when my house is pulled down. Then to my business till night, then Mr.
Cooper and I to our business, and then came Mr. Mills, the minister, to
see me, which he hath but rarely done to me, though every day almost
to others of us; but he is a cunning fellow, and knows where the good
victuals is, and the good drink, at Sir W. Batten’s. However, I used him
civilly, though I love him as I do the rest of his coat. So to supper
and to bed.
