30th. Up and, being ready, to finish my journall for four days past.
To the office, where busy all the morning. At noon dined alone, my wife
gone abroad to conclude about her necklace of pearle. I after dinner
to even all my accounts of this month; and, bless God! I find myself,
notwithstanding great expences of late; viz. L80 now to pay for a
necklace; near L40 for a set of chairs and couch; near L40 for my three
pictures: yet I do gather, and am now worth L5200. My wife comes home
by and by, and hath pitched upon a necklace with three rows, which is a
very good one, and L80 is the price. In the evening, having finished
my accounts to my full content and joyed that I have evened them so
plainly, remembering the trouble my last accounts did give me by being
let alone a little longer than ordinary, by which I am to this day at
a loss for L50, I hope I shall never commit such an error again, for
I cannot devise where the L50 should be, but it is plain I ought to be
worth L50 more than I am, and blessed be God the error was no greater.
In the evening with my [wife] and Mercer by coach to take the ayre as
far as Bow, and eat and drank in the coach by the way and with much
pleasure and pleased with my company. At night home and up to the leads,
but were contrary to expectation driven down again with a stinke by
Sir W. Penâ€™s shying of a shitten pot in their house of office close by,
which do trouble me for fear it do hereafter annoy me. So down to sing a
little and then to bed. So ends this month with great layings-out. Good
health and gettings, and advanced well in the whole of my estate, for
which God make me thankful.
