18th (Lord’s day). To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr. Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry. After dinner I took my wife and Mr. Sidney to my Lady to
see my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and
walks about his chamber. So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my
Lord General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce
and sat with her; and then to walk in St. James’s Park, and saw great
variety of fowl which I never saw before and so home. At night fell to
read in “Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity,” which Mr. Moore did give me
last Wednesday very handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great
pains and love for his sake. So to supper and to bed.
