14th. At the office all the morning, at noon to the Change, and then
home again. To dinner, where my uncle Fenner by appointment came and
dined with me, thinking to go together to my aunt Kite’s that is dead;
but before we had dined comes Sir R. Slingsby and his lady, and a great
deal of company, to take my wife and I out by barge to shew them the
King’s and Duke’s yachts. So I was forced to leave my uncle and brother
Tom at dinner and go forth with them, and we had great pleasure, seeing
all four yachts, viz., these two and the two Dutch ones. And so home
again, and after writing letters by post, to bed.
