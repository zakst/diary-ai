26th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon to the
‘Change, after being at the Coffee-house, where I sat by Tom Killigrew,
who told us of a fire last night in my Lady Castlemaine’s lodging, where
she bid L40 for one to adventure the fetching of a cabinet out, which
at last was got to be done; and the fire at last quenched without doing
much wrong. To ‘Change and there did much business, so home to dinner,
and then to the office all the afternoon. And so at night my aunt Wight
and Mrs. Buggin came to sit with my wife, and I in to them all the
evening, my uncle coming afterward, and after him Mr. Benson the
Dutchman, a frank, merry man. We were very merry and played at cards
till late and so broke up and to bed in good hopes that this my
friendship with my uncle and aunt will end well.
