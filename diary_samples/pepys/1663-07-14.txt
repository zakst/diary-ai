14th. Up a little late, last night recovering my sleepiness for the
night before, which was lost, and so to my office to put papers and
things to right, and making up my journal from Wednesday last to this
day. All the morning at my office doing of business; at noon Mr. Hunt
came to me, and he and I to the Exchange, and a Coffee House, and drank
there, and thence to my house to dinner, whither my uncle Thomas came,
and he tells me that he is going down to Wisbech, there to try what he
can recover of my uncle Day’s estate, and seems to have good arguments
for what he do go about, in which I wish him good speed. I made him
almost foxed, the poor man having but a bad head, and not used I believe
nowadays to drink much wine. So after dinner, they being gone, I to my
office, and so home to bed. This day I hear the judges, according to
order yesterday, did bring into the Lords’ House their reasons of their
judgment in the business between my Lord Bristoll and the Chancellor;
and the Lords do concur with the Judges that the articles are not
treason, nor regularly brought into the House, and so voted that a
Committee should be chosen to examine them; but nothing to be done
therein till the next sitting of this Parliament (which is like to
be adjourned in a day or two), and in the mean time the two Lords to,
remain without prejudice done to either of them.
