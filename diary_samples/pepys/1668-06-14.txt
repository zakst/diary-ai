14th (Sunday). Up, and walked up and down the town, and saw a pretty
good market-place, and many good streets, and very fair stone-houses.
And so to the great Church, and there saw Bishop Montagu’s tomb;

     [James Montagu, Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1608, and of Winchester
     in 1616--died 1618.  He was uncle to the Earl of Sandwich, whose
     mother was Pepys’s aunt.  Hence Pepys’s curiosity respecting the
     tomb.--B.]

and, when placed, did there see many brave people come, and, among
others, two men brought in, in litters, and set down in the chancel
to hear: but I did not know one face. Here a good organ; but a vain,
pragmatical fellow preached a ridiculous, affected sermon, that made
me angry, and some gentlemen that sat next me, and sang well. So home,
walking round the walls of the City, which are good, and the battlements
all whole. The sexton of the church is. So home to dinner, and after
dinner comes Mr. Butts again to see me, and he and I to church, where
the same idle fellow preached; and I slept most of the sermon. Thence
home, and took my wife out and the girls, and come to this church again,
to see it, and look over the monuments, where, among others, Dr. Venner
and Pelting, and a lady of Sir W. Walter’s; he lying with his face
broken. So to the fields a little and walked, and then home and had my
head looked [at], and so to supper, and then comes my landlord to me, a
sober understanding man, and did give me a good account of the antiquity
of this town and Wells; and of two Heads, on two pillars, in Wells
church. But he a Catholick. So he gone, I to bed.
