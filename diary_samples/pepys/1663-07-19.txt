19th (Lord’s day). Lay very long in pleasant dreams till Church time,
and so up, and it being foul weather so that I cannot walk as I intended
to meet my Cozen Roger at Thomas Pepys’s house (whither he rode last
night), to Hatcham, I went to church, where a sober Doctor made a good
sermon. So home to dinner alone, and then to read a little, and so to
church again, where the Scot made an ordinary sermon, and so home to my
office, and there read over my vows and increased them by a vow against
all strong drink till November next of any sort or quantity, by which I
shall try how I can forbear it. God send it may not prejudice my health,
and then I care not. Then I fell to read over a silly play writ by a
person of honour (which is, I find, as much as to say a coxcomb), called
“Love a la Mode,”’ and that being ended, home, and played on my lute and
sung psalms till bedtime, then to prayers and to bed.
