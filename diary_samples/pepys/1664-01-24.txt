24th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay long in bed, and then up, and being desirous to
perform my vowes that I lately made, among others, to be performed
this month, I did go to my office, and there fell on entering, out of
a bye-book, part of my second journall-book, which hath lain these two
years and more unentered. Upon this work till dinner, and after dinner
to it again till night, and then home to supper, and after supper to
read a lecture to my wife upon the globes, and so to prayers and to bed.
This evening also I drew up a rough draught of my last will to my mind.
