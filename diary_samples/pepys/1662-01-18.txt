18th. This morning I went to Dr. Williams, and there he told me how
T. Trice had spoke to him about getting me to meet that our difference
might be made up between us by ourselves, which I am glad of, and have
appointed Monday next to be the day. Thence to the Wardrobe, and there
hearing it would be late before they went to dinner, I went and spent
some time in Paul’s Churchyard among some books, and then returned
thither, and there dined with my Lady and Sir H. Wright and his lady,
all glad of yesterday’s mistake, and after dinner to the office, and
then home and wrote letters by the post to my father, and by and by
comes Mr. Moore to give me an account how Mr. Montagu was gone away of
a sudden with the fleet, in such haste that he hath left behind some
servants, and many things of consequence; and among others, my Lord’s
commission for Embassador. Whereupon he and I took coach, and to White
Hall to my Lord’s lodgings, to have spoke with Mr. Ralph Montagu, his
brother (and here we staid talking with Sarah and the old man); but by
and by hearing that he was in Covent Garden, we went thither: and at
my Lady Harvy’s, his sister, I spoke with him, and he tells me that the
commission is not left behind. And so I went thence by the same coach
(setting down Mr. Moore) home, and after having wrote a letter to my
Lord at 12 o’clock at night by post I went to bed.
