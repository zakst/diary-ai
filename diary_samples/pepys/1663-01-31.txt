31st. Up and to my office, and there we sat till noon. I home to dinner,
and there found my plate of the Soverayne with the table to it come from
Mr. Christopher Pett, of which I am very glad. So to dinner late, and
not very good, only a rabbit not half roasted, which made me angry with
my wife. So to the office, and there till late, busy all the while. In
the evening examining my wifeâ€™s letter intended to my Lady, and another
to Mademoiselle; they were so false spelt that I was ashamed of them,
and took occasion to fall out about them with my wife, and so she wrote
none, at which, however, I was, sorry, because it was in answer to a
letter of Madam about business. Late home to supper and to bed.
