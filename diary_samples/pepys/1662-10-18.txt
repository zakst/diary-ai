18th. Up and to the office, Mr. Coventry and I alone sat till two
o’clock, and then he inviting himself to my house to dinner, of which
I was proud; but my dinner being a legg of mutton and two capons, they
were not done enough, which did vex me; but we made shift to please
him, I think; but I was, when he was gone, very angry with my wife and
people. This afternoon came my wife’s brother and his wife, and Mrs.
Lodum his landlady (my old friend Mr. Ashwell’s sister), Balty’s wife is
a most little and yet, I believe, pretty old girl, not handsome, nor has
anything in the world pleasing, but, they say, she plays mighty well on
the Base Violl. They dined at her father’s today, but for ought I hear
he is a wise man, and will not give any thing to his daughter till he
sees what her husband do put himself to, so that I doubt he has made but
a bad matter of it, but I am resolved not to meddle with it. They gone I
to the office, and to see Sir W. Pen, with my wife, and thence I to Mr.
Cade the stationer, to direct him what to do with my two copies of Mr.
Holland’s books which he is to bind, and after supplying myself with
several things of him, I returned to my office, and so home to supper
and to bed.
