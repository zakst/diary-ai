26th. Up, and all the morning and most of the afternoon within doors,
beginning to set my accounts in order from before this fire, I being
behindhand with them ever since; and this day I got most of my tradesmen
to bring in their bills and paid them. Dined at home, and busy again
after dinner, and then abroad by water to Westminster Hall, where I
walked till the evening, and then out, the first time I ever was abroad
with Doll Lane, to the Dog tavern, and there drank with her, a bad face,
but good bodied girle. Did nothing but salute and play with her and
talk, and thence away by coach, home, and so to do a little more in my
accounts, and then to supper and to bed. Nothing done in the House yet
as to the finishing of the bill for money, which is a mighty sad thing,
all lying at stake for it.
