24th. In the morning to the office and Commissioner Pett (who seldom
comes there) told me that he had lately presented a piece of plate
(being a couple of flaggons) to Mr. Coventry, but he did not receive
them, which also put me upon doing the same too; and so after dinner
I went and chose a payre of candlesticks to be made ready for me at
Alderman Backwellâ€™s. To the office again in the afternoon till night,
and so home, and with the painters till 10 at night, making an end of my
house and the arch before my door, and so this night I was rid of them
and all other work, and my house was made ready against to-morrow being
Christmas day. This day the Princess Royal died at Whitehall.
