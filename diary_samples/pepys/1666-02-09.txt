9th. Up, and betimes to Sir Philip Warwicke, who was glad to see me, and
very kind. Thence to Colonell Norwood’s lodgings, and there set about
Houblons’ business about their ships. Thence to Westminster, to the
Exchequer, about my Tangier business to get orders for tallys, and so
to the Hall, where the first day of the Terme, and the Hall very full
of people, and much more than was expected, considering the plague that
hath been. Thence to the ‘Change, and to the Sun behind it to dinner
with the Lieutenant of the Tower, Colonell Norwood and others, where
strange pleasure they seem to take in their wine and meate, and
discourse of it with the curiosity and joy that methinks was below men
of worthe. Thence home, and there very much angry with my people till
I had put all things in good forwardnesse about my supper for the
Houblons, but that being done I was in good humour again, and all things
in good order. Anon the five brothers Houblons come and Mr. Hill, and
a very good supper we had, and good company and discourse, with great
pleasure. My new plate sets off my cupboard very nobly. Here they were
till about eleven at night with great pleasure, and a fine sight it
is to see these five brothers thus loving one to another, and all
industrious merchants. Our subject was principally Mr. Hill’s going for
them to Portugall, which was the occasion of this entertainment. They
gone, we to bed.
