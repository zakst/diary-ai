28th. At the office all the morning; dined at home, and after dinner to
Fleet Street, with my sword to Mr. Brigden (lately made Captain of the
Auxiliaries) to be refreshed, and with him to an ale-house, where I met
Mr. Davenport; and after some talk of Cromwell, Ireton and Bradshaw’s
bodies being taken out of their graves to-day,

     [“The bodies of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, John Bradshaw, and
     Thomas Pride, were dug up out of their graves to be hanged at
     Tyburn, and buried under the gallows.  Cromwell’s vault having been
     opened, the people crowded very much to see him.”--Rugge’s Diurnal.]

I went to Mr. Crew’s and thence to the Theatre, where I saw again
“The Lost Lady,” which do now please me better than before; and here
I sitting behind in a dark place, a lady spit backward upon me by a
mistake, not seeing me, but after seeing her to be a very pretty lady,
I was not troubled at it at all. Thence to Mr. Crew’s, and there met Mr.
Moore, who came lately to me, and went with me to my father’s, and with
him to Standing’s, whither came to us Dr. Fairbrother, who I took and my
father to the Bear and gave a pint of sack and a pint of claret.

He do still continue his expressions of respect and love to me, and
tells me my brother John will make a good scholar. Thence to see the
Doctor at his lodging at Mr. Holden’s, where I bought a hat, cost
me 35s. So home by moonshine, and by the way was overtaken by the
Comptroller’s coach, and so home to his house with him. So home and to
bed. This noon I had my press set up in my chamber for papers to be put
in.
