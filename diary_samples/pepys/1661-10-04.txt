4th. By coach to White Hall with Sir W. Pen. So to Mr. Montagu, where
his man, Mons. Eschar, makes a great com plaint against the English,
that they did help the Spaniards against the French the other day; and
that their Embassador do demand justice of our King, and that he do
resolve to be gone for France the next week; which I, and all that I
met with, are very glad of. Thence to Paternoster Row, where my Will did
receive the L50 I borrowed yesterday. I to the Wardrobe to dinner,
and there staid most of the afternoon very merry with the ladies. Then
Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there came too late, so we
staid and saw a bit of “Victoria,” which pleased me worse than it did
the other day. So we staid not to see it out, but went out and drank a
bottle or two of China ale, and so home, where I found my wife vexed at
her people for grumbling to eat Suffolk cheese, which I also am vexed
at. So to bed.
