17th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home to
dinner, and in the afternoon shut myself in my chamber, and there till
twelve at night finishing my great letter to the Duke of York, which do
lay the ill condition of the Navy so open to him, that it is impossible
if the King and he minds any thing of their business, but it will
operate upon them to set all matters right, and get money to carry on
the war, before it be too late, or else lay out for a peace upon any
termes. It was a great convenience to-night that what I had writ foule
in short hand, I could read to W. Hewer, and he take it fair in short
hand, so as I can read it to-morrow to Sir W. Coventry, and then come
home, and Hewer read it to me while I take it in long-hand to present,
which saves me much time. So to bed.
