16th. Up betimes, and to the Duke of Albemarle with an account of my
yesterdayâ€™s actions in writing. So back to the office, where all the
morning very busy. After dinner by coach to see and speak with Mr. Povy,
and after little discourse back again home, where busy upon letters till
past 12 at night, and so home to supper and to bed, weary.
