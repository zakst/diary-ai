21st. Till past one, Lordâ€™s day, in the morning writing letters to the
fleete and elsewhere, and my mind eased of much business, home to bed
and slept till 8. So up, and this day is brought home one of my new silk
suits, the plain one, but very rich camelott and noble. I tried it and
it pleases me, but did not wear it, being I would not go out today to
church. So laid it by, and my mind changed, thinking to go see my Lady
Sandwich, and I did go a little way, but stopped and returned home to
dinner, after dinner up to my chamber to settle my Tangier accounts,
and then to my office, there to do the like with other papers. In the
evening home to supper and to bed.
