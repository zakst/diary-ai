30th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay long, however up and to church, where Mills made
a good sermon. Here was a collection for the sexton; but it come into my
head why we should be more bold in making the collection while the
psalm is singing, than in the sermon or prayer. Home, and, without
any strangers, to dinner, and then all the afternoon and evening in my
chamber preparing all my accounts in good condition against to-morrow,
to state them for the whole year past, to which God give me a good issue
when I come to close them! So to supper and to bed.
