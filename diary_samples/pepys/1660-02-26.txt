26th. Thanks to God I got to bed in my own poor cabin, and slept well
till 9 o’clock this morning. Mr. North and Dr. Clerke and all the great
company being gone, I found myself very uncouth all this day for
want thereof. My Lord dined with the Vice-Admiral to-day (who is as
officious, poor man! as any spaniel can be; but I believe all to no
purpose, for I believe he will not hold his place), so I dined commander
at the coach table to-day, and all the officers of the ship with me, and
Mr. White of Dover. After a game or two at nine-pins, to work all the
afternoon, making above twenty orders. In the evening my Lord having
been a-shore, the first time that he hath been a-shore since he came out
of the Hope (having resolved not to go till he had brought his Majesty
into England), returned on board with a great deal of pleasure. I
supped with the Captain in his cabin with young Captain Cuttance, and
afterwards a messenger from the King came with a letter, and to go into
France, and by that means we supped again with him at 12 o’clock at
night. This night the Captain told me that my Lord had appointed me L30
out of the 1000 ducats which the King had given to the ship, at which my
heart was very much joyed. To bed.
