29th. Lay chiding, and then pleased with my wife in bed, and did
consent to her having a new waistcoate made her for that which she lost
yesterday. So to the office, and sat all the morning. At noon dined with
Mr. Coventry at Sir J. Minnes his lodgings, the first time that ever I
did yet, and am sorry for doing it now, because of obliging me to do the
like to him again. Here dined old Captn. Marsh of the Tower with us.
So to visit Sir W. Pen, and then to the office, and there late upon
business by myself, my wife being sick to-day. So home and to supper and
to bed.
