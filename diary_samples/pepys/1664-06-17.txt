17th. Up, and to my office, where I dispatched much business, and then
down by water to Woolwich to make a discovery of a cheate providing for
us in the working of some of our own ground Tows into new cordage, to be
sold to us for Riga cordage. Thence to Mr. Falconerâ€™s, where I met Sir
W. Batten and Lady, and Captain Tinker, and there dined with them,
and so to the Dockyarde and to Deptford by water, and there very long
informing myself in the business of flags and bewpers and other things,
and so home late, being weary, and full of good information to-day, but
I perceive the corruptions of the Navy are of so many kinds that it is
endless to look after them, especially while such a one as Sir W. Batten
discourages every man that is honest. So home to my office, there very
late, and then to supper and to bed mightily troubled in my mind to hear
how Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes do labour all they can to abuse or
enable others to abuse the King.
