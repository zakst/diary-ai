31st. This morning comes Prior of Brampton to me about the house he has
to buy of me, but I was forced to be at the office all the morning, and
so could not talk with him. And so, after the office was done, and dined
at home, I went to my brother Tom’s, and there met him. He demanded
some abatement, he having agreed with my father for Barton’s house, at a
price which I told him I could not meddle with, but that as for anything
to secure his title to them I was ready, and so we parted. Thence to
Sir Robert Bernard, and as his client did ask his advice about my uncle
Thomas’s case and ours as to Gravely, and in short he tells me that
there is little hopes of recovering it or saving his annuity, which do
trouble me much, but God’s will be done. Hence, with my mind full of
trouble, to my uncle Fenner’s, when at the alehouse I found him drinking
and very jolly and youthsome, and as one that I believe will in a little
time get a wife. So home.
