6th. Up, and to the office all the morning, where (which he hath not
done a great while) Sir G. Carteret come to advise with us for the
disposing of L10,000, which is the first sum the new Lords Treasurers
have provided us; but, unless we have more, this will not enable us to
cut off any of the growing charge which they seem to give it us for, and
expect we should discharge several ships quite off with it. So home and
with my father and wife to Sir W. Penâ€™s to dinner, which they invited us
to out of their respect to my father, as a stranger; though I know them
as false as the devil himself, and that it is only that they think it
fit to oblige me; wherein I am a happy man, that all my fellow-officers
are desirous of my friendship. Here as merry as in so false a place, and
where I must dissemble my hatred, I could be, and after dinner my father
and wife to a play, and I to my office, and there busy all the afternoon
till late at night, and then my wife and I sang a song or two in the
garden, and so home to supper and to bed. This afternoon comes Mr.
Pierce to me about some business, and tells me that the Duke of
Cambridge is yet living, but every minute expected to die, and is given
over by all people, which indeed is a sad loss.
