8th. Up early, my Lady Batten knocking at her door that comes into one
of my chambers. I did give directions to my people and workmen, and so
about 8 o’clock we took barge at the Tower, Sir William Batten and his
lady, Mrs. Turner, Mr. Fowler and I. A very pleasant passage and so to
Gravesend, where we dined, and from thence a coach took them and me,
and Mr. Fowler with some others came from Rochester to meet us, on
horseback. At Rochester, where alight at Mr. Alcock’s and there drank
and had good sport, with his bringing out so many sorts of cheese. Then
to the Hillhouse at Chatham, where I never was before, and I found a
pretty pleasant house and am pleased with the arms that hang up there.
Here we supped very merry, and late to bed; Sir William telling me that
old Edgeborrow, his predecessor, did die and walk in my chamber, did
make me some what afeard, but not so much as for mirth’s sake I did
seem. So to bed in the treasurer’s chamber.
