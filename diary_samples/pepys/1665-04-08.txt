8th. Up, and all the morning full of business at the office. At noon
dined with Mr. Povy, and then to the getting some business looked over
of his, and then I to my Lord Chancellorâ€™s, where to have spoke with the
Duke of Albemarle, but the King and Council busy, I could not; then
to the Old Exchange and there of my new pretty seamstress bought four
bands, and so home, where I found my house mighty neat and clean.
Then to my office late, till past 12, and so home to bed. The French
Embassadors

     [The French ambassadors were Henri de Bourbon, Duc de Verneuil,
     natural son of Henry IV. and brother of Henrietta Maria, and M. de
     Courtin.--B.]

are come incognito before their train, which will hereafter be very
pompous. It is thought they come to get our King to joyne with the King
of France in helping him against Flanders, and they to do the like to
us against Holland. We have laine a good while with a good fleete at
Harwich. The Dutch not said yet to be out. We, as high as we make our
shew, I am sure, are unable to set out another small fleete, if this
should be worsted. Wherefore, God send us peace! I cry.
