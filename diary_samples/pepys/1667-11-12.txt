12th. Up, and to the Office, where sat all the morning; and there hear
the Duke of York do yet do very well with his smallpox: pray God he may
continue to do so! This morning also, to my astonishment, I hear that
yesterday my Lord Chancellor, to another of his Articles, that of
betraying the Kingâ€™s councils to his enemies, is voted to have matter
against him for an impeachment of High Treason, and that this day the
impeachment is to be carried up to the House of Lords which is very
high, and I am troubled at it; for God knows what will follow, since
they that do this must do more to secure themselves against any that
will revenge this, if it ever come in their power! At noon home to
dinner, and then to my office, and there saw every thing finished, so as
my papers are all in order again and my office twice as pleasant as ever
it was, having a noble window in my closet and another in my office, to
my great content, and so did business late, and then home to supper and
to bed.
