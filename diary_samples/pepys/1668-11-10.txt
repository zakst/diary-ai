10th. Up, and my wife still every day as ill as she is all night, will
rise to see me out doors, telling me plainly that she dares not let me
see the girle, and so I out to the office, where all the morning, and so
home to dinner, where I found my wife mightily troubled again, more
than ever, and she tells me that it is from her examining the girle and
getting a confession now from her of all.... which do mightily trouble
me, as not being able to foresee the consequences of it, as to our
future peace together. So my wife would not go down to dinner, but I
would dine in her chamber with her, and there after mollifying her as
much as I could we were pretty quiet and eat, and by and by comes Mr.
Hollier, and dines there by himself after we had dined, and he being
gone, we to talk again, and she to be troubled, reproaching me with my
unkindness and perjury, I having denied my ever kissing her. As also
with all her old kindnesses to me, and my ill-using of her from the
beginning, and the many temptations she hath refused out of faithfulness
to me, whereof several she was particular in, and especially from
my Lord Sandwich, by the sollicitation of Captain Ferrers, and then
afterward the courtship of my Lord Hinchingbrooke, even to the trouble
of his lady. All which I did acknowledge and was troubled for, and wept,
and at last pretty good friends again, and so I to my office, and
there late, and so home to supper with her, and so to bed, where after
half-an-hourâ€™s slumber she wakes me and cries out that she should never
sleep more, and so kept raving till past midnight, that made me cry
and weep heartily all the while for her, and troubled for what
she reproached me with as before, and at last with new vows, and
particularly that I would myself bid the girle be gone, and shew
my dislike to her, which I will endeavour to perform, but with much
trouble, and so this appeasing her, we to sleep as well as we could till
morning.
