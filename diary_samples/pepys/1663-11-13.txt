13th. Up and to my office, busy all the morning with Commissioner
Pett; at noon I to the Exchange, and meeting Shales, he and I to the
Coffee-house and there talked of our victualling matters, which I fear
will come to little. However I will go on and carry it as far as I can.
So home to dinner where I expected Commissioner Pett, and had a good
dinner, but he came not. After dinner came my perriwigg-maker, and
brings me a second periwigg, made of my own haire, which comes to 21s.
