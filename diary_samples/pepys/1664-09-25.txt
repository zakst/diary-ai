25th (Lord’s day). Up, and my throat being yet very sore, and, my head
out of order, we went not to church, but I spent all the morning reading
of “The Madd Lovers,” a very good play, and at noon comes Harman and his
wife, whom I sent for to meet the Joyces, but they came not. It seems
Will has got a fall off his horse and broke his face. However, we were
as merry as I could in their company, and we had a good chine of beef,
but I had no taste nor stomach through my cold, and therefore little
pleased with my dinner. It raining, they sat talking with us all the
afternoon. So anon they went away; and then I to read another play, “The
Custome of the Country,” which is a very poor one, methinks. Then to
supper, prayers, and bed.
