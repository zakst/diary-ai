4th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and this
morning Sir W. Pen went to Chatham to look: after the ships now going
out thence, and particularly that wherein the Duke and himself go. He
took Sir G. Ascue with: him, whom, I believe, he hath brought into play.
At noon to the ‘Change and thence home, where I found my aunt James
and the two she joyces. They dined and were merry with us. Thence
after dinner to a play, to see “The Generall;” which is so dull and so
ill-acted, that I think it is the worst. I ever saw or heard in all my
days. I happened to sit near; to Sir Charles Sidly; who I find a very
witty man, and he did at every line take notice of the dullness of
the poet and badness of the action, that most pertinently; which I
was mightily taken with; and among others where by Altemire’s command
Clarimont, the Generall, is commanded to rescue his Rivall, whom she
loved, Lucidor, he, after a great deal of demurre, broke out; “Well,
I’le save my Rivall and make her confess, that I deserve, while he do
but possesse.” “Why, what, pox,” says Sir Charles Sydly, “would he
have him have more, or what is there more to be had of a woman than the
possessing her?” Thence-setting all them at home, I home with my wife
and Mercer, vexed at my losing my time and above 20s. in money, and
neglecting my business to see so bad a play. To-morrow they told us
should be acted, or the day after, a new play, called “The Parson’s
Dreame,” acted all by women. So to my office, and there did business;
and so home to supper and to bed.
