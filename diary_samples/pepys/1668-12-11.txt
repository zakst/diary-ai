11th. Up, and with W. Hewer by water to Somerset House; and there I to
my Lord Brouncker, before he went forth to the Duke of York, and there
told him my confidence that I should make Middleton appear a fool, and
that it was, I thought, best for me to complain of the wrong he hath
done; but brought it about, that my Lord desired me I would forbear, and
promised that he would prevent Middleton till I had given in my answer
to the Board, which I desired: and so away to White Hall, and there
did our usual attendance and no word spoke before the Duke of York by
Middleton at all; at which I was glad to my heart, because by this means
I have time to draw up my answer to my mind. So with W. Hewer by coach
to Smithfield, but met not Mr. Dickering, he being not come, and so he
[Will] and I to a cook’s shop, in Aldersgate Street; and dined well
for 19 1/2 d., upon roast beef, pleasing ourselves with the infinite
strength we have to prove Middleton a coxcomb; and so, having dined,
we back to Smithfield, and there met Dickering, and up and down all the
afternoon about horses, and did see the knaveries and tricks of jockeys.
Here I met W. Joyce, who troubled me with his impertinencies a great
while, and the like Mr. Knepp, who, it seems, is a kind of a jockey, and
would fain have been doing something for me, but I avoided him, and the
more for fear of being troubled thereby with his wife, whom I desire but
dare not see, for my vow to my wife. At last went away and did nothing,
only concluded upon giving L50 for a fine pair of black horses we saw
this day se’nnight; and so set Mr. Dickering down near his house, whom I
am much beholden to, for his care herein, and he hath admirable skill,
I perceive, in this business, and so home, and spent the evening talking
and merry, my mind at good ease, and so to bed.
