17th. Up, and to the office, where very busy all the morning, and then
in the afternoon I with Sir W. Pen and Sir T. Harvy to White Hall to
attend the Duke of York, who is now as well as ever, and there we did
our usual business with him, and so away home with Sir W. Pen, and there
to the office, where pretty late doing business, my wife having been
abroad all day with Mrs. Turner buying of one thing or other. This day
I do hear at White Hall that the Duke of Monmouth is sick, and in danger
of the smallpox. So home to supper and to bed.
