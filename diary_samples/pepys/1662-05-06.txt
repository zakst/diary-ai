6th. This morning I got my seat set up on the leads, which pleases me
well. So to the office, and thence to the Change, but could not meet
with my uncle Wight. So home to dinner and then out again to several
places to pay money and to understand my debts, and so home and walked
with my wife on the leads, and so to supper and to bed. I find it a hard
matter to settle to business after so much leisure and pleasure.
