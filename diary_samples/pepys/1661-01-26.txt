26th. Within all the morning. About noon comes one that had formerly
known me and I him, but I know not his name, to borrow L5 of me, but I
had the wit to deny him. There dined with me this day both the Piercesâ€™
and their wives, and Captain Cuttance, and Lieutenant Lambert, with whom
we made ourselves very merry by taking away his ribbans and garters,
having made him to confess that he is lately married. The company being
gone I went to my lute till night, and so to bed.
