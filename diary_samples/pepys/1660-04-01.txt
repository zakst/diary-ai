April 1st (Lord’s day). Mr. Ibbott preached very well. After dinner my
Lord did give me a private list of all the ships that were to be set out
this summer, wherein I do discern that he bath made it his care to put
by as much of the Anabaptists as he can. By reason of my Lord and my
being busy to send away the packet by Mr. Cooke of the Nazeby, it was
four o’clock before we could begin sermon again. This day Captain Guy
come on board from Dunkirk, who tells me that the King will come in, and
that the soldiers at Dunkirk do drink the King’s health in the streets.
At night the Captain, Sir R. Stayner, Mr. Sheply, and I did sup together
in the Captain’s cabin. I made a commission for Captain Wilgness, of
the Bear, to-night, which got me 30s. So after writing a while I went to
bed.
