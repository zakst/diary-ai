26th. Up, and walked all the way (it being a most fine frost), to White
Hall, to Sir W. Coventry’s chamber, and thence with him up to the
Duke of York, where among other things at our meeting I did offer my
assistance to Sir J. Minnes to do the business of his office, relating
to the Pursers’ accounts, which was well accepted by the Duke of York,
and I think I have and shall do myself good in it, if it be taken, for
it will confirm me in the business of the victualling office, which I do
now very little for. Thence home, carrying a barrel of oysters with me.
Anon comes Mr. John Andrews and his wife by invitation from Bow to dine
with me, and young Batelier and his wife with her great belly, which has
spoiled her looks mightily already. Here was also Mercer and Creed,
whom I met coming home, who tells me of a most bitter lampoone now out
against the Court and the management of State from head to foot, mighty
witty and mighty severe. By and by to dinner, a very good one, and
merry. After dinner I put the women into a coach, and they to the Duke’s
house, to a play which was acted, “The--------.” It was indifferently
done, but was not pleased with the song, Gosnell not singing, but a new
wench, that sings naughtily. Thence home, all by coach, and there Mr.
Andrews to the vyall, who plays most excellently on it, which I did
not know before. Then to dance, here being Pembleton come, by my wife’s
direction, and a fiddler; and we got, also, the elder Batelier to-night,
and Nan Wright, and mighty merry we were, and I danced; and so till
twelve at night, and to supper, and then to cross purposes, mighty
merry, and then to bed, my eyes being sore. Creed lay here in Barker’s
bed.
