18th. Up and within all the morning, being willing to keep as much as
I could within doors, but receiving a very wakening letter from Mr.
Coventry about fitting of ships, which speaks something like to be done,
I went forth to the office, there to take order in things, and after
dinner to White Hall to a Committee of Tangier, but did little. So home
again and to Sir W. Pen, who, among other things of haste in this new
order for ships, is ordered to be gone presently to Portsmouth to look
after the work there. I staid to discourse with him, and so home to
supper, where upon a fine couple of pigeons, a good supper; and here I
met a pretty cabinet sent me by Mr. Shales, which I give my wife, the
first of that sort of goods I ever had yet, and very conveniently it
comes for her closett. I staid up late finding out the private boxes,
but could not do some of them, and so to bed, afraid that I have been
too bold to-day in venturing in the cold. This day I begun to drink
butter-milke and whey, and I hope to find great good by it.
