1667, became the wife of the Earl of Rochester, then not twenty
     years old, no authentic portrait is known to exist.  When Mr.
     Miller, of Albemarle Street, in 1811, proposed to publish an edition
     of the “Memoires de Grammont,” he sent an artist to Windsor to copy
     there the portraits which he could find of those who figure in that
     work.  In the list given to him for this purpose was the name of
     Lady Rochester.  Not finding amongst the “Beauties,” or elsewhere,
     any genuine portrait of her, but seeing that by Hamilton she is
     absurdly styled “une triste heritiere,” the artist made a drawing
     from some unknown portrait at Windsor of a lady of a sorrowful
     countenance, and palmed it off upon the bookseller.  In the edition
     of “Grammont” it is not actually called Lady Rochester, but “La
     Triste Heritiere.”  A similar falsification had been practised in
     Edwards’s edition of 1793, but a different portrait had been copied.
     It is needless, almost, to remark how ill applied is Hamilton’s
     epithet.--B.]
