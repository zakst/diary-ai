4th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, and then up and to my office, there
to dispatch a business in order to the getting something out of the
Tangier business, wherein I have an opportunity to get myself paid upon
the score of freight. I hope a good sum. At noon home to dinner, and
then in the afternoon to church. So home, and by and by comes Mr. Hill
and Andrews, and sung together long and with great content. Then to
supper and broke up. Pretty discourse, very pleasant and ingenious, and
so to my office a little, and then home (after prayers) to bed. This day
I hear the Duke of Yorke is come to towne, though expected last night,
as I observed, but by what hindrance stopped I can’t tell.
