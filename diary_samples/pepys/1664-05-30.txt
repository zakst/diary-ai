30th. Lay long, the bells ringing, it being holiday, and then up and
all the day long in my study at home studying of shipmaking with great
content till the evening, and then came Mr. Howe and sat and then supped
with me. He is a little conceited, but will make a discreet man. He
being gone, a little to my office, and then home to bed, being in much
pain from yesterdayâ€™s being abroad, which is a consideration of mighty
sorrow to me.
