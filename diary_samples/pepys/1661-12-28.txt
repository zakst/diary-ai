28th. At home all the morning; and in the afternoon all of us at the
office, upon a letter from the Duke for the making up of a speedy
estimate of all the debts of the Navy, which is put into good
forwardness. I home and Sir W. Pen to my house, who with his children
staid playing cards late, and so to bed.
