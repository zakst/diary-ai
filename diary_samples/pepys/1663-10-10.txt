10th. Up, and not in any good ease yet, but had pain in making water,
and some course. I see I must take besides keeping myself warm to make
myself break wind and go freely to stool before I can be well, neither
of which I can do yet, though I have drank the other bottle of Mr.
Hollyard’s against my stomach this morning. I did, however, make shift
to go to the office, where we sat, and there Sir J. Minnes and Sir W.
Batten did advise me to take some juniper water, and Sir W. Batten sent
to his Lady for some for me, strong water made of juniper. Whether that
or anything else of my draught this morning did it I cannot tell, but
I had a couple of stools forced after it.... but whether I shall grow
better upon it I cannot tell. Dined at home at noon, my wife and house
in the dirtiest pickle that ever she and it was in almost, but in order,
I hope, this night to be very clean. To the office all the afternoon
upon victualling business, and late at it, so after I wrote by the post
to my father, I home. This evening Mr. Hollyard sends me an electuary
to take (a walnut quantity of it) going to bed, which I did. ‘Tis true I
slept well, and rose in a little ease in the morning.
