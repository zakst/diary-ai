12th. My wife had a very troublesome night this night and in great pain,
but about the morning her swelling broke, and she was in great ease
presently as she useth to be. So I put in a vent (which Dr. Williams
sent me yesterday) into the hole to keep it open till all the matter
be come out, and so I question not that she will soon be well again.
I staid at home all this morning, being the Lord’s day, making up my
private accounts and setting papers in order. At noon went with my Lady
Montagu at the Wardrobe, but I found it so late that I came back again,
and so dined with my wife in her chamber. After dinner I went awhile
to my chamber to set my papers right. Then I walked forth towards
Westminster and at the Savoy heard Dr. Fuller preach upon David’s words,
“I will wait with patience all the days of my appointed time until my
change comes;” but methought it was a poor dry sermon. And I am afeard
my former high esteem of his preaching was more out of opinion than
judgment. From thence homewards, but met with Mr. Creed, with whom I
went and walked in Grayes-Inn-walks, and from thence to Islington, and
there eat and drank at the house my father and we were wont of old to go
to; and after that walked homeward, and parted in Smithfield: and so I
home, much wondering to see how things are altered with Mr. Creed, who,
twelve months ago, might have been got to hang himself almost as soon as
go to a drinking-house on a Sunday.
