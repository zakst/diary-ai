2nd (Lord’s day). With my mind much eased talking long in bed with my
wife about our frugall life for the time to come, proposing to her what
I could and would do if I were worth L2,000, that is, be a knight, and
keep my coach, which pleased her,

     [Lord Braybrooke wrote, “This reminds me of a story of my father’s,
     when he was of Merton College, and heard Bowen the porter wish that
     he had L100 a-year, to enable him to keep a couple of hunters and a
     pack of foxhounds.”]

and so I do hope we shall hereafter live to save something, for I
am resolved to keep myself by rules from expenses. To church in the
morning: none in the pew but myself. So home to dinner, and after
dinner came Sir William and talked with me till church time, and then to
church, where at our going out I was at a loss by Sir W. Pen’s putting
me upon it whether to take my wife or Mrs. Martha (who alone was there),
and I began to take my wife, but he jogged me, and so I took Martha, and
led her down before him and my wife. So set her at home, and Sir William
and my wife and I to walk in the garden, and anon hearing that Sir G.
Carteret had sent to see whether we were at home or no, Sir William
and I went to his house, where we waited a good while, they being at
prayers, and by and by we went up to him; there the business was about
hastening the East India ships, about which we are to meet to-morrow in
the afternoon. So home to my house, and Sir William supped with me, and
so to bed.
