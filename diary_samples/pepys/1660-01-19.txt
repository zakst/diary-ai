19th. Called on betimes by Murford, who showed me five pieces to get a
business done for him and I am resolved to do it., Much business at my
Lord’s. This morning my Lord went into the House of Commons, and there
had the thanks of the House, in the name of the Parliament and Commons
of England, for his late service to his King and Country. A motion was
made for a reward for him, but it was quashed by Mr. Annesly, who, above
most men, is engaged to my Lord’s and Mr. Crew’s families. Meeting with
Captain Stoakes at Whitehall, I dined with him and Mr. Gullop, a
parson (with whom afterwards I was much offended at his importunity and
impertinence, such another as Elborough),

     [Thomas Elborough was one of Pepys’s schoolfellows, and afterwards
     curate of St. Lawrence Poultney.]

and Mr. Butler, who complimented much after the same manner as the
parson did. After that towards my Lord’s at Mr. Crew’s, but was met with
by a servant of my Lady Pickering, who took me to her and she told me
the story of her husband’s case and desired my assistance with my Lord,
and did give me, wrapped up in paper, L5 in silver. After that to my
Lord’s, and with him to Whitehall and my Lady Pickering. My Lord went
at night with the King to Baynard’s Castle’ to supper, and I home to my
father’s to bed. My wife and the girl and dog came home to-day. When I
came home I found a quantity of chocolate left for me, I know not from
whom. We hear of W. Howe being sick to-day, but he was well at night.
