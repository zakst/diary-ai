20th. We sat at the office this morning, Sir W. Batten and Mr. Pett
being upon a survey to Chatham. This morning I sent my wife to my
father’s and he is to give me L5 worth of pewter. After we rose at the
office, I went to my father’s, where my Uncle Fenner and all his crew
and Captain Holland and his wife and my wife were at dinner at a venison
pasty of the venison that I did give my mother the other day. I did this
time show so much coldness to W. Joyce that I believe all the table took
notice of it. After that to Westminster about my Lord’s business and so
home, my Lord having not been well these two or three days, and I hear
that Mr. Barnwell at Hinchinbroke is fallen sick again. Home and to bed.
