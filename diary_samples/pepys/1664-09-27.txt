27th. Lay long, sleeping, it raining and blowing very hard. Then up and
to the office, my mouth still being scabby and a patch on it. At the
office all the morning. At noon dined at home, and so after dinner
(Lewellin dining with me and in my way talking about Deering) to the
Fishing Committee, and had there very many fine things argued, and I
hope some good will cone of it. So home, where my wife having (after all
her merry discourse of being with child) her months upon her is gone to
bed. I to my office very late doing business, then home to supper and
to bed. To-night Mr. T. Trice and Piggot came to see me, and desire my
going down to Brampton Court, where for Piggotâ€™s sake, for whom it is
necessary, I should go, I would be glad to go, and will, contrary to my
purpose, endeavour it, but having now almost L1000, if not above, in my
house, I know not what to do with it, and that will trouble my mind to
leave in the house, and I not at home.
