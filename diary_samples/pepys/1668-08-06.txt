6th. Waked betimes, and my wife, at an hour’s warning, is resolved to
go with me, which pleases me, her readiness. But, before ready, comes a
letter from Fitzgerald, that he is seized upon last night by an order
of the General’s by a file of musqueteers, and kept prisoner in his
chamber. The Duke of York did tell me of it to-day: it is about a
quarrel between him and Witham, and they fear a challenge: so I to him,
and sent my wife by the coach round to Lambeth. I lost my labour going
to his lodgings, and he in bed: and, staying a great while for him, I at
last grew impatient, and would stay no longer; but to St. James’s to Mr.
Wren, to bid him “God be with you!” and so over the water to Fox Hall;
and there my wife and Deb. come and took me up, and we away to Gilford,
losing our way for three or four mile, about Cobham. At Gilford we
dined; and, I shewed them the hospitall there of Bishop Abbot’s, and
his tomb in the church, which, and the rest of the tombs there, are kept
mighty clean and neat, with curtains before them. So to coach again, and
got to Lippock,2 late over Hindhead, having an old man, a guide, in the
coach with us; but got thither with great fear of being out of our way,
it being ten at night. Here good, honest people; and after supper, to
bed....
