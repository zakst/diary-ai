18th. Up and to the office, where Mr. Phillip the lawyer came to me, but
I put him off to the afternoon. At noon I dined at Sir W. Batten’s, Sir
John Minnes being here, and he and I very kind, but I every day expect
to pull a crow with him about our lodgings. My mind troubled about
Gosnell and my law businesses. So after dinner to Mr. Phillips his
chamber, where he demands an abatement for Piggott’s money, which vexes
me also, but I will not give it him without my father’s consent, which
I will write to him to-night about, and have done it. Here meeting my
uncle Thomas, he and I to my cozen Roger’s chamber, and there I did give
my uncle him and Mr. Philips to be my two arbiters against Mr. Cole and
Punt, but I expect no great good of the matter. Thence walked home, and
my wife came home, having been abroad to-day, laying out above L12 in
linen, and a copper, and a pot, and bedstead, and other household stuff,
which troubles me also, so that my mind to-night is very heavy and
divided. Late at my office, drawing up a letter to my Lord Treasurer,
which we have been long about, and so home, and, my mind troubled, to
bed.
