20th. At the office all the morning, dined at home and Mr. Creed and Mr.
Shepley with me, and after dinner we did a good deal of business in
my study about my Lord’s accounts to be made up and presented to our
office. That done to White Hall to Mr. Coventry, where I did some
business with him, and so with Sir W. Pen (who I found with Mr. Coventry
teaching of him upon the map to understand Jamaica).

     [Sir William Penn was well fitted to give this information, as it
     was he who took the island from the Spaniards in 1655.]

By water in the dark home, and so to my Lady Batten’s where my wife was,
and there we sat and eat and drank till very late, and so home to bed.
The great talk of the town is the strange election that the City of
London made yesterday for Parliament-men; viz. Fowke, Love, Jones,
and... men that are so far from being episcopall that they are thought
to be Anabaptists; and chosen with a great deal of zeal, in spite of
the other party that thought themselves very strong, calling out in the
Hall, “No Bishops! no Lord Bishops!” It do make people to fear it may
come to worse, by being an example to the country to do the same. And
indeed the Bishops are so high, that very few do love them.
