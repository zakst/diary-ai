17th (Lord’s day). All the morning at my office doing business there, it
raining hard. So dined at home alone. After dinner walked to my Lord’s,
and there found him and much other guests at table at dinner, and it
seems they have christened his young son to-day-called him James. I got
a piece of cake. I got my Lord to signe and seale my business about my
selling of Brampton land, which though not so full as I would, yet is as
full as I can at present. Walked home again, and there fell to read, and
by and by comes my uncle Wight, Dr. Burnett, and another gentleman,
and talked and drank, and the Doctor showed me the manner of eating,
turpentine, which pleases me well, for it is with great ease. So they
being gone, I to supper and to bed.
