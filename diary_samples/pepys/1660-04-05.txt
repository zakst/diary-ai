5th. Infinity of business all the morning of orders to make, that I
was very much perplexed that Mr. Burr had failed me of coming back last
night, and we ready to set sail, which we did about noon, and came in
the evening to Lee roads and anchored. At night Mr. Sheply overtook us
who had been at Grayâ€™s Market this morning. I spent all the afternoon
upon the deck, it being very pleasant weather. This afternoon Sir Rich.
Stayner and Mr. Creed, after we were come to anchor, did come on board,
and Creed brought me L30, which my Lord had ordered him to pay me upon
account, and Captain Clerke brought me a noted caudle. At night very
sleepy to bed.
