15th. Called up in the morning by Captain Holland and Captain Cuttance,
and with them to Harper’s, thence to my office, thence with Mr. Hill of
Worcestershire to Will’s, where I gave him a letter to Nan Pepys, and
some merry pamphlets against the Rump to carry to her into the country.
So to Mr. Crew’s, where the dining room being full, Mr. Walgrave and
I dined below in the buttery by ourselves upon a good dish of buttered
salmon. Thence to Hering’ the merchant about my Lord’s Worcester money
and back to Paul’s Churchyard, where I staid reading in Fuller’s History
of the Church of England an hour or two, and so to my father’s, where
Mr. Hill came to me and I gave him direction what to do at Worcester
about the money. Thence to my Lady Wright’s and gave her a letter from
my Lord privily. So to Mrs. Jem and sat with her, who dined at Mr.
Crew’s to-day, and told me that there was at her coming away at least
forty gentlemen (I suppose members that were secluded, for Mr. Walgrave
told me that there were about thirty met there the last night) came
dropping in one after another thither. Thence home and wrote into the
country against to-morrow by the carrier and so to bed. At my father’s
I heard how my cousin Kate Joyce had a fall yesterday from her horse
and had some hurt thereby. No news to-day, but all quiet to see what the
Parliament will do about the issuing of the writs to-morrow for filling
up of the House, according to Monk’s desire.
