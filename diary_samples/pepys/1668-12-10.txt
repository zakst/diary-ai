10th. Up, and to the Office, where busy all the morning: Middleton not
there, so no words or looks of him. At noon, home to dinner; and so to
the Office, and there all the afternoon busy; and at night W. Hewer home
with me; and we think we have got matter enough to make Middleton appear
a coxcomb. But it troubled me to have Sir W. Warren meet me at night,
going out of the Office home, and tell me that Middleton do intend to
complain to the Duke of York: but, upon consideration of the business, I
did go to bed, satisfied that it was best for me that he should; and so
my trouble was over, and to bed, and slept well.
