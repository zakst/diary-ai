10th (Lord’s day). Lay long talking, Hill and I, with great pleasure,
and then up, and being ready walked to Cocke’s for some newes, but heard
none, only they would have us stay their dinner, and sent for my wife,
who come, and very merry we were, there being Sir Edmund Pooly and Mr.
Evelyn. Before we had dined comes Mr. Andrews, whom we had sent for to
Bow, and so after dinner home, and there we sang some things, but not
with much pleasure, Mr. Andrews being in so great haste to go home, his
wife looking every hour to be brought to bed. He gone Mr. Hill and I
continued our musique, one thing after another, late till supper, and so
to bed with great pleasure.
