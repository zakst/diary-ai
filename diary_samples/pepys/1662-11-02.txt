2nd (Lord’s day). Lay long with pleasure talking with my wife, in whom I
never had greater content, blessed be God! than now, she continuing
with the same care and thrift and innocence, so long as I keep her from
occasions of being otherwise, as ever she was in her life, and keeps
the house as well. To church, where Mr. Mills, after he had read the
service, and shifted himself as he did the last day, preached a very
ordinary sermon. So home to dinner with my wife. Then up into my new
rooms which are, almost finished, and there walked with great content
talking with my wife till church time, and then to church, and there
being a lazy preacher I slept out the sermon, and so home, and after
visiting the two Sir Williams, who are both of them mending apace, I to
my office preparing things against to-morrow for the Duke, and so home
and to bed, with some pain,... having taken cold this morning in sitting
too long bare-legged to pare my corns. My wife and I spent a good deal
of this evening in reading “Du Bartas’ Imposture” and other parts which
my wife of late has taken up to read, and is very fine as anything I
meet with.
