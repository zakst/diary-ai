29th. Called up by my Lady Peterborough’s servant about some business of
hers, and so to the office. Thence by and by with Sir J. Minnes toward
St. James’s, and I stop at Dr. Turberville’s, and there did receive a
direction for some physic, and also a glass of something to drop into my
eyes: who gives me hopes that I may do well. Thence to St. James’s,
and thence to White Hall, where I find the Duke of York in the
Council-chamber; where the Officers of the Navy were called in about
Navy business, about calling in of more ships; the King of France
having, as the Duke of York says, ordered his fleete to come in,
notwithstanding what he had lately ordered for their staying abroad.
Thence to the Chapel, it being St. Peter’s day, and did hear an anthem
of Silas Taylor’s making; a dull, old-fashioned thing, of six and seven
parts, that nobody could understand: and the Duke of York, when he come
out, told me that he was a better store-keeper than anthem-maker, and
that was bad enough, too. This morning Mr. May’ shewed me the King’s
new buildings at White Hall, very fine; and among other things, his
ceilings, and his houses of office. So home to dinner, and then with my
wife to the King’s playhouse--“The Mulberry Garden,” which she had not
seen. So by coach to Islington, and round by Hackney home with much
pleasure, and to supper and bed.
