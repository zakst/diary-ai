17th (Lord’s day). Up, and put on my new stuff-suit, with a
shoulder-belt, according to the new fashion, and the bands of my vest
and tunique laced with silk lace, of the colour of my suit: and so, very
handsome, to Church, where a dull sermon and of a stranger, and so home;
and there I find W. Howe, and a younger brother of his, come to dine
with me; and there comes Mercer, and brings with her Mrs. Gayet, which
pleased me mightily; and here was also W. Hewer, and mighty merry; and
after dinner to sing psalms. But, Lord! to hear what an excellent base
this younger brother of W. Howe’s sings, even to my astonishment, and
mighty pleasant. By and by Gayet goes away, being a Catholick, to
her devotions, and Mercer to church; but we continuing an hour or two
singing, and so parted; and I to Sir W. Pen’s, and there sent for a
hackney-coach; and he and she [Lady Pen] and I out, to take the gyre. We
went to Stepney, and there stopped at the Trinity House, he to talk
with the servants there against to-morrow, which is a great day for the
choice of a new Master, and thence to Mile End, and there eat and
drank, and so home; and I supped with them--that is, eat some butter and
radishes, which is my excuse for not eating any other of their victuals,
which I hate, because of their sluttery: and so home, and made my boy
read to me part of Dr. Wilkins’s new book of the “Real Character;” and
so to bed.
