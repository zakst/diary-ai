19th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon, eating
very little dinner, my wife and I by hackney to the King’s playhouse,
and there, the pit being full, satin a box above, and saw “Catiline’s
Conspiracy,” yesterday being the first day: a play of much good sense
and words to read, but that do appear the worst upon the stage, I mean,
the least diverting, that ever I saw any, though most fine in clothes;
and a fine scene of the Senate, and of a fight, that ever I saw in
my life. But the play is only to be read, and therefore home, with no
pleasure at all, but only in sitting next to Betty Hall, that did belong
to this house, and was Sir Philip Howard’s mistress; a mighty pretty
wench, though my wife will not think so; and I dare neither commend, nor
be seen to look upon her, or any other now, for fear of offending her.
So, our own coach coming for us, home, and to end letters, and so home,
my wife to read to me out of “The Siege of Rhodes,” and so to supper,
and to bed.
