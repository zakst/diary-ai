1s. 6d., which he sayth will serve me two years, but I fear it. He being
gone, I to my office, and put on my new shagg purple gowne, with gold
buttons and loop lace, I being a little fearful of taking cold and of
pain coming upon me. Here I staid making an end of a troublesome letter,
but to my advantage, against Sir W. Batten, giving Sir G. Carteret an
account of our late great contract with Sir W. Warren for masts, wherein
I am sure I did the King L600 service. That done home to my wife to take
a clyster, which I did, and it wrought very well and brought a great
deal of wind, which I perceive is all that do trouble me. After that,
about 9 or 10 o’clock, to supper in my wife’s chamber, and then about 12
to bed.
