19th. Up, and to the office all the morning. At noon took Mr. Deane
(lately come to towne) home with me to dinner, and there after giving
him some reprimands and good advice about his deportment in the place
where by my interest he is at Harwich, and then declaring my resolution
of being his friend still, we did then fall to discourse about his ship
“Rupert,” built by him there, which succeeds so well as he hath got
great honour by it, and I some by recommending him; the King, Duke, and
every body saying it is the best ship that was ever built. And then he
fell to explain to me his manner of casting the draught of water which a
ship will draw before-hand: which is a secret the King and all admire in
him; and he is the first that hath come to any certainty before-hand,
of foretelling the draught of water of a ship before she be launched. I
must confess I am much pleased in his successe in this business, and do
admire at the confidence of Castle who did undervalue the draught Deane
sent up to me, that I was ashamed to owne it or him, Castle asking of me
upon the first sight of it whether he that laid it down had ever built a
ship or no, which made me the more doubtfull of him. He being gone, I to
the office, where much business and many persons to speake with me. Late
home and to bed, glad to be at a little quiett.
