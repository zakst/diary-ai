23rd. All the morning very busy getting my packet ready for London, only
for an hour or two had the Captain and Mr. Sheply in my cabin at the
barrel of pickled oysters that the Captain did give me on Saturday last.
After dinner I sent Mr. Dunn to London with the packet. This afternoon
I had 40s. given me by Captain Cowes of the Paradox.’ In the evening the
first time that we had any sport among the seamen, and indeed there was
extraordinary good sport after my Lord had done playing at ninepins.
After that W. Howe and I went to play two trebles in the great
cabin below, which my Lord hearing, after supper he called for our
instruments, and played a set of Lock’s, two trebles, and a base, and
that being done, he fell to singing of a song made upon the Rump, with
which he played himself well, to the tune of “The Blacksmith.” After all
that done, then to bed.

     [“The Blacksmith” was the same tune as “Green Sleeves.”  The
     earliest known copy of “The Praise of the Blacksmith” is in “An
     Antidote against Melancholy,” 1661.  See “Roxburghe Ballads,” ed.
     W. Chappell, 1872, vol. ii.  p. 126.  (Ballad Society:)]
