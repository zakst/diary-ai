13th. Up by five o’clock and to my office, where hard at work till
towards noon, and home and eat a bit, and so going out met with Mr.
Mount my old acquaintance, and took him in and drank a glass or two of
wine to him and so parted, having not time to talk together, and I with
Sir W. Batten to the Stillyard, and there eat a lobster together, and
Wyse the King’s fishmonger coming in we were very merry half an hour,
and so by water to Whitehall, and by and by being all met we went in to
the Duke and there did our business and so away, and anon to the Tangier
Committee, where we had very fine discourse from Dr. Walker and Wiseman,
civilians, against our erecting a court-merchant at Tangier, and well
answered in many things by my Lord Sandwich (whose speaking I never till
now observed so much to be very good) and Sir R. Ford. By and by the
discourse being ended, we fell to my Lord Rutherford’s dispatch, which
do not please him, he being a Scott, and one resolved to scrape every
penny that he can get by any way, which the Committee will not agree to.
He took offence at something and rose away, without taking leave of the
board, which all took ill, though nothing said but only by the Duke of
Albemarle, who said that we ought to settle things as they ought to be,
and if he will not go upon these terms another man will, no doubt.
Here late, quite finishing things against his going, and so rose, and I
walked home, being accompanied by Creed to Temple Bar, talking of this
afternoon’s passage, and so I called at the Wardrobe in my way home,
and there spoke at the Horn tavern with Mr. Moore a word or two, but
my business was with Mr. Townsend, who is gone this day to his country
house, about sparing Charles Pepys some money of his bills due to him
when he can, but missing him lost my labour. So walked home, finding my
wife abroad, at my aunt, Wight’s, who coming home by and by, I home to
supper and to bed.
