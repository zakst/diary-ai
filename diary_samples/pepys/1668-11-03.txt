3rd. Up, and all the morning at the Office. At noon to dinner, and then
to the Office, and there busy till 12 at night, without much pain to my
eyes, but I did not use them to read or write, and so did hold out very
well. So home, and there to supper, and I observed my wife to eye my
eyes whether I did ever look upon Deb., which I could not but do now and
then (and to my grief did see the poor wretch look on me and see me look
on her, and then let drop a tear or two, which do make my heart relent
at this minute that I am writing this with great trouble of mind, for
she is indeed my sacrifice, poor girle); and my wife did tell me in bed
by the by of my looking on other people, and that the only way is to put
things out of sight, and this I know she means by Deb., for she tells me
that her Aunt was here on Monday, and she did tell her of her desire of
parting with Deb., but in such kind terms on both sides that my wife is
mightily taken with her. I see it will be, and it is but necessary, and
therefore, though it cannot but grieve me, yet I must bring my mind to
give way to it. We had a great deal of do this day at the Office about
Clutterbucke,--[See note to February 4th, 1663-64]--I declaring my
dissent against the whole Boardâ€™s proceedings, and I believe I shall
go near to shew W. Pen a very knave in it, whatever I find my Lord
Brouncker.
