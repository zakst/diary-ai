10th. Up and to the office. From thence, before we sat, Sir W. Pen sent
for me to his bedside to talk (indeed to reproach me with my not owning
to Sir J. Minnes that he had my advice in the blocking up of the garden
door the other day, which is now by him out of fear to Sir J. Minnes
opened again), to which I answered him so indifferently that I think he
and I shall be at a distance, at least to one another, better than ever
we did and love one another less, which for my part I think I need not
care for. So to the office, and sat till noon, then rose and to dinner,
and then to the office again, where Mr. Creed sat with me till late
talking very good discourse, as he is full of it, though a cunning knave
in his heart, at least not to be too much trusted, till Sir J. Minnes
came in, which at last he did, and so beyond my expectation he was
willing to sign his accounts, notwithstanding all his objections, which
really were very material, and yet how like a doting coxcomb he
signs the accounts without the least satisfaction, for which we both
sufficiently laughed at him and Sir W. Batten after they had signed them
and were gone, and so sat talking together till 11 oâ€™clock at night, and
so home and to bed.
