26th. Up, and with Middleton all the morning at the Docke, looking over
the storehouses and Commissioner Pett’s house, in order to Captain Cox’s
coming to live there in his stead, as Commissioner. But it is a mighty
pretty house; and pretty to see how every thing is said to be out of
repair for this new man, though L10 would put it into as good condition
in every thing as it ever was in, so free every body is of the King’s
money. By and by to Mr. Wilson’s, and there drank, but did not see his
wife, nor any woman in the yard, and so to dinner at the Hill-House; and
after dinner, till eight at night, close, Middleton and I, examining
the business of Mr. Pett, about selling a boat, and we find him a very
knave; and some other quarrels of his, wherein, to justify himself, he
hath made complaints of others. This being done, we to supper, and so to
talk, Commissioner Middleton being mighty good company upon a journey,
and so to bed, thinking how merry my people are at this time, putting
Tom and Jane to bed, being to have been married this day, it being also
my feast for my being cut of the stone, but how many years I do not
remember, but I think it to be about ten or eleven.
