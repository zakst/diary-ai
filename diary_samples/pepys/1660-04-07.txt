7th. This day, about nine o’clock in the morning, the wind grew high,
and we being among the sands lay at anchor; I began to be dizzy and
squeamish. Before dinner my Lord sent for me down to eat some oysters,
the best my Lord said that ever he ate in his life, though I have ate as
good at Bardsey. After dinner, and all the afternoon I walked upon the
deck to keep myself from being sick, and at last about five o’clock,
went to bed and got a caudle made me, and sleep upon it very well. This
day Mr. Sheply went to Sheppy.
