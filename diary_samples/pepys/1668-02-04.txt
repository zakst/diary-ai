4th. Up, and to the office, where a full Board sat all the morning, busy
among other things concerning a solemn letter we intend to write to
the Duke of York about the state of the things of the Navy, for want
of money, though I doubt it will be to little purpose. After dinner I
abroad by coach to Kate Joyce’s, where the jury did sit where they
did before, about her husband’s death, and their verdict put off for
fourteen days longer, at the suit of somebody, under pretence of the
King; but it is only to get money out of her to compound the matter. But
the truth is, something they will make out of Stillingfleete’s sermon,
which may trouble us, he declaring, like a fool, in his pulpit, that he
did confess that his losses in the world did make him do what he did.
This do vex me to see how foolish our Protestant Divines are, while the
Papists do make it the duty of Confessor to be secret, or else nobody
would confess their sins to them. All being put off for to-day, I took
my leave of Kate, who is mightily troubled at it for her estate sake,
not for her husband; for her sorrow for that, I perceive, is all over. I
home, and, there to my office busy till the evening, and then home, and
there my wife and Deb. and I and Betty Turner, I employed in the putting
new titles to my books, which we proceeded on till midnight, and then
being weary and late to bed.
