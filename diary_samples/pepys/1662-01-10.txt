10th. To White Hall, and there spoke with Sir Paul Neale’ about a
mathematical request of my Lord’s to him, which I did deliver to
him, and he promised to employ somebody to answer it, something about
observation of the moon and stars, but what I did not mind. Here I met
with Mr. Moore, who tells me that an injuncon is granted in Chancery
against T. Trice, at which I was very glad, being before in some trouble
for it. With him to Westminster Hall, where I walked till noon talking
with one or other, and so to the Wardrobe to dinner, where tired with
Mr. Pickering’s company I returned to Westminster, by appointment, to
meet my wife at Mrs. Hunt’s to gossip with her, which we did alone,
and were very merry, and did give her a cup and spoon for my wife’s
god-child, and so home by coach, and I late reading in my chamber and
then to bed, my wife being angry that I keep the house so late up.
