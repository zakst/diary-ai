9th. Lay long in bed this morning though an office day, because of our
going to bed late last night. Before I went to my office Mr. Creed came
to me about business, and also Mr. Carter, my old Cambridge friend, came
to give me a visit, and I did give them a morning draught in my study.
So to the office, and from thence to dinner with Mr. Wivell at the
Hoop Tavern, where we had Mr. Shepley, Talbot, Adams, Mr. Chaplin and
Osborne, and our dinner given us by Mr. Ady and another, Mr. Wine, the
King’s fishmonger. Good sport with Mr. Talbot, who eats no sort of fish,
and there was nothing else till we sent for a neat’s tongue. From thence
to Whitehall where I found my Lord, who had an organ set up to-day in
his dining-room, but it seems an ugly one in the form of Bridewell.
Thence I went to Sir Harry Wright’s, where my Lord was busy at cards,
and so I staid below with Mrs. Carter and Evans (who did give me a
lesson upon the lute), till he came down, and having talked with him
at the door about his late business of money, I went to my father’s and
staid late talking with my father about my sister Pall’s coming to live
with me if she would come and be as a servant (which my wife did seem to
be pretty willing to do to-day), and he seems to take it very well, and
intends to consider of it. Home and to bed.
