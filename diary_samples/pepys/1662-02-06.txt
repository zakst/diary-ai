6th. At my musique practice, and so into my cellar to my workmen, and I
am very much pleased with my alteracon there. About noon comes my uncle
Thomas to me to ask for his annuity, and I did tell him my mind freely.
We had some high words, but I was willing to end all in peace, and so I
made himâ€™ dine with me, and I have hopes to work my end upon him. After
dinner the barber trimmed me, and so to the office, where I do begin to
be exact in my duty there and exacting my privileges, and shall continue
to do so. None but Sir W. Batten and me here to-night, and so we broke
up early, and I home and to my chamber to put things in order, and so to
bed. My swelling I think do begin to go away again.
