22nd. Lay last night alone, my wife after her bathing lying alone in
another bed. So cold all night. Up and to the office, where busy all the
morning. At noon at the â€˜Change, busy; where great talk of a Dutch ship
in the North put on shore, and taken by a troop of horse. Home to
dinner and Creed with me. Thence to Gresham College, where very noble
discourse, and thence home busy till past 12 at night, and then home to
supper and to bed. Mrs. Bland come this night to take leave of me and my
wife, going to Tangier.
