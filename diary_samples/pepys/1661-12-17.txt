17th. Up and to the Paynter’s to see how he went forward in our picture.
So back again to dinner at home, and then was sent for to the Privy
Seal, whither I was forced to go and stay so long and late that I was
much vexed. At last we got all done, and then made haste to the office,
where they were sat, and there we sat late, and so home to supper and to
Selden, “Mare Clausum,” and so to bed.
