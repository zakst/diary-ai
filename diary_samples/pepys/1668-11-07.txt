7th. Up, and at the office all the morning, and so to it again after
dinner, and there busy late, choosing to employ myself rather than go
home to trouble with my wife, whom, however, I am forced to comply with,
and indeed I do pity her as having cause enough for her grief. So to
bed, and there slept ill because of my wife. This afternoon I did go out
towards Sir D. Gawdenâ€™s, thinking to have bespoke a place for my coach
and horses, when I have them, at the Victualling Office; but find the
way so bad and long that I returned, and looked up and down for places
elsewhere, in an inne, which I hope to get with more convenience than
there.
