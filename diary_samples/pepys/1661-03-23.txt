23d. All the morning at home putting papers in order, dined at home,
and then out to the Red Bull (where I had not been since plays come up
again), but coming too soon I went out again and walked all up and down
the Charterhouse yard and Aldersgate street. At last came back again
and went in, where I was led by a seaman that knew me, but is here as
a servant, up to the tireing-room, where strange the confusion and
disorder that there is among them in fitting themselves, especially
here, where the clothes are very poor, and the actors but common
fellows. At last into the Pitt, where I think there was not above ten
more than myself, and not one hundred in the whole house. And the play,
which is called “All’s lost by Lust,” poorly done; and with so much
disorder, among others, that in the musique-room the boy that was to
sing a song, not singing it right, his master fell about his ears and
beat him so, that it put the whole house in an uprore. Thence homewards,
and at the Mitre met my uncle Wight, and with him Lieut.-Col. Baron,
who told us how Crofton, the great Presbyterian minister that had lately
preached so highly against Bishops, is clapped up this day into the
Tower. Which do please some, and displease others exceedingly. Home and
to bed.
