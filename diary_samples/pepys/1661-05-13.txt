13th. All the morning at home among my workmen. At noon Mr. Creed and I
went to the ordinary behind the Exchange, where we lately were, but I do
not like it so well as I did. So home with him and to the office, where
we sat late, and he did deliver his accounts to us. The office being
done I went home and took pleasure to see my work draw to an end.
