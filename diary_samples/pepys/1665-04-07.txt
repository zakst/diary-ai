7th. Up betimes to the Duke of Albemarle about money to be got for the
Navy, or else we must shut up shop. Thence to Westminster Hall and up
and down, doing not much; then to London, but to prevent Povy’s dining
with me (who I see is at the ‘Change) I went back again and to Herbert’s
at Westminster, there sent for a bit of meat and dined, and then to
my Lord Treasurer’s, and there with Sir Philip Warwicke, and thence to
White Hall in my Lord Treasurer’s chamber with Sir Philip Warwicke
till dark night, about fower hours talking of the business of the
Navy Charge, and how Sir G. Carteret do order business, keeping us in
ignorance what he do with his money, and also Sir Philip did shew me
nakedly the King’s condition for money for the Navy; and he do assure
me, unless the King can get some noblemen or rich money-gentlemen to
lend him money, or to get the City to do it, it is impossible to find
money: we having already, as he says, spent one year’s share of the
three-years’ tax, which comes to L2,500,000. Being very glad of this
day’s discourse in all but that I fear I shall quite lose Sir G.
Carteret, who knows that I have been privately here all this day with
Sir Ph. Warwicke. However, I will order it so as to give him as little
offence as I can. So home to my office, and then to supper and to bed.
