7th. At the office all the morning, dined at home with my wife. After
dinner with her by coach to see Mr. Moore, who continues ill. I took his
books of accounts, and did discourse with him about my Lord’s and my
own businesses, and there being Mr. Battersby by, did take notice of my
having paid him the L100 borrowed of him, which they both did confess
and promise to return me my bond. Thence by water with Will. Howe to
Westminster, and there staying a little while in the Hall (my wife’s
father and mother being abroad, and so she returning presently) thence
by coach to my Lord’s, and there I left money for Captain Ferrers to buy
me two bands. So towards the New Exchange, and there while my wife was
buying things I walked up and down with Dr. Williams, talking about my
law businesses, and thence took him to my brother’s, and there gave him
a glass of wine, and so parted, and then by coach with my wife home, and
Sir J. M. and Sir W. B. being come from Chatham Pay I did go see them
for complaisance, and so home and to bed.
