27th. Up very betimes to finish my letter and writ it fair to Mr.
Gawden, it being to demand several arrears in the present state of the
victualling, partly to the King’s and partly to give him occasion to say
something relating to the want of money on his own behalf. This done I
to the office, where all the morning. At noon after a bit of dinner back
to the office and there fitting myself in all points to give an account
to the Duke and Mr. Coventry in all things, and in my Tangier business,
till three o’clock in the morning, and so to bed,
