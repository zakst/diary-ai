10th. Up and by water to White Hall, and there to a Committee of
Tangier, and had occasion to see how my Lord Ashworth--[Lord Ashworth
is probably a miswriting for Lord Ashley (afterwards Earl of
Shaftesbury).]--deports himself, which is very fine indeed, and it joys
my heart to see that there is any body looks so near into the King’s
business as I perceive he do in this business of my Lord Peterborough’s
accounts. Thence into the Parke, and met and walked with Captain Sylas
Taylor, my old acquaintance while I was of the Exchequer, and Dr. Whore,
talking of musique, and particularly of Mr. Berckenshaw’s way, which
Taylor magnifies mightily, and perhaps but what it deserves, but not
so easily to be understood as he and others make of it. Thence home
by water, and after dinner abroad to buy several things, as a map, and
powder, and other small things, and so home to my office, and in the
evening with Captain Taylor by water to our Tangier ship, and so home,
well pleased, having received L26 profit to-day of my bargain for this
ship, which comforts me mightily, though I confess my heart, what with
my being out of order as to my health, and the fear I have of the money
my Lord oweth me and I stand indebted to him in, is much cast down of
late. In the evening home to supper and to bed.
