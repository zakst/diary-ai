22nd. Up betimes and to my business of entering some Tangier payments
in my book in order, and then to the office, where very busy all the
morning. At noon home to dinner, Balty being gone back to sea and his
wife dining with us, whom afterward my wife carried home. I after
dinner to the office, and anon out on several occasions, among others
to Lovettâ€™s, and there staid by him and her and saw them (in their
poor conditioned manner) lay on their varnish, which however pleased me
mightily to see. Thence home to my business writing letters, and so at
night home to supper and to bed.
