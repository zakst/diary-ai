November 1st (Lord’s day). Up, and with W. Hewer at my chamber all this
morning, going further in my great business for the Duke of York, and so
at noon to dinner, and then W. Hewer to write fair what he had writ, and
my wife to read to me all the afternoon, till anon Mr. Gibson come, and
he and I to perfect it to my full mind, and so to supper and to bed, my
mind yet at disquiet that I cannot be informed how poor Deb. stands with
her mistress, but I fear she will put her away, and the truth is, though
it be much against my mind and to my trouble, yet I think that it will
be fit that she should be gone, for my wife’s peace and mine, for she
cannot but be offended at the sight of her, my wife having conceived
this jealousy of me with reason, and therefore for that, and other
reasons of expense, it will be best for me to let her go, but I shall
love and pity her. This noon Mr. Povy sent his coach for my wife and I
to see, which we like mightily, and will endeavour to have him get us
just such another.
