18th. Up, and to the Office, and at noon home, expecting to have this
day seen Bab. and Betty Pepys here, but they come not; and so after
dinner my wife and I to the Duke of York’s house, to a play, and there
saw “The Mad Lover,” which do not please me so well as it used to do,
only Betterton’s part still pleases me. But here who should we have come
to us but Bab. and Betty and Talbot, the first play they were yet at;
and going to see us, and hearing by my boy, whom I sent to them, that we
were here, they come to us hither, and happened all of us to sit by my
cozen Turner and The., and we carried them home first, and then took
Bab. and Betty to our house, where they lay and supped, and pretty
merry, and very fine with their new clothes, and good comely girls they
are enough, and very glad I am of their being with us, though I would
very well have been contented to have been without the charge. So they
to bed and we to bed.
