7th (Lord’s day). Up, and to church with my wife. Home and dined. After
dinner come Mr. Andrews and spent the afternoon with me, about our
Tangier business of the victuals, and then parted, and after sermon
comes Mr. Hill and a gentleman, a friend of his, one Mr. Scott, that
sings well also, and then comes Mr. Andrews, and we all sung and
supped, and then to sing again and passed the Sunday very pleasantly and
soberly, and so I to my office a little, and then home to prayers and to
bed. Yesterday begun my wife to learn to, limn of one Browne,

     [Alexander Browne, a printseller, who taught drawing, and practised
     it with success.  He published in 1669, “Ars Pictoria, or an Academy
     treating of Drawing, Painting, Limning and Etching.”]

which Mr. Hill helps her to, and, by her beginning upon some eyes, I
think she will [do] very fine things, and I shall take great delight in
it.
