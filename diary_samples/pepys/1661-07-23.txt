23rd. Put on my mourning. Made visits to Sir W. Pen and Batten. Then
to Westminster, and at the Hall staid talking with Mrs. Michell a good
while, and in the afternoon, finding myself unfit for business, I went
to the Theatre, and saw “Brenoralt,” I never saw before. It seemed a
good play, but ill acted; only I sat before Mrs. Palmer, the King’s
mistress, and filled my eyes with her, which much pleased me. Then to my
father’s, where by my desire I met my uncle Thomas, and discoursed of my
uncle’s will to him, and did satisfy [him] as well as I could. So to my
uncle Wight’s, but found him out of doors, but my aunt I saw and staid a
while, and so home and to bed. Troubled to hear how proud and idle Pall
is grown, that I am resolved not to keep her.
