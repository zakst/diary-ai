13th. Up betimes and to my office, and we sat all the morning, and then
at noon dined alone at home, and so among my work folks studying how to
get my way sure to me to go upon the leads, which I fear at last I must
be contented to go without, but, however, my mind is troubled still
about it. We met again in the afternoon to set accounts even between the
King and the masters of ships hired to carry provisions to Lisbon, and
in the evening Mr. Moore came to me and did lie with me at my lodgings.
It is great pleasure to me his company and discourse, and did talk also
about my law business, which I must now fall upon minding again, the
term coming on apace. So to bed.
