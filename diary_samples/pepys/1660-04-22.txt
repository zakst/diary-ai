22d (Easter Sunday). Several Londoners, strangers, friends of the
Captains, dined here, who, among other things told us, how the King’s
Arms are every day set up in houses and churches, particularly in
Allhallows Church in Thames-street, John Simpson’s church, which being
privately done was, a great eye-sore to his people when they came to
church and saw it. Also they told us for certain, that the King’s statue
is making by the Mercers’ Company (who are bound to do it) to set up in
the Exchange. After sermon in the afternoon I fell to writing letters
against to-morrow to send to London. After supper to bed.
