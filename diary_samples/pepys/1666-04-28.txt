28th. Up and to the office. At noon dined at home. After dinner abroad
with my wife to Hales’s to see only our pictures and Mrs. Pierce’s,
which I do not think so fine as I might have expected it. My wife to her
father’s, to carry him some ruling work, which I have advised her to let
him do. It will get him some money. She also is to look out again for
another little girle, the last we had being also gone home the very same
day she came. She was also to look after a necklace of pearle, which she
is mighty busy about, I being contented to lay out L80 in one for her.
I home to my business. By and by comes my wife and presently after, the
tide serving, Balty took leave of us, going to sea, and upon very good
terms, to be Muster-Master of a squadron, which will be worth L100 this
yeare to him, besides keeping him the benefit of his pay in the Guards.
He gone, I very busy all the afternoon till night, among other things,
writing a letter to my brother John, the first I have done since my
being angry with him, and that so sharpe a one too that I was sorry
almost to send it when I had wrote it, but it is preparatory to my
being kind to him, and sending for him up hither when he hath passed his
degree of Master of Arts. So home to supper and to bed.
