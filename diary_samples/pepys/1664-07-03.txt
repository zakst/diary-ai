The 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th they all did seriously declare, and lay
much stress upon them as rules fit to be observed indeed, and especially
the last, to lie with our heads where our heels do, or at least to make
the bed high at feet and low at head. Very merry all, as much as I
could be in such sorry company. Great discourse of the fray yesterday
in Moorefields, how the butchers at first did beat the weavers (between
whom there hath been ever an old competition for mastery), but at last
the weavers rallied and beat them. At first the butchers knocked down
all for weavers that had green or blue aprons, till they were fain to
pull them off and put them in their breeches. At last the butchers were
fain to pull off their sleeves, that they might not be known, and were
soundly beaten out of the field, and some deeply wounded and bruised;
till at last the weavers went out tryumphing, calling L100 for a
butcher. I to Mr. Reeves to see a microscope, he having been with me
to-day morning, and there chose one which I will have. Thence back and
took up young Mrs. Harman, a pretty bred and pretty humoured woman whom
I could love well, though not handsome, yet for her person and carriage,
and black. By the way met her husband going for her, and set them both
down at home, and so home to my office a while, and so to supper and
bed.
