16th. Up and to the office, where all the morning upon the dispute of
Mr. Wood’s masts, and at noon with Mr. Coventry to the African House;
and after a good and pleasant dinner, up with him, Sir W. Rider, the
simple Povy, of all the most ridiculous foole that ever I knew to
attend to business, and Creed and Vernatty, about my Lord Peterborough’s
accounts; but the more we look into them, the more we see of them that
makes dispute, which made us break off, and so I home, and there found
my wife and Besse gone over the water to Half-way house, and after them,
thinking to have gone to Woolwich, but it was too late, so eat a cake
and home, and thence by coach to have spoke with Tom Trice about a
letter I met with this afternoon from my cozen Scott, wherein he seems
to deny proceeding as my father’s attorney in administering for him
in my brother Tom’s estate, but I find him gone out of town, and so
returned vexed home and to the office, where late writing a letter to
him, and so home and to bed.
