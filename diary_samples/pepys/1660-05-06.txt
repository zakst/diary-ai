6th (Lord’s day). This morning while we were at sermon comes in Dr.
Clarges and a dozen gentlemen to see my Lord, who, after sermon,
dined with him; I remember that last night upon discourse
concerning Clarges my Lord told me that he was a man of small
entendimiento.--[Entendimiento, Spanish: the understanding.]--This
afternoon there was a gentleman with me, an officer of Dunkirk going
over, who came to me for an order and told me he was lately with my
uncle and Aunt Fenner and that Kate’s fits of the convulsions did hold
her still. It fell very well to-day, a stranger preached here for Mr.
Ibbot, one Mr. Stanley, who prayed for King Charles, by the Grace of
God, &c., which gave great contentment to the gentlemen that were on
board here, and they said they would talk of it, when they come to
Breda, as not having it done yet in London so publickly. After they were
gone from on board, my Lord writ a letter to the King and give it to
me to carry privately to Sir William Compton’ on board the Assistance,
which I did, and after a health to his Majesty on board there, I left
them under sail for Breda. Back again and found them at sermon. I went
up to my cabin and looked over my accounts, and find that, all my debts
paid and my preparations to sea paid for, I have L640 clear in my purse.
After supper to bed.
