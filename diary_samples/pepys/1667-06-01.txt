June 1st. Up; and there comes to me Mr. Commander, whom I employ about
hiring of some ground behind the office, for the building of me a stable
and coach-house: for I do find it necessary for me, both in respect to
honour and the profit of it also, my expense in hackney-coaches being
now so great, to keep a coach, and therefore will do it. Having given
him some instructions about it, I to the office, where we sat all the
morning; where we have news that our peace with Spayne, as to trade, is
wholly concluded, and we are to furnish him with some men for Flanders
against the French. How that will agree with the French, I know not; but
they say that he also hath liberty, to get what men he pleases out
of England. But for the Spaniard, I hear that my Lord Castlehaven
is raising a regiment of 4000 men, which he is to command there; and
several young gentlemen are going over in commands with him: and they
say the Duke of Monmouth is going over only as a traveller, not to
engage on either side, but only to see the campagne, which will be
becoming him much more than to live whoreing and rogueing, as he now
do. After dinner to the office, where, after a little nap, I fell to
business, and did very much with infinite joy to myself, as it always is
to me when I have dispatched much business, and therefore it troubles me
to see how hard it is for me to settle to it sometimes when my mind is
upon pleasure. So home late to supper and to bed.
