31st. Up, and after some time with Greeting upon my flageolet I to
my office, and there all the morning busy. Among other things, Sir W.
Batten, [Sir] W. Pen, and myself did examine a fellow of our private
man-of-war, who we have found come up from Hull, with near L500 worth of
pieces of eight, though he will confess but 100 pieces. But it appears
that there have been fine doings there. At noon dined at home, and then
to the office, where busy again till the evening, when Major Halsey and
Kinaston to adjust matters about Mrs. Rumbald’s bill of exchange, and
here Major Halsey, speaking much of my doing business, and understanding
business, told me how my Lord Generall do say that I am worth them
all, but I have heard that Halsey hath said the same behind my back to
others. Then abroad with my wife by coach to Marrowbone, where my Lord
Mayor and Aldermen, it seem, dined to-day: and were just now going away,
methought, in a disconsolate condition, compared with their splendour
they formerly had, when the City was standing. Here my wife and I drank
at the gate, not ‘lighting, and then home with much pleasure, and so to
my chamber, and my wife and I to pipe, and so to supper and to bed.
