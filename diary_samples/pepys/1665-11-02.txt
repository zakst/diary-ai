2nd. Up, left my wife and to the office, and there to my great content
Sir W. Warren come to me to settle the business of the Tangier boates,
wherein I shall get above L100, besides L100 which he gives me in the
paying for them out of his owne purse. He gone, I home to my lodgings
to dinner, and there comes Captain Wagers newly returned from the
Streights, who puts me in great fear for our last ships that went to
Tangier with provisions, that they will be taken. A brave, stout fellow
this Captain is, and I think very honest. To the office again after
dinner and there late writing letters, and then about 8 at night set out
from my office and fitting myself at my lodgings intended to have gone
this night in a Ketch down to the Fleete, but calling in my way at Sir
J. Minnesâ€™s, who is come up from Erith about something about the prizes,
they persuaded me not to go till the morning, it being a horrible darke
and a windy night. So I back to my lodging and to bed.
