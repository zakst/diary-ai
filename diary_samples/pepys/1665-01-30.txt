30th. This is solemnly kept as a Fast all over the City, but I kept my
house, putting my closett to rights again, having lately put it out of
order in removing my books and things in order to being made clean. At
this all day, and at night to my office, there to do some business, and
being late at it, comes Mercer to me, to tell me that my wife was in
bed, and desired me to come home; for they hear, and have, night after
night, lately heard noises over their head upon the leads. Now it is
strange to think how, knowing that I have a great sum of money in my
house, this puts me into a most mighty affright, that for more than two
hours, I could not almost tell what to do or say, but feared this and
that, and remembered that this evening I saw a woman and two men stand
suspiciously in the entry, in the darke; I calling to them, they made me
only this answer, the woman said that the men came to see her; but who
she was I could not tell. The truth is, my house is mighty dangerous,
having so many ways to be come to; and at my windows, over the stairs,
to see who goes up and down; but, if I escape to-night, I will remedy
it. God preserve us this night safe! So at almost two oâ€™clock, I home to
my house, and, in great fear, to bed, thinking every running of a mouse
really a thiefe; and so to sleep, very brokenly, all night long, and
found all safe in the morning.
