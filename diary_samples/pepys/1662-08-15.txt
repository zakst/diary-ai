15th. Up very early, and up about seeing how my work proceeds, and am
pretty well pleased therewith; especially my wife’s closet will be very
pretty. So to the office and there very busy, and many people coming
to me. At noon to the Change, and there hear of some Quakers that are
seized on, that would have blown up the prison in Southwark where they
are put. So to the Swan, in Old Fish Street, where Mr. Brigden and his
father-in-law, Blackbury, of whom we had bought timber in the office,
but have not dealt well with us, did make me a fine dinner only to
myself; and after dinner comes in a jugler, which shewed us very pretty
tricks. I seemed very pleasant, but am no friend to the man’s dealings
with us in the office. After an hour or two sitting after dinner talking
about office business, where I had not spent any time a great while,
I went to Paul’s Church Yard to my bookseller’s; and there I hear that
next Sunday will be the last of a great many Presbyterian ministers in
town, who, I hear, will give up all. I pray God the issue may be good,
for the discontent is great. Home and to my office till 9 at night doing
business, and so to bed. My mind well pleased with a letter I found at
home from Mr. Coventry, expressing his satisfaction in a letter I writ
last night, and sent him this morning, to be corrected by him in order
to its sending down to all the Yards as a charge to them.
