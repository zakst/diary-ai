22nd. This morning, from some difference between my wife and Sarah, her
maid, my wife and I fell out cruelly, to my great discontent. But I do
see her set so against the wench, whom I take to be a most extraordinary
good servant, that I was forced for the wench’s sake to bid her get her
another place, which shall cost some trouble to my wife, however, before
I suffer to be. Thence to the office, where I sat all the morning, then
dined; Mr. Moore with me, at home, my wife busy putting her furniture in
order. Then he and I out, and he home and I to my cozen Roger Pepys to
advise about treating with my uncle Thomas, and thence called at the
Wardrobe on Mr. Moore again, and so home, and after doing much business
at my office I went home and caused a new fashion knocker to be put
on my door, and did other things to the putting my house in order, and
getting my outward door painted, and the arch. This day I bought the
book of country dances against my wife’s woman Gosnell comes, who dances
finely; and there meeting Mr. Playford he did give me his Latin songs of
Mr. Deering’s, which he lately printed. This day Mr. Moore told me that
for certain the Queen-Mother is married to my Lord St. Albans, and he is
like to be made Lord Treasurer. Newes that Sir J. Lawson hath made up a
peace now with Tunis and Tripoli, as well as Argiers, by which he will
come home very highly honoured.
