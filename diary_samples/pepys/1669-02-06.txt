6th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and thence after
dinner to the King’s playhouse, and there,--in an upper box, where
come in Colonel Poynton and Doll Stacey, who is very fine, and, by her
wedding-ring, I suppose he hath married her at last,--did see “The
Moor of Venice:” but ill acted in most parts; Mohun, which did a little
surprise me, not acting Iago’s part by much so well as Clun used to
do; nor another Hart’s, which was Cassio’s; nor, indeed, Burt doing
the Moor’s so well as I once thought he did. Thence home, and just at
Holborn Conduit the bolt broke, that holds the fore-wheels to the perch,
and so the horses went away with them, and left the coachman and us;
but being near our coachmaker’s, and we staying in a little ironmonger’s
shop, we were presently supplied with another, and so home, and there to
my letters at the office, and so to supper and to bed.
