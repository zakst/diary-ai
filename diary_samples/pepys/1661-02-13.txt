13th. At the office all the morning; dined at home, and poor Mr. Wood
with me, who after dinner would have borrowed money of me, but I would
lend none. Then to Whitehall by coach with Sir W. Pen, where we did very
little business, and so back to Mr. Rawlinson’s, where I took him and
gave him a cup of wine, he having formerly known Mr. Rawlinson, and
here I met my uncle Wight, and he drank with us, and with him to Sir W.
Batten’s, whither I sent for my wife, and we chose Valentines’ against
to-morrow.

     [The observation of St. Valentine’s day is very ancient in this
     country.  Shakespeare makes Ophelia sing

                   “To-morrow is Saint Valentine’s day,
                    All in the morning betime,
                    And I a maid at your window
                    To be your Valentine.”

                         Hamlet, act iv.  sc. 5.--M. B.]

My wife chose me, which did much please me; my Lady Batten Sir W. Pen,
&c. Here we sat late, and so home to bed, having got my Lady Batten to
give me a spoonful of honey for my cold.
