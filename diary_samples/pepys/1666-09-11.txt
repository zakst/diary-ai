11th. Lay there, and up betimes, and by water with my gold, and laid it
with the rest in my office, where I find all well and safe. So with Sir
W. Batten to the New Exchange by water and to my Lord Bruncker’s house,
where Sir W. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret met. Little business before us
but want of money. Broke up, and I home by coach round the town. Dined
at home, Balty and myself putting up my papers in m closet in the
office. He away, I down to Deptford and there spoke with Bagwell and
agreed upon to-morrow, and come home in the rain by water. In the
evening at Sir W. Pen’s; with my wife, at supper, he in a mad,
ridiculous, drunken humour; and it seems there have been some late
distances between his lady and him, as my [wife] tells me. After supper,
I home, and with Mr. Hater, Gibson, and Tom alone, got all my chests and
money into the further cellar with much pains, but great content to me
when done. So very late and weary, to bed.
