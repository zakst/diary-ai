25th (Lord’s day). At church in the morning, and dined at home alone
with my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had
a very good and pungent sermon of Mr. Mills, discoursing the necessity
of restitution. Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to
look something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to
them, and is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not
troubled at at all. By and by comes in my father (he intends to go
into the country to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last
called Pall up to us, and there in great anger told her before my father
that I would keep her no longer, and my father he said he would have
nothing to do with her. At last, after we had brought down her high
spirit, I got my father to yield that she should go into the country
with my mother and him, and stay there awhile to see how she will demean
herself. That being done, my father and I to my uncle Wight’s, and there
supped, and he took his leave of them, and so I walked with [him] as far
as Paul’s and there parted, and I home, my mind at some rest upon this
making an end with Pall, who do trouble me exceedingly.
