10th (Lordâ€™s day). Took physique all day, and, God forgive me, did spend
it in reading of some little French romances. At night my wife and I
did please ourselves talking of our going into France, which I hope to
effect this summer. At noon one came to ask for Mrs. Hunt that was here
yesterday, and it seems is not come home yet, which makes us afraid of
her. At night to bed.
