2nd. Up betimes and got myself ready alone, and so to my office, my mind
much troubled for my key that I lost yesterday, and so to my workmen and
put them in order, and so to my office, and we met all the morning, and
then dined at Sir W. Battenâ€™s with Sir W. Pen, and so to my office again
all the afternoon, and in the evening wrote a letter to Mr. Cooke, in
the country, in behalf of my brother Tom, to his mistress, it being the
first of my appearing in it, and if she be as Tom sets her out, it may
be very well for him. So home and eat a bit, and so to my lodging to
bed.
