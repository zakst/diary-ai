7th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home to
dinner, where Goodgroome was teaching my wife, and dined with us, and
I did tell him of my intention to learn to trill, which he will not
promise I shall obtain, but he will do what can be done, and I am
resolved to learn. All the afternoon at the office, and towards night
out by coach with my wife, she to the ‘Change, and I to see the price of
a copper cisterne for the table, which is very pretty, and they demand
L6 or L7 for one; but I will have one. Then called my wife at the
‘Change, and bought a nightgown for my wife: cost but 24s., and so out
to Mile End to drink, and so home to the office to end my letters, and
so home to supper and to bed.
