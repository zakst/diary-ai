Sept. 1st. Up pretty betimes, and after a little at my viall to my
office, where we sat all the morning, and I got my bill among others for
my carved work (which I expected to have paid for myself) signed at the
table, and hope to get the money back again, though if the rest had not
got it paid by the King, I never intended nor did desire to have him pay
for my vanity. In the evening my brother John coming to me to complain
that my wife seems to be discontented at his being here, and shows
him great disrespect; so I took and walked with him in the garden, and
discoursed long with him about my affairs, and how imprudent it is for
my father and mother and him to take exceptions without great cause at
my wife, considering how much it concerns them to keep her their friend
and for my peace; not that I would ever be led by her to forget or
desert them in the main, but yet she deserves to be pleased and complied
with a little, considering the manner of life that I keep her to, and
how convenient it were for me to have Brampton for her to be sent to
when I have a mind or occasion to go abroad to Portsmouth or elsewhere.
So directed him how to behave himself to her, and gave him other
counsel; and so to my office, where late.
