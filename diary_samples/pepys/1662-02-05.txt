5th. Early at the office. Sir G. Carteret, the two Sir Williams and
myself all alone reading of the Duke’s institutions for the settlement
of our office, whereof we read as much as concerns our own duties, and
left the other officers for another time. I did move several things for
my purpose, and did ease my mind. At noon Sir W. Pen dined with me, and
after dinner he and I and my wife to the Theatre, and went in, but being
very early we went out again to the next door, and drank some Rhenish
wine and sugar, and so to the House again, and there saw “Rule a Wife
and have a Wife” very well done. And here also I did look long upon my
Lady Castlemaine, who, notwithstanding her late sickness, continues a
great beauty. Home and supped with Sir W. Pen and played at cards with
him, and so home and to bed, putting some cataplasm to my.... which
begins to swell again.
