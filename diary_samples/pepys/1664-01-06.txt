6th (Twelfth day). Up and to my office, where very busy all the morning,
being indeed over loaded with it through my own desire of doing all I
can. At noon to the ‘Change, but did little, and so home to dinner with
my poor wife, and after dinner read a lecture to her in Geography, which
she takes very prettily and with great pleasure to her and me to teach
her, and so to the office again, where as busy as ever in my life,
one thing after another, and answering people’s business, particularly
drawing up things about Mr. Wood’s masts, which I expect to have a
quarrel about with Sir W. Batten before it be ended, but I care not. At
night home to my wife, to supper, discourse, prayers, and to bed. This
morning I began a practice which I find by the ease I do it with that I
shall continue, it saving me money and time; that is, to trimme myself
with a razer: which pleases me mightily.
