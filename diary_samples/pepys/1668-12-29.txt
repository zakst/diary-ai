29th. Up, and at the Office all the morning, and at noon to dinner, and
there, by a pleasant mistake, find my uncle and aunt Wight, and three
more of their company, come to dine with me to-day, thinking that they
had been invited, which they were not; but yet we did give them a pretty
good dinner, and mighty merry at the mistake. They sat most of the
afternoon with us, and then parted, and my wife and I out, thinking to
have gone to a play, but it was too far begun, and so to the â€˜Change,
and there she and I bought several things, and so home, with much
pleasure talking, and then to reading, and so to supper and to bed.
