October 1st. Up with my mind pretty well at rest about my accounts and
other business, and so to my house and there put my work to business,
and then down to Deptford to do the same there, and so back and with my
workmen all the afternoon, and my wife putting a chamber in order for us
to lie in. At night to look over some Brampton papers against the Court
which I expect every day to hear of, and that done home and with my
wife to bed, the first time I have lain there these two months and more,
which I am now glad to do again, and do so like the chamber as it is now
ordered that all my fear is my not keeping it. But I hope the best, for
it would vex me to the heart to lose it.
