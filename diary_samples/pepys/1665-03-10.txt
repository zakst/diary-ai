10th. Up, and to the office all the morning. At noon to the ‘Change,
where very hot, people’s proposal of the City giving the King’ another
ship for “The London,” that is lately blown up, which would be very
handsome, and if well managed, might be done; but I fear if it be put
into ill hands, or that the courtiers do solicit it, it will never be
done. Home to dinner, and thence to the Committee of Tangier at White
Hall, where my Lord Barkely and Craven and others; but, Lord! to see how
superficially things are done in the business of the Lottery, which will
be the disgrace of the Fishery, and without profit. Home, vexed at
my loss of time, and thereto my office. Late at night come the two
Bellamys, formerly petty warrant Victuallers of the Navy, to take my
advice about a navy debt of theirs for the compassing of which they
offer a great deal of money, and the thing most just. Perhaps I may
undertake it, and get something by it, which will be a good job. So home
late to bed.
