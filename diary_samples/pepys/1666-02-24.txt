24th. All the morning at the office till past three o’clock. At that
houre home and eat a bit alone, my wife being gone out. So abroad by
coach with Mr. Hill, who staid for me to speake about business, and he
and I to Hales’s, where I find my wife and her woman, and Pierce and
Knipp, and there sung and was mighty merry, and I joyed myself in it;
but vexed at first to find my wife’s picture not so like as I expected;
but it was only his having finished one part, and not another, of
the face; but, before I went, I was satisfied it will be an excellent
picture. Here we had ale and cakes and mighty merry, and sung my song,
which she [Knipp] now sings bravely, and makes me proud of myself.
Thence left my wife to go home with Mrs. Pierce, while I home to the
office, and there pretty late, and to bed, after fitting myself for
to-morrow’s journey.
