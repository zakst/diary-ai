12th (Lord’s day). To church, where a stranger made a very good sermon.
At noon Sir W. Pen and my good friend Dean Fuller, by appointment, and
my wife’s brother by chance, dined with me very merry and handsomely.
After dinner the Dean, my wife and I by Sir W. Pen’s coach left us, he
to Whitehall, and my wife and I to visit Mrs. Pierce and thence Mrs.
Turner, who continues very ill still, and The. is also fallen sick,
which do trouble me for the poor mother. So home and to read, I being
troubled to hear my wife rate though not without cause at her mayd Nell,
who is a lazy slut. So to prayers and to bed.
