14th (Lord’s day). After long lying discoursing with my wife, I up,
and comes Mr. Holliard to see me, who concurs with me that my pain is
nothing but cold in my legs breeding wind, and got only by my using to
wear a gowne, and that I am not at all troubled with any ulcer, but my
thickness of water comes from my overheat in my back. He gone, comes Mr.
Herbert, Mr. Honiwood’s man, and dined with me, a very honest, plain,
well-meaning man, I think him to be; and by his discourse and manner of
life, the true embleme of an old ordinary serving-man. After dinner up
to my chamber and made an end of Dr. Power’s booke of the Microscope,
very fine and to my content, and then my wife and I with great pleasure,
but with great difficulty before we could come to find the manner of
seeing any thing by my microscope. At last did with good content, though
not so much as I expect when I come to understand it better. By and by
comes W. Joyce, in his silke suit, and cloake lined with velvett:
staid talking with me, and I very merry at it. He supped with me; but a
cunning, crafty fellow he is, and dangerous to displease, for his tongue
spares nobody. After supper I up to read a little, and then to bed.
