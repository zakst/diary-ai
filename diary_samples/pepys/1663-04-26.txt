26th (Lord’s-day). Lay pretty long in bed talking with my wife, and then
up and set to the making up of my monthly accounts, but Tom coming, with
whom I was angry for botching my camlott coat, to tell me that my father
and he would dine with me, and that my father was at our church, I got
me ready and had a very good sermon of a country minister upon “How
blessed a thing it is for brethren to live together in unity!” So home
and all to dinner, and then would have gone by coach to have seen my
Lord Sandwich at Chelsey if the man would have taken us, but he denying
it we staid at home, and I all the afternoon upon my accounts, and find
myself worth full L700, for which I bless God, it being the most I was
ever yet worth in money. In the evening (my father being gone to my
brother’s to lie to-night) my wife, Ashwell, and the boy and I, and the
dogg, over the water and walked to Half-way house, and beyond into the
fields, gathering of cowslipps, and so to Half-way house, with some cold
lamb we carried with us, and there supped, and had a most pleasant walk
back again, Ashwell all along telling us some parts of their mask
at Chelsey School, which was very pretty, and I find she hath a most
prodigious memory, remembering so much of things acted six or seven
years ago. So home, and after reading my vows, being sleepy, without
prayers to bed, for which God forgive me!
