29th. To Westminster, and at the Parliament door spoke with Mr. Coventry
about business, and so to the Wardrobe to dinner, and thence to several
places, and so home, where I found Mrs. Pen and Mrs. Rooth and Smith,
who played at cards with my wife, and I did give them a barrel of
oysters, and had a pullet to supper for them, and when it was ready to
come to table, the foolish girl had not the manners to stay and sup with
me, but went away, which did vex me cruelly. So I saw her home, and then
to supper, and so to musique practice, and to bed.
