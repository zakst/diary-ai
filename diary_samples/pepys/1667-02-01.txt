February 1st. Up, and to the office, where I was all the morning doing
business, at noon home to dinner, and after dinner down by water,
though it was a thick misty and rainy day, and walked to Deptford from
Redriffe, and there to Bagwell’s by appointment, where the ‘mulier etoit
within expecting me venir.... By and by ‘su marido’ come in, and there
without any notice taken by him we discoursed of our business of getting
him the new ship building by Mr. Deane, which I shall do for him. Thence
by and by after a little talk I to the yard, and spoke with some of
the officers, but staid but little, and the new clerk of the ‘Chequer,
Fownes, did walk to Redriffe back with me. I perceive he is a very
child, and is led by the nose by Cowly and his kinsman that was
his clerk, but I did make him understand his duty, and put both
understanding and spirit into him, so that I hope he will do well.
[Much surprised to hear this day at Deptford that Mrs. Batters is going
already to be married to him, that is now the Captain of her husband’s
ship. She seemed the most passionate mourner in the world. But I believe
it cannot be true.]--(The passage between brackets is written in the
margin of the MS.)--Thence by water to Billingsgate; thence to the Old
Swan, and there took boat, it being now night, to Westminster Hall,
there to the Hall, and find Doll Lane, and ‘con elle’ I went to the Bell
Taverne, and ‘ibi je’ did do what I would ‘con elle’ as well as I could,
she ‘sedendo sobre’ thus far and making some little resistance. But
all with much content, and ‘je tenai’ much pleasure ‘cum ista’. There
parted, and I by coach home, and to the office, where pretty late doing
business, and then home, and merry with my wife, and to supper. My
brother and I did play with the base, and I upon my viallin, which I
have not seen out of the case now I think these three years, or more,
having lost the key, and now forced to find an expedient to open it.
Then to bed.
