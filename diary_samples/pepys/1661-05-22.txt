22nd. To Westminster, and there missed of my Lord, and so about noon I
and W. Howe by water to the Wardrobe, where my Lord and all the officers
of the Wardrobe dined, and several other friends of my Lord, at a
venison pasty. Before dinner, my Lady Wright and my Lady Jem. sang songs
to the harpsicon. Very pleasant and merry at dinner. And then I went
away by water to the office, and there staid till it was late. At night
before I went to bed the barber came to trim me and wash me, and so to
bed, in order to my being clean to-morrow.
