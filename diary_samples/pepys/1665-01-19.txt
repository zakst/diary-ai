19th. Up, and it being yesterday and to-day a great thaw it is not for
a man to walk the streets, but took coach and to Mr. Povy’s, and there
meeting all of us again agreed upon an answer to the Lords by and by,
and thence we did come to Exeter House, and there was a witness of most
[base] language against Mr. Povy, from my Lord Peterborough, who is most
furiously angry with him, because the other, as a foole, would needs
say that the L26,000 was my Lord Peterborough’s account, and that he had
nothing to do with it. The Lords did find fault also with our answer,
but I think really my Lord Ashly would fain have the outside of
an Exchequer,--[This word is blotted, and the whole sentence is
confused.]--but when we come better to be examined. So home by coach,
with my Lord Barkeley, who, by his discourse, I find do look upon Mr.
Coventry as an enemy but yet professes great justice and pains. I at
home after dinner to the office, and there sat all the afternoon and
evening, and then home to supper and to bed. Memorandum. This day and
yesterday, I think it is the change of the weather, I have a great deal
of pain, but nothing like what I use to have. I can hardly keep myself
loose, but on the contrary am forced to drive away my pain. Here I am so
sleepy I cannot hold open my eyes, and therefore must be forced to break
off this day’s passages more shortly than I would and should have
done. This day was buried (but I could not be there) my cozen Percivall
Angier; and yesterday I received the newes that Dr. Tom Pepys is dead,
at Impington, for which I am but little sorry, not only because he would
have been troublesome to us, but a shame to his family and profession;
he was such a coxcomb.
