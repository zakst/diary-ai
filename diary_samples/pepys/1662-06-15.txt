15th (Lord’s day). To church in the morning and home to dinner, where
come my brother Tom and Mr. Fisher, my cozen, Nan Pepys’s second
husband, who, I perceive, is a very good-humoured man, an old cavalier.
I made as much of him as I could, and were merry, and am glad she hath
light of so good a man. They gone, to church again; but my wife not
being dressed as I would have her, I was angry, and she, when she was
out of doors in her way to church, returned home again vexed. But I to
church, Mr. Mills, an ordinary sermon. So home, and found my wife and
Sarah gone to a neighbour church, at which I was not much displeased. By
and by she comes again, and, after a word or two, good friends. And
then her brother came to see her, and he being gone she told me that
she believed he was married and had a wife worth L500 to him, and did
inquire how he might dispose the money to the best advantage, but I
forbore to advise her till she could certainly tell me how things are
with him, being loth to meddle too soon with him. So to walk upon the
leads, and to supper, and to bed.
