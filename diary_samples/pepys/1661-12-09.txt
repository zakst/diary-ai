9th. To Whitehall, and thence to the Rhenish wine-house, where I met
Mons. Eschar and there took leave of him, he being to go this night to
the Downs towards Portugall, and so spent all the morning. At noon to
dinner to the Wardrobe; where my Lady Wright was, who did talk much upon
the worth and the desert of gallantry; and that there was none fit to
be courtiers, but such as have been abroad and know fashions. Which I
endeavoured to oppose; and was troubled to hear her talk so, though she
be a very wise and discreet lady in other things. From thence Mr. Moore
and I to the Temple about my law business with my cozen Turner, and
there we read over T. Triceâ€™s answer to my bill and advised thereupon
what to do in his absence, he being to go out of town to-morrow. Thence
he and I to Mr. Walpole, my attorney, whom I never saw before, and we
all to an alehouse hard by, and there we talked of our business, and
he put me into great hopes, but he is but a young man, and so I do not
depend so much upon his encouragement. So by coach home, and to supper,
and to bed, having staid up till 12 at night writing letters to my Lord
Sandwich and all my friends with him at sea, to send to-morrow by Mons.
Eschar, who goes tomorrow post to the Downs to go along with the fleet
to Portugall.
