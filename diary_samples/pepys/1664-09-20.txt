20th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, at noon to the
‘Change, and there met by appointment with Captain Poyntz, who hath some
place, or title to a place, belonging to gameing, and so I discoursed
with him about the business of our improving of the Lotterys, to the
King’s benefit, and that of the Fishery, and had some light from him in
the business, and shall, he says, have more in writing from him. So home
to dinner and then abroad to the Fishing Committee at Fishmongers’ Hall,
and there sat and did some business considerable, and so up and home,
and there late at my office doing much business, and I find with great
delight that I am come to my good temper of business again. God continue
me in it. So home to supper, it being washing day, and to bed.
