20th. Up and by water with Commissioner Pett to Deptford, and there
looked over the yard, and had a call, wherein I am very highly pleased
with our new manner of call-books, being my invention. Thence thinking
to have gone down to Woolwich in the Charles pleasure boat, but she
run aground, it being almost low water, and so by oars to the town, and
there dined, and then to the yard at Mr. Ackworth’s, discoursing with
the officers of the yard about their stores of masts, which was our
chief business, and having done something therein, took boat and to the
pleasure boat, which was come down to fetch us back, and I could have
been sick if I would in going, the wind being very fresh, but very
pleasant it was, and the first time I have sailed in any one of them. It
carried us to Cuckold’s Point, and so by oars to the Temple, it raining
hard, where missed speaking with my cosen Roger, and so walked home and
to my office; there spent the night till bed time, and so home to supper
and to bed.
