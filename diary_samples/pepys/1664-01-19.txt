19th. Up, without any kindness to my wife, and so to the office, where
we sat all the morning, and at noon I to the ‘Change, and thence to Mr.
Cutler’s with Sir W. Rider to dinner, and after dinner with him to the
Old James upon our reference of Mr. Bland’s, and, having sat there upon
the business half an hour, broke up, and I home and there found Madame
Turner and her sister Dike come to see us, and staid chatting till
night, and so away, and I to my office till very late, and my eyes began
to fail me, and be in pain which I never felt to now-a-days, which I
impute to sitting up late writing and reading by candle-light. So home
to supper and to bed.
