6th. Up early, my mind full of business, then to the office, where
the two Sir Williams and I spent the morning passing the victualler’s
accounts, the first I have had to do withal. Then home, where my Uncle
Thomas (by promise and his son Tom) were come to give me his answer
whether he would have me go to law or arbitracon with him, but he is
unprovided to answer me, and desires two days more. I left them to dine
with my wife, and myself to Mr. Gauden and the two knights at dinner
at the Dolphin, and thence after dinner to the office back again till
night, we having been these four or five days very full of business, and
I thank God I am well pleased with it, and hope I shall continue of that
temper, which God grant. So after a little being at Sir W. Batten’s with
Sir G. Carteret talking, I went home, and so to my chamber, and then to
bed, my mind somewhat troubled about Brampton affairs. This night my
new camelott riding coat to my coloured cloth suit came home. More news
to-day of our losses at Brampton by the late storm.
