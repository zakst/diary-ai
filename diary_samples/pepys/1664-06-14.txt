14th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and had great
conflict about the flags again, and am vexed methought to see my Lord
Berkely not satisfied with what I said, but however I stop the King’s
being abused by the flag makers for the present. I do not know how it
may end, but I will do my best to preserve it. So home to dinner, and
after dinner by coach to Kensington. In the way overtaking Mr. Laxton,
the apothecary, with his wife and daughters, very fine young lasses,
in a coach; and so both of us to my Lady Sandwich, who hath lain this
fortnight here at Deane Hodges’s. Much company came hither to-day, my
Lady Carteret, &c., Sir William Wheeler and his lady, and, above all,
Mr. Becke, of Chelsy, and wife and daughter, my Lord’s mistress, and one
that hath not one good feature in her face, and yet is a fine lady, of
a fine taille, and very well carriaged, and mighty discreet. I took all
the occasion I could to discourse with the young ladies in her company
to give occasion to her to talk, which now and then she did, and that
mighty finely, and is, I perceive, a woman of such an ayre, as I wonder
the less at my Lord’s favour to her, and I dare warrant him she hath
brains enough to entangle him. Two or three houres we were in her
company, going into Sir H. Finche’s garden, and seeing the fountayne,
and singing there with the ladies, and a mighty fine cool place it is,
with a great laver of water in the middle and the bravest place for
musique I ever heard. After much mirthe, discoursing to the ladies
in defence of the city against the country or court, and giving them
occasion to invite themselves to-morrow to me to dinner, to my venison
pasty, I got their mother’s leave, and so good night, very well
pleased with my day’s work, and, above all, that I have seen my Lord’s
mistresse. So home to supper, and a little at my office, and to bed.
