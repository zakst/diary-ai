27th. Up, and he and I walked to Paul’s Church yard, and there saw Sir
Harry Spillman’s book, and I bespoke it and others, and thence we took
coach, and he to my Lord’s and I to St. James’s, where we did our usual
business, and thence I home and dined, and then by water to Woolwich,
and there spent the afternoon till night under pretence of buying
Captain Blackman’s house and grounds, and viewing the ground took notice
of Clothiers’ cordage with which he, I believe, thinks to cheat the
King. That being done I by water home, it being night first, and there I
find our new mayd Jane come, a cook mayd. So to bed.
