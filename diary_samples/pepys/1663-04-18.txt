18th. Up betimes and to my office, where all the morning. At noon to
dinner. With us Mr. Creed, who has been deeply engaged at the office
this day about the ending of his accounts, wherein he is most unhappy
to have to do with a company of fools who after they have signed his
accounts and made bills upon them yet dare not boldly assert to the
Treasurer that they are satisfied with his accounts. Hereupon all
dinner, and walking in the garden the afternoon, he and I talking of the
ill management of our office, which God knows is very ill for the Kingâ€™s
advantage. I would I could make it better. In the evening to my office,
and at night home to supper and bed.
