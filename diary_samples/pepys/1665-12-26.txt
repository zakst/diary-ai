26th. Up, and to the office, where Sir J. Minnes and my Lord Bruncker
and I met, to give our directions to the Commanders of all the ships
in the river to bring in lists of their ships’ companies, with entries,
discharges, &c., all the last voyage, where young Seymour, among 20 that
stood bare, stood with his hat on, a proud, saucy young man. Thence with
them to Mr. Cuttle’s, being invited, and dined nobly and neatly; with a
very pretty house and a fine turret at top, with winding stairs and the
finest prospect I know about all Greenwich, save the top of the hill,
and yet in some respects better than that. Here I also saw some fine
writing worke and flourishing of Mr. Hore, he one that I knew long
ago, an acquaintance of Mr. Tomson’s at Westminster, that is this
man’s clerk. It is the story of the several Archbishops of Canterbury,
engrossed in vellum, to hang up in Canterbury Cathedrall in tables, in
lieu of the old ones, which are almost worn out. Thence to the office a
while, and so to Captain Cocke’s and there talked, and home to look over
my papers, and so to bed.
