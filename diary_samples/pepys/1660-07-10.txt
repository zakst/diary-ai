10th. This day I put on first my new silk suit, the first that ever I
wore in my life. This morning came Nan Pepys’ husband Mr. Hall to see
me being lately come to town. I had never seen him before. I took him to
the Swan tavern with Mr. Eglin and there drank our morning draft. Home,
and called my wife, and took her to Dr. Clodius’s to a great wedding of
Nan Hartlib to Mynheer Roder, which was kept at Goring House with very
great state, cost, and noble company. But, among all the beauties there,
my wife was thought the greatest. After dinner I left the company, and
carried my wife to Mrs. Turner’s. I went to the Attorney-General’s, and
had my bill which cost me seven pieces. I called my wife, and set her
home. And finding my Lord in White Hall garden, I got him to go to the
Secretary’s, which he did, and desired the dispatch of his and my bills
to be signed by the King. His bill is to be Earl of Sandwich, Viscount
Hinchingbroke, and Baron of St. Neot’s.

     [The motive for Sir Edward Montagu’s so suddenly altering his
     intended title is not explained; probably, the change was adopted as
     a compliment to the town of Sandwich, off which the Fleet was lying
     before it sailed to bring Charles from Scheveling.  Montagu had also
     received marked attentions from Sir John Boys and other principal
     men at Sandwich; and it may be recollected, as an additional reason,
     that one or both of the seats for that borough have usually been
     placed at the disposal of the Admiralty.  The title of Portsmouth
     was given, in 1673, for her life, to the celebrated Louise de
     Querouaille, and becoming extinct with her, was, in 1743, conferred
     upon John Wallop, Viscount Lymington, the ancestor of the present
     Earl of Portsmouth.--B.]

Home, with my mind pretty quiet: not returning, as I said I would, to
see the bride put to bed.
