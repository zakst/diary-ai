10th. Up betimes and to my office, and there sat all the morning making
a great contract with Sir W. Warren for L3,000 worth of masts; but, good
God! to see what a man might do, were I a knave, the whole business from
beginning to end being done by me out of the office, and signed to by
them upon the once reading of it to them, without the least care or
consultation either of quality, price, number, or need of them, only in
general that it was good to have a store. But I hope my pains was such,
as the King has the best bargain of masts has been bought these 27 years
in this office. Dined at home and then to my office again, many people
about business with me, and then stepped a little abroad about business
to the Wardrobe, but missed Mr. Moore, and elswhere, and in my way met
Mr. Moore, who tells me of the good peace that is made at Tangier with
the Moores, but to continue but from six months to six months, and
that the Mole is laid out, and likely to be done with great ease and
successe, we to have a quantity of ground for our cattle about the town
to our use. To my office late, and then home to supper, after writing
letters, and to bed. This day our cook maid (we having no luck in maids
now-adays), which was likely to prove a good servant, though none of the
best cooks, fell sick and is gone to her friends, having been with us
but 4 days.
