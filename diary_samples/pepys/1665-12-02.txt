2nd. Up, and discoursing with my wife, who is resolved to go to London
for good and all this day, we did agree upon giving Mr. Sheldon L10, and
Mrs. Barbary two pieces, and so I left her to go down thither to fetch
away the rest of the things and pay him the money, and so I to the
office, where very busy setting Mr. Poynter to write out my last night’s
worke, which pleases me this day, but yet it is pretty to reflect how
much I am out of confidence with what I had done upon Gibson’s discourse
with me, for fear I should have done it sillily, but Poynter likes them,
and Mr. Hater also, but yet I am afeard lest they should do it out of
flattery, so conscious I am of my ignorance. Dined with my wife at
noon and took leave of her, she being to go to London, as I said, for
altogether, and I to the office, busy till past one in the morning.
