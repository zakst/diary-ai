11th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, where mighty pleased at my wife’s beginnings of a little
Virgin’s head. To the office and did much business, and then to
Mr. Colvill’s, and with him did come to an agreement about my L2600
assignment on the Exchequer, which I had of Sir W. Warren; and, to my
great joy, I think I shall get above L100 by it, but I must leave it to
be finished on Monday. Thence to the office, and there did the remainder
of my business, and so home to supper and to bed. This afternoon I hear
as if we had landed some men upon the Dutch coasts, but I believe it is
but a foolery either in the report or the attempt.
