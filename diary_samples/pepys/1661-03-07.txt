7th. This morning Sir Williams both went to Woolwich to sell some old
provisions there. I to Whitehall, and up and down about many businesses.
Dined at my Lord’s, then to Mr. Crew to Mr. Moore, and he and I to
London to Guildhall to see the seamen paid off, but could not without
trouble, and so I took him to the Fleece tavern, where the pretty woman
that Luellin lately told me the story of dwells, but I could not see
her. Then towards home and met Spicer, D. Vines, Ruddiard, and a company
more of my old acquaintance, and went into a place to drink some ale,
and there we staid playing the fool till late, and so I home. At home
met with ill news that my hopes of getting some money for the Charles
were spoiled through Mr. Waith’s perverseness, which did so vex me
that I could not sleep at night. But I wrote a letter to him to send
to-morrow morning for him to take my money for me, and so with good
words I thought to coy with him. To bed.
