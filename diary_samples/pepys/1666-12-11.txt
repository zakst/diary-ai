11th. Up, and to the office, where we sat, and at noon home to dinner,
a small dinner because of a good supper. After dinner my wife and I by
coach to St. Clement’s Church, to Mrs. Turner’s lodgings, hard by, to
take our leaves of her. She is returning into the North to her children,
where, I perceive, her husband hath clearly got the mastery of her, and
she is likely to spend her days there, which for her sake I am a little
sorry for, though for his it is but fit she should live where he hath
a mind. Here were several people come to see and take leave of her, she
going to-morrow: among others, my Lady Mordant, which was Betty Turner,
a most homely widow, but young, and pretty rich, and good natured.
Thence, having promised to write every month to her, we home, and I to
my office, while my wife to get things together for supper. Dispatching
my business at the office. Anon come our guests, old Mr. Batelier, and
his son and daughter, Mercer, which was all our company. We had a
good venison pasty and other good cheer, and as merry as in so good,
innocent, and understanding company I could be. He is much troubled
that wines, laden by him in France before the late proclamation was out,
cannot now be brought into England, which is so much to his and other
merchants’ loss. We sat long at supper and then to talk, and so late
parted and so to bed. This day the Poll Bill was to be passed, and great
endeavours used to take away the Proviso.
