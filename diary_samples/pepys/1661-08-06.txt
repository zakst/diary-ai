6th. Up early and went to Mr. Phillips, but lost my labour, he lying
at Huntingdon last night, so I went back again and took horse and rode
thither, where I staid with Thos. Trice and Mr. Philips drinking till
noon, and then Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where he to Goody Gorum’s
and I home to my father, who could discern that I had been drinking,
which he did never see or hear of before, so I eat a bit of dinner and
went with him to Gorum’s, and there talked with Tom Trice, and then went
and took horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad,
got to Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself. The
landlady being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her
husband being there. Before supper I went to see the church, which is
a very handsome church, but I find that both here, and every where else
that I come, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.
To bed.
