17th. Up and to the office, where Mr. Coventry very angry to see things
go so coldly as they do, and I must needs say it makes me fearful every
day of having some change of the office, and the truth is, I am of late
a little guilty of being remiss myself of what I used to be, but I hope
I shall come to my old pass again, my family being now settled again.
Dined at home, and to the office, where late busy in setting all my
businesses in order, and I did a very great and a very contenting
afternoonâ€™s work. This day my aunt Wight sent my wife a new scarfe, with
a compliment for the many favours she had received of her, which is the
several things we have sent her. I am glad enough of it, for I see my
uncle is so given up to the Wights that I hope for little more of them.
So home to supper and to bed.
