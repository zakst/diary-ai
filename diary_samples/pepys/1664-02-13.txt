13th. Up, and after I had told my wife in the morning in bed the
passages yesterday with Creed my head and heart was mightily lighter
than they were before, and so up and to the office, and thence, after
sitting, at 11 o’clock with Mr. Coventry to the African House, and
there with Sir W. Ryder by agreement we looked over part of my Lord
Peterborough’s accounts, these being by Creed and Vernaty. Anon down
to dinner to a table which Mr. Coventry keeps here, out of his L300
per annum as one of the Assistants to the Royall Company, a very pretty
dinner, and good company, and excellent discourse, and so up again to
our work for an hour till the Company came to having a meeting of their
own, and so we broke up and Creed and I took coach and to Reeves,
the perspective glass maker, and there did indeed see very excellent
microscopes, which did discover a louse or mite or sand most perfectly
and largely. Being sated with that we went away (yet with a good will
were it not for my obligation to have bought one) and walked to the New
Exchange, and after a turn or two and talked I took coach and home, and
so to my office, after I had been with my wife and saw her day’s work
in ripping the silke standard, which we brought home last night, and it
will serve to line a bed, or for twenty uses, to our great content. And
there wrote fair my angry letter to my father upon that that he wrote
to my cozen Roger Pepys, which I hope will make him the more carefull
to trust to my advice for the time to come without so many needless
complaints and jealousys, which are troublesome to me because without
reason.
