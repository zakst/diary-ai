19th. Up and ready, called on by Mr. Moone, my Lord Bellases’ secretary,
who and I good friends though I have failed him in some payments. Thence
with Sir J. Minnes to the Duke of Albemarle’s, and carried all well, and
met Norwood but prevented him in desiring a meeting of the Commissioners
for Tangier. Thence to look for Sir H. [Cholmly], but he not within, he
coming to town last night. It is a remarkable thing how infinitely naked
all that end of the towne, Covent-Garden, is at this day of people;
while the City is almost as full again of people as ever it was. To the
‘Change and so home to dinner and the office, whither anon comes Sir H.
Cholmley to me, and he and I to my house, there to settle his accounts
with me, and so with great pleasure we agreed and great friends become,
I think, and he presented me upon the foot of our accounts for this
year’s service for him L100, whereof Povy must have half. Thence to the
office and wrote a letter to Norwood to satisfy him about my nonpayment
of his bill, for that do still stick in my mind. So at night home to
supper and to bed.
