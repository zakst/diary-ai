29th (Lord’s day). Up by four o’clock, and to the settling of my
own accounts, and I do find upon my monthly ballance, which I have
undertaken to keep from month to month, that I am worth L650, the
greatest sum that ever I was yet master of. I pray God give me a
thankfull, spirit, and care to improve and encrease it. To church with
my wife, who this day put on her green petticoat of flowred satin, with
fine white and gimp lace of her own putting on, which is very pretty.
Home with Sir W. Pen to dinner by appointment, and to church again in
the afternoon, and then home, Mr. Shepley coming to me about my Lord’s
accounts, and in the evening parted, and we to supper again to Sir W.
Pen. Whatever the matter is, he do much fawn upon me, and I perceive
would not fall out with me, and his daughter mighty officious to my
wife, but I shall never be deceived again by him, but do hate him and
his traitorous tricks with all my heart. It was an invitation in order
to his taking leave of us to-day, he being to go for Ireland in a few
days. So home and prayers, and to bed.
