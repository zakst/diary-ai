5th. Up, and at the office all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and
to the office to work all the afternoon again till the evening, and then
by coach to Mr. Hales’s new house, where, I find, he hath finished my
wife’s hand, which is better than the other; and here I find Harris’s
picture, done in his habit of “Henry the Fifth;” mighty like a player,
but I do not think the picture near so good as any yet he hath made for
me: however, it is pretty well, and thence through the fair home, but
saw nothing, it being late, and so home to my business at the office,
and thence to supper and to bed.
