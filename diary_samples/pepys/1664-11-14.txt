14th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten to White Hall, to the Lords of the
Admiralty, and there did our business betimes. Thence to Sir Philip
Warwicke about Navy business: and my Lord Ashly; and afterwards to my
Lord Chancellor, who is very well pleased with me, and my carrying of
his business. And so to the ‘Change, where mighty busy; and so home
to dinner, where Mr. Creed and Moore: and after dinner I to my Lord
Treasurer’s, to Sir Philip Warwicke there, and then to White Hall,
to the Duke of Albemarle, about Tangier; and then homeward to the
Coffee-house to hear newes. And it seems the Dutch, as I afterwards
found by Mr. Coventry’s letters, have stopped a ship of masts of Sir W.
Warren’s, coming for us in a Swede’s ship, which they will not release
upon Sir G. Downing’s claiming her: which appears as the first act of
hostility; and is looked upon as so by Mr. Coventry. The Elias,’ coming
from New England (Captain Hill, commander), is sunk; only the captain
and a few men saved. She foundered in the sea. So home, where infinite
busy till 12 at night, and so home to supper and to bed.
