27th. This morning our maid Dorothy and my wife parted, which though she
be a wench for her tongue not to be borne with, yet I was loth to part
with her, but I took my leave kindly of her and went out to Savill’s,
the painter, and there sat the first time for my face with him; thence
to dinner with my Lady; and so after an hour or two’s talk in divinity
with my Lady, Captain Ferrers and Mr. Moore and I to the Theatre, and
there saw “Hamlett” very well done, and so I home, and found that my
wife had been with my aunt Wight and Ferrers to wait on my Lady to-day
this afternoon, and there danced and were very merry, and my Lady very
fond as she is always of my wife. So to bed.
