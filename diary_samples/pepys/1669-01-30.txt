30th. Lay long in bed, it being a fast-day for the murder of the late
King; and so up and to church, where Dr. Hicks made a dull sermon; and
so home, and there I find W. Batelier and Balty, and they dined with us,
and I spent all the afternoon with my wife and W. Batelier talking, and
then making them read, and particularly made an end of Mr. Boyle’s Book
of Formes, which I am glad to have over, and then fell to read a French
discourse, which he hath brought over with him for me, to invite the
people of France to apply themselves to Navigation, which it do very
well, and is certainly their interest, and what will undo us in a few
years, if the King of France goes on to fit up his Navy, and encrease it
and his trade, as he hath begun. At night to supper, and after supper,
and W. Batelier gone, my wife begun another book I lately bought, called
“The State of England,” which promises well, and is worth reading, and
so after a while to bed.
