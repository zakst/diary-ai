11th (Lord’s day). Up, and expected long a new suit; but, coming not,
dressed myself in my late new black silke camelott suit; and, when fully
ready, comes my new one of coloured ferrandin, which my wife puts me out
of love with, which vexes me, but I think it is only my not being used
to wear colours which makes it look a little unusual upon me. To my
chamber and there spent the morning reading. At noon, by invitation,
comes my two cozen Joyces and their wives, my aunt James and he-cozen
Harman, his wife being ill. I had a good dinner for them, and as merry
as I could be in such company. They being gone, I out of doors a little,
to shew, forsooth, my new suit, and back again, and in going I saw poor
Dr. Burnett’s door shut; but he hath, I hear, gained great goodwill
among his neighbours; for he discovered it himself first, and caused
himself to be shut up of his own accord: which was very handsome. In
the evening comes Mr. Andrews and his wife and Mr. Hill, and staid and
played, and sung and supped, most excellent pretty company, so pleasant,
ingenious, and harmless, I cannot desire better. They gone we to bed, my
mind in great present ease.
