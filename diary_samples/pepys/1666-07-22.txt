22nd (Lord’s day). Up, and to my chamber, and there till noon mighty
busy, setting money matters and other things of mighty moment to rights
to the great content of my mind, I finding that accounts but a little
let go can never be put in order by strangers, for I cannot without
much difficulty do it myself. After dinner to them again till about
four o’clock and then walked to White Hall, where saw nobody almost but
walked up and down with Hugh May, who is a very ingenious man. Among
other things, discoursing of the present fashion of gardens to make
them plain, that we have the best walks of gravell in the world, France
having no nor Italy; and our green of our bowling allies is better than
any they have. So our business here being ayre, this is the best way,
only with a little mixture of statues, or pots, which may be handsome,
and so filled with another pot of such and such a flower or greene as
the season of the year will bear. And then for flowers, they are best
seen in a little plat by themselves; besides, their borders spoil the
walks of another garden: and then for fruit, the best way is to have
walls built circularly one within another, to the South, on purpose for
fruit, and leave the walking garden only for that use. Thence walked
through the House, where most people mighty hush and, methinks,
melancholy. I see not a smiling face through the whole Court; and, in
my conscience, they are doubtfull of the conduct again of the Generalls,
and I pray God they may not make their fears reasonable. Sir Richard
Fanshaw is lately dead at Madrid. Guyland is lately overthrowne wholly
in Barbary by the King of Tafiletta. The fleete cannot yet get clear of
the River, but expect the first wind to be out, and then to be sure they
fight. The Queene and Maids of Honour are at Tunbridge.
