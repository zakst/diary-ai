6th (Lord’s day). My pill I took last night worked very well, and I lay
long in bed and sweat to get away the itching all about my body from
head to foot, which is beginning again as it did the last winter, and
I find after I am up that it is abated. I staid at home all day and my
wife also, whom, God forgive me, I staid along with me for fear of her
seeing of Pembleton. But she and I entertained one another all day
long with great pleasure, contriving about my wife’s closet and the
bedchamber, whither we intend to go up she and I to-day. We dined alone
and supped also at night, my brother John with us, and so to prayers and
to bed.
