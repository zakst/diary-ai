10th. Musique practice a good while, then to Paul’s Churchyard, and
there I met with Dr. Fuller’s “England’s Worthys,” the first time that
I ever saw it; and so I sat down reading in it, till it was two o’clock
before I, thought of the time going, and so I rose and went home to
dinner, being much troubled that (though he had some discourse with me
about my family and arms) he says nothing at all, nor mentions us either
in Cambridgeshire or Norfolk. But I believe, indeed, our family were
never considerable. At home all the afternoon, and at night to bed.
