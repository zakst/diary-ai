12th. At it again in the morning, and then to the Office, where till
noon, and I do see great whispering among my brethren about their
replies to the Duke of York, which vexed me, though I know no reason for
it; for I have no manner of ground to fear them. At noon home to dinner,
and, after dinner, to work all the afternoon again. At home late, and so
to bed.
