13th. Early up in the morning to read “The Seaman’s Grammar and
Dictionary” I lately have got, which do please me exceeding well. At the
office all the morning, dined at home, and Mrs. Turner, The. Joyce, and
Mr. Armiger, and my father and mother with me, where they stand till I
was weary of their company and so away. Then up to my chamber, and there
set papers and things in order, and so to bed.
