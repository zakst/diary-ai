7th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and home to
dinner, and then to the office again, being pretty good friends with my
wife again, no angry words passed; but she finding fault with Mercer,
suspecting that it was she that must have told Mary, that must have told
her mistresse of my wifeâ€™s saying that she was crooked. But the truth
is, she is jealous of my kindnesse to her. After dinner, to the office,
and did a great deale of business. In the evening comes Mr. Reeves, with
a twelve-foote glasse, so I left the office and home, where I met Mr.
Batelier with my wife, in order to our going to-morrow, by agreement,
to Bow to see a dancing meeting. But, Lord! to see how soon I could
conceive evil fears and thoughts concerning them; so Reeves and I and
they up to the top of the house, and there we endeavoured to see the
moon, and Saturne and Jupiter; but the heavens proved cloudy, and so we
lost our labour, having taken pains to get things together, in order
to the managing of our long glasse. So down to supper and then to bed,
Reeves lying at my house, but good discourse I had from him: in his own
trade, concerning glasses, and so all of us late to bed. I receive fresh
intelligence that Deptford and Greenwich are now afresh exceedingly
afflicted with the sickness more than ever.
