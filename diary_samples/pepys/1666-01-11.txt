11th. Up and to the office. By and by to the Custome House to the
Farmers, there with a letter of Sir G. Carteret’s for L3000, which they
ordered to be paid me. So away back again to the office, and at noon to
dinner all of us by invitation to Sir W. Pen’s, and much other company.
Among others, Lieutenant of the Tower, and Broome, his poet, and Dr.
Whistler, and his (Sir W. Pen’s) son-in-law Lowder, servant--[lover]--to
Mrs. Margaret Pen, and Sir Edward Spragg, a merry man, that sang a
pleasant song pleasantly. Rose from table before half dined, and with
Mr. Mountney of the Custome House to the East India House, and there
delivered to him tallys for L3000 and received a note for the money on
Sir R. Viner. So ended the matter, and back to my company, where staid a
little, and thence away with my Lord Bruncker for discourse sake, and
he and I to Gresham College to have seen Mr. Hooke and a new invented
chariott of Dr. Wilkins, but met with nobody at home! So to Dr.
Wilkins’s, where I never was before, and very kindly received and met
with Dr. Merritt, and fine discourse among them to my great joy, so
sober and so ingenious. He is now upon finishing his discourse of a
universal character. So away and I home to my office about my letters,
and so home to supper and to bed.
