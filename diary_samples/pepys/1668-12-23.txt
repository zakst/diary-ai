23rd. Met at the Office all the morning, and at noon to the ‘Change,
and there met with Langford and Mr. Franke, the landlord of my father’s
house in Fleet Streete, and are come to an arbitration what my father
shall give him to be freed of his lease and building the house again.
Walked up and down the ‘Change, and among others discoursed with
Sir John Bankes, who thinks this prorogation will please all but
the Parliament itself, which will, if ever they meet, be vexed at
Buckingham, who yet governs all. He says the Nonconformists are glad of
it, and, he believes, will get the upperhand in a little time, for the
King must trust to them or nobody; and he thinks the King will be forced
to it. He says that Sir D. Gawden is mightily troubled at Pen’s being
put upon him, by the Duke of York, and that he believes he will get
clear of it, which, though it will trouble me to have Pen still at the
Office, yet I shall think D. Gawden do well in it, and what I would
advise him to, because I love him. So home to dinner, and then with my
wife alone abroad, with our new horses, the beautifullest almost that
ever I saw, and the first time they ever carried her, and me but once;
but we are mighty proud of them. To her tailor’s, and so to the ‘Change,
and laid out three or four pounds in lace, for her and me; and so home,
and there I up to my Lord Brouncker, at his lodgings, and sat with him
an hour, on purpose to talk over the wretched state of this Office at
present, according to the present hands it is made up of; wherein he do
fully concur with me, and that it is our part not only to prepare for
defending it and ourselves, against the consequences of it, but to take
the best ways we can, to make it known to the Duke of York; for, till
Sir J. Minnes be removed, and a sufficient man brought into W. Pen’s
place, when he is gone, it is impossible for this Office ever to support
itself. So home, and to supper and to bed.
