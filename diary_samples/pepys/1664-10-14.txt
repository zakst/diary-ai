14th. Up by break of day, and got to Brampton by three oâ€™clock, where my
father and mother overjoyed to see me, my mother, ready to weepe every
time she looked upon me. After dinner my father and I to the Court, and
there did all our business to my mind, as I have set down in a paper
particularly expressing our proceedings at this court. So home, where W.
Joyce full of talk and pleased with his journey, and after supper I to
bed and left my father, mother, and him laughing.
