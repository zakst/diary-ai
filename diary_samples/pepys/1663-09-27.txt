27th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay chatting with my wife a good while, then up and
got me ready and to church, without my man William, whom I have not seen
to-day, nor care, but would be glad to have him put himself far enough
out of my favour that he may not wonder to have me put him away. So home
to dinner, being a little troubled to see Pembleton out again, but I
do not discern in my wife the least memory of him. Dined, and so to my
office a little, and then to church again, where a drowsy sermon, and
so home to spend the evening with my poor wife, consulting about her
closett, clothes, and other things. At night to supper, though with
little comfort, I finding myself both head and breast in great pain, and
what troubles me most my right ear is almost deaf. It is a cold, which
God Almighty in justice did give me while I sat lewdly sporting with
Mrs. Lane the other day with the broken window in my neck. I went to bed
with a posset, being very melancholy in consideration of the loss of my
hearing.
