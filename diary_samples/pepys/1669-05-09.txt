9th (Lord’s day). Up; and, after dressing in my best suit with gold
trimming, I to the Office, and there with Gibson and Tom finishing
against to-morrow my notes upon Commanders’ Instructions; and, when
church-time, to church with my wife, leaving them at work. Dr. Mills
preached a dull sermon, and so we home to dinner; and thence by coach
to St. Andrew’s, Holborne, thinking to have heard Dr. Stillingfleete
preach, but we could not get a place, and so to St. Margaret’s,
Westminster, and there heard a sermon, and did get a place, the first
we have heard there these many years, and here at a distance I saw Betty
Michell, but she is become much a plainer woman than she was a
girl. Thence towards the Park, but too soon to go in, so went on to
Knightsbridge, and there eat and drank at “The World’s End,” where we
had good things, and then back to the Park, and there till night, being
fine weather, and much company, and so home, and after supper to bed.
This day I first left off both my waistcoats by day, and my waistcoat by
night, it being very hot weather, so hot as to make me break out, here
and there, in my hands, which vexes me to see, but is good for me.
