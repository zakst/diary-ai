14th. This morning Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I, waited upon the
Duke of York in his chamber, to give him an account of the condition of
the Navy for lack of money, and how our own very bills are offered upon
the Exchange, to be sold at 20 in the 100 loss. He is much troubled at
it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning. So I
went to my Lady’s and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke
somewhat better. After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and
there saw “The Alchymist;” and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when
the play was done and carried the Captain to Paul’s and set him down,
and me home with him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir
W. Batten there, we went and carried a bottle of wine to his house,
and there sat a while and talked, and so home to bed. At home I found
a letter from Mr. Creed of the 15th of July last, that tells me that
my Lord is rid of his pain (which was wind got into the muscles of his
right side) and his feaver, and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or
two, which do give me mighty great comfort.
