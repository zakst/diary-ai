27th (Lord’s day). Rose betimes, and to my office till church time to
write two copies of my Will fair, bearing date this day, wherein I
have given my sister Pall L500, my father for his owne and my mother’s
support L2,000, to my wife the rest of my estate, but to have L2500
secured to her, though by deducting out of what I have given my father
and my sister. I dispatched all before church time and then to church,
my wife with me. Thence home to dinner, whither come my uncle Wight, and
aunt and uncle Norbury, and Mr. Shepley. A good dinner and very merry.
After dinner we broke up and I by water to Westminster to Mrs. Martin’s,
and there sat with her and her husband and Mrs. Burrows, the pretty, an
hour or two, then to the Swan a while, and so home by water, and with my
wife by and by by water as low as Greenwich, for ayre only, and so back
again home to supper and to bed with great pleasure.
