23rd. At the office all the morning, where Sir W. Pen come, being
returned from Chatham, from considering the means of fortifying the
river Medway, by a chain at the stakes, and ships laid there with guns
to keep the enemy from coming up to burn our ships; all our care now
being to fortify ourselves against their invading us. At noon home to
dinner, and then to the office all the afternoon again, where Mr. Moore
come, who tells me that there is now no doubt made of a peace being
agreed on, the King having declared this week in Council that they would
treat at Bredagh. He gone I to my office, where busy late, and so to
supper and to bed. Vexed with our mayde Luce, our cook-mayde, who is a
good drudging servant in everything else, and pleases us, but that she
will be drunk, and hath been so last night and all this day, that she
could not make clean the house. My fear is only fire.
