10th. Up, and to the office betimes, and there all the morning very
busy causing papers to be entered and sorted to put the office in order
against the Parliament. At noon home to dinner, and then to the office
again close all the afternoon upon the same occasion with great pleasure
till late, and then with my wife and Mercer in the garden and sung, and
then home and sung, and to supper with great content, and so to bed. The
Duke of York is come back last night from Harwich, the news he brings
I know not, nor hear anything to-day from Dover, whether the enemy have
made any attempt there as was expected. This day our girle Mary, whom
Payne helped us to, to be under his daughter, when she come to be our
cook-mayde, did go away declaring that she must be where she might earn
something one day, and spend it and play away the next. But a good civil
wench, and one neither wife nor I did ever give angry word to, but she
has this silly vanity that she must play.
