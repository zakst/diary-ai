board and dined here, so that some of them and I dined together in the
Round-house, where we were very merry. Hither came the Vice-Admiral to

     the great cabin.  The floor of it is formed by the aftmost part of
     the quarter deck, and the roof of it by the poop: it is generally

France, and landed at Dover.
