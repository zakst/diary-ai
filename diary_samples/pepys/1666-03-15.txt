15th. Up and to the office, where my Lord Bruncker newly come to town,
from his being at Chatham and Harwich to spy enormities: and at noon I
with him and his lady Williams, to Captain Cocke’s, where a good dinner,
and very merry. Good news to-day upon the Exchange, that our Hamburgh
fleete is got in; and good hopes that we may soon have the like of our
Gottenburgh, and then we shall be well for this winter. Very merry at
dinner. And by and by comes in Matt. Wren from the Parliament-house;
and tells us that he and all his party of the House, which is the Court
party, are fools, and have been made so this day by the wise men of
the other side; for, after the Court party had carried it yesterday so
powerfully for the Paper-Bill,

     [It was called “A Bill for raising part of the supply for his
     Majesty by an imposition on Sealed Paper and Parchment”--B.]

yet now it is laid aside wholly, and to be supplied by a land-tax; which
it is true will do well, and will be the sooner finished, which was the
great argument for the doing of it. But then it shews them fools, that
they would not permit this to have been done six weeks ago, which they
might have had. And next, they have parted with the Paper Bill, which,
when once begun, might have proved a very good flower in the Crowne, as
any there. So do really say that they are truly outwitted by the other
side. Thence away to Sir R. Viner’s, and there chose some plate besides
twelve plates which I purpose to have with Captain Cocke’s gift of L100,
and so home and there busy late, and then home and to bed.
