10th (Lord’s day). Accidentally talking of our maids before we rose, I
said a little word that did give occasion to my wife to fall out; and
she did most vexatiously, almost all the morning, but ended most perfect
good friends; but the thoughts of the unquiet which her ripping up of
old faults will give me, did make me melancholy all day long. So about
noon, past 12, we rose, and to dinner, and then to read and talk, my
wife and I alone, for Balty was gone, who come to dine with us, and then
in the evening comes Pelting to sit and talk with us, and so to supper
and pretty merry discourse, only my mind a little vexed at the morning’s
work, but yet without any appearance. So after supper to bed.
