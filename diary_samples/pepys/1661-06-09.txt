9th (Lord’s day). This day my wife put on her black silk gown, which is
now laced all over with black gimp lace, as the fashion is, in which she
is very pretty. She and I walked to my Lady’s at the Wardrobe, and there
dined and was exceeding much made of. After dinner I left my wife there,
and I walked to Whitehall, and then went to Mr. Pierce’s and sat with
his wife a good while (who continues very pretty) till he came, and
then he and I, and Mr. Symons (dancing master), that goes to sea with my
Lord, to the Swan tavern, and there drank, and so again to White Hall,
and there met with Dean Fuller, and walked a great while with him;
among other things discoursed of the liberty the Bishop (by name the of
Galloway) takes to admit into orders any body that will; among others,
Roundtree, a simple mechanique that was a person [parson?] formerly in
the fleet. He told me he would complain of it. By and by we went and got
a sculler, and landing him at Worcester House, I and W. Howe, who came
to us at Whitehall, went to the Wardrobe, where I met with Mr. Townsend,
who is very willing he says to communicate anything for my Lord’s
advantage to me as to his business. I went up to Jane Shore’s towre, and
there W. Howe and I sang, and so took my wife and walked home, and so to
bed. After I came home a messenger came from my Lord to bid me come to
him tomorrow morning.
