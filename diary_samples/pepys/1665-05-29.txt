29th. Lay long in bed, being in some little pain of the wind collique,
then up and to the Duke of Albemarle, and so to the Swan, and there
drank at Herbertâ€™s, and so by coach home, it being kept a great holiday
through the City, for the birth and restoration of the King. To my
office, where I stood by and saw Symson the joyner do several things,
little jobbs, to the rendering of my closet handsome and the setting up
of some neat plates that Burston has for my money made me, and so home
to dinner, and then with my wife, mother, and Mercer in one boat, and I
in another, down to Woolwich. I walking from Greenwich, the others going
to and fro upon the water till my coming back, having done but little
business. So home and to supper, and, weary, to bed. We have every
where taken some prizes. Our merchants have good luck to come home
safe: Colliers from the North, and some Streights men just now. And our
Hambrough ships, of whom we were so much afeard, are safe in Hambrough.
Our fleete resolved to sail out again from Harwich in a day or two.
