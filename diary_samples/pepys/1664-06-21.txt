21st. Being weary yesterday with walking I sleep long, and at last up
and to the office, where all the morning. At home to dinner, Mr. Deane
with me. After dinner I to White Hall (setting down my wife by the
way) to a Committee of Tangier, where the Duke of Yorke, I perceive, do
attend the business very well, much better than any man there or most
of them, and my [mind] eased of some trouble I lay under for fear of his
thinking ill of me from the bad successe in the setting forth of these
crew men to Tangier. Thence with Mr. Creed, and walked in the Parke, and
so to the New Exchange, meeting Mr. Moore, and he with us. I shewed him
no friendly look, but he took no notice to me of the Wardrobe business,
which vexes me. I perceive by him my Lordâ€™s business of his family and
estate goes very ill, and runs in debt mightily. I would to God I were
clear of it, both as to my owne money and the bond of L1000, which I
stand debtor for him in, to my cozen Thomas Pepys. Thence by coach home
and to my office a little, and so to supper and to bed.
