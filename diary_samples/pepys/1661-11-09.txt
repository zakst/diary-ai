9th. At the office all the morning. At noon Mr. Davenport, Phillips, and
Mr. Wm. Bernard and Furbisher, came by appointment and dined with me,
and we were very merry. After dinner I to the Wardrobe, and there staid
talking with my Lady all the afternoon till late at night. Among other
things my Lady did mightily urge me to lay out money upon my wife, which
I perceived was a little more earnest than ordinary, and so I seemed to
be pleased with it, and do resolve to bestow a lace upon her, and what
with this and other talk, we were exceeding merry. So home at night.
