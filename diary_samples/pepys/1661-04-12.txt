12th. Up among my workmen, and about 7 o’clock comes my wife to see me
and my brother John with her, who I am glad to see, but I sent them away
because of going to the office, and there dined with Sir W. Batten,
all fish dinner, it being Good Friday. Then home and looking over my
workmen, and then into the City and saw in what forwardness all things
are for the Coronacion, which will be very magnificent. Then back again
home and to my chamber, to set down in my diary all my late journey,
which I do with great pleasure; and while I am now writing comes one
with a tickett to invite me to Captain Robert Blake’s buriall, for whose
death I am very sorry, and do much wonder at it, he being a little while
since a very likely man to live as any I knew. Since my going out of
town, there is one Alexander Rosse taken and sent to the Counter by Sir
Thomas Allen, for counterfeiting my hand to a ticket, and we this day at
the office have given order to Mr. Smith to prosecute him. To bed.
