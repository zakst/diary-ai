11th (Lord’s day). Up and to church in the best manner I have gone a
good while, that is to say, with my wife, and her woman, Mercer, along
with us, and Tom, my boy, waiting on us. A dull sermon. Home, dined,
left my wife to go to church alone, and I walked in haste being late to
the Abbey at Westminster, according to promise to meet Jane Welsh, and
there wearily walked, expecting her till 6 o’clock from three, but no
Jane came, which vexed me, only part of it I spent with Mr. Blagrave
walking in the Abbey, he telling me the whole government and discipline
of White Hall Chappell, and the caution now used against admitting any
debauched persons, which I was glad to hear, though he tells me there
are persons bad enough. Thence going home went by Jarvis’s, and there
stood Jane at the door, and so I took her in and drank with her, her
master and mistress being out of doors. She told me how she could not
come to me this afternoon, but promised another time. So I walked home
contented with my speaking with her, and walked to my uncle Wight’s,
where they were all at supper, and among others comes fair Mrs.
Margarett Wight, who indeed is very pretty. So after supper home to
prayers and to bed. This afternoon, it seems, Sir J. Minnes fell sicke
at church, and going down the gallery stairs fell down dead, but came to
himself again and is pretty well.
