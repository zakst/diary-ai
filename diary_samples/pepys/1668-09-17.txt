17th. Up, and all the morning sitting at the office, where every body
grown mighty cautious in what they do, or omit to do, and at noon comes
Knepp, with design to dine with Lord Brouncker, but she being undressed,
and there being: much company, dined with me; and after dinner I out
with her, and carried her to the playhouse; and in the way did give her
five guineas as a fairing, I having given her nothing a great while, and
her coming hither sometimes having been matter of cost to her, and so I
to St. James’s, but missed of the Duke of York, and so went back to
the King’s playhouse, and saw “Rollo, Duke of Normandy,” which, for old
acquaintance, pleased me pretty well, and so home and to my business,.
and to read again, and to bed. This evening Batelier comes to tell me
that he was going down to Cambridge to my company, to see the Fair,
which vexed me, and the more because I fear he do know that Knepp did
dine with me to-day.--[And that he might tell Mrs. Pepys.--B.]
