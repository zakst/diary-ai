12th (Lord’s day). Up, and borrowing Sir J. Minnes’s coach, to my Lord
Sandwich’s, but he was gone abroad. I sent the coach back for my wife,
my Lord a second time dining at home on purpose to meet me, he having
not dined once at home but those times since his coming from sea. I
sat down and read over the Bishop of Chichester’s’ sermon upon the
anniversary of the King’s death, much cried up, but, methinks, but a
mean sermon. By and by comes in my Lord, and he and I to talke of
many things in the Navy, one from another, in general, to see how the
greatest things are committed to very ordinary men, as to parts and
experience, to do; among others, my Lord Barkeley. We talked also of
getting W. Howe to be put into the Muster-Mastershipp in the roome
of Creed, if Creed will give way, but my Lord do it without any great
gusto, calling Howe a proud coxcomb in passion. Down to dinner, where
my wife in her new lace whiske, which, indeed, is very noble, and I much
pleased with it, and so my Lady also. Here very pleasant my Lord was
at dinner, and after dinner did look over his plate, which Burston hath
brought him to-day, and is the last of the three that he will have made.
After satisfied with that, he abroad, and I after much discourse with my
Lady about Sir G. Carteret’s son, of whom she hath some thoughts for a
husband for my Lady Jemimah, we away home by coach again, and there sang
a good while very pleasantly with Mr. Andrews and Hill. They gone; we to
supper, and betimes to bed.
