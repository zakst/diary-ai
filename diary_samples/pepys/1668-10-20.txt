20th. Up, and to the office all the morning, and then home to dinner,
having this day a new girl come to us in the room of Nell, who is
lately, about four days since, gone away, being grown lazy and proud.
This girl to stay only till we have a boy, which I intend to keep when
I have a coach, which I am now about. At this time my wife and I mighty
busy laying out money in dressing up our best chamber, and thinking of
a coach and coachman and horses, &c.; and the more because of Creed’s
being now married to Mrs. Pickering; a thing I could never have
expected, but it is done about seven or ten days since, as I hear out
of the country. At noon home to dinner, and my wife and Harman and girl
abroad to buy things, and I walked out to several places to pay debts,
and among other things to look out for a coach, and saw many; and did
light on one for which I bid L50, which do please me mightily, and I
believe I shall have it. So to my tailor’s, and the New Exchange, and so
by coach home, and there, having this day bought “The Queene of Arragon”
 play, I did get my wife and W. Batelier to read it over this night by 11
o’clock, and so to bed.
