15th. That I might not be too fine for the business I intend this day, I
did leave off my fine new cloth suit lined with plush and put on my
poor black suit, and after office done (where much business, but
little done), I to the ‘Change, and thence Bagwell’s wife with much
ado followed me through Moorfields to a blind alehouse, and there I did
caress her and eat and drink, and many hard looks and sooth the poor
wretch did give me, and I think verily was troubled at what I did, but
at last after many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would,
with great pleasure, and then in the evening, it raining, walked into
town to where she knew where she was, and then I took coach and to White
Hall to a Committee of Tangier, where, and every where else, I thank
God, I find myself growing in repute; and so home, and late, very late,
at business, nobody minding it but myself, and so home to bed, weary and
full of thoughts. Businesses grow high between the Dutch and us on every
side.
