25th (Lord’s day). In the forenoon I alone to our church, and after
dinner I went and ranged about to many churches, among the rest to the
Temple, where I heard Dr. Wilkins’ a little (late Maister of Trinity
in Cambridge). That being done to my father’s to see my mother who is
troubled much with the stone, and that being done I went home, where I
had a letter brought me from my Lord to get a ship ready to carry the
Queen’s things over to France, she being to go within five or six days.
So to supper and to bed.
