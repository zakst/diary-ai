21st. This morning Mr. Barlow had appointed for me to bring him what
form I would have the agreement between him and me to pass, which I did
to his lodgings at the Golden Eagle in the new street--[Still retains
the name New Street.]--between Fetter Lane and Shoe Lane, where he liked
it very well, and I from him went to get Mr. Spong to engross it in
duplicates. To my Lord and spoke to him about the business of the Privy
Seal for me to be sworn, though I got nothing by it, but to do Mr.
Moore a kindness, which he did give me a good answer to. Went to the Six
Clerks’ office to Mr. Spong for the writings, and dined with him at a
club at the next door, where we had three voices to sing catches. So
to my house to write letters and so to Whitehall about business of my
Lord’s concerning his creation,--[As Earl of Sandwich.]--and so home and
to bed.
