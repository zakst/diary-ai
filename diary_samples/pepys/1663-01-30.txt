30th. A solemn fast for the King’s murther, and we were forced to keep
it more than we would have done, having forgot to take any victuals into
the house. I to church in the forenoon, and Mr. Mills made a good sermon
upon David’s heart smiting him for cutting off the garment of Saul.

     [Samuel, chap.  xxiv.  v. 5, “And it came to pass afterward, that
     David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.”]

Home, and whiled away some of the afternoon at home talking with my
wife. So to my office, and all alone making up my month’s accounts,
which to my great trouble I find that I am got no further than L640.
But I have had great expenses this month. I pray God the next may be
a little better, as I hope it will. In the evening my manuscript is
brought home handsomely bound, to my full content; and now I think I
have a better collection in reference to the Navy, and shall have by
the time I have filled it, than any of my predecessors. So home and eat
something such as we have, bread and butter and milk, and so to bed.
