3d. Early in the morning to the Exchequer, where I told over what money
I had of my Lord’s and my own there, which I found to be L970. Thence to
Will’s, where Spicer and I eat our dinner of a roasted leg of pork
which Will did give us, and after that to the Theatre, where was acted
“Beggars’ Bush,” it being very well done; and here the first time that
ever I saw women come upon the stage.

     [Downes does not give the cast of this play.  After the Restoration
     the acting of female characters by women became common.  The first
     English professional actress was Mrs. Coleman, who acted Ianthe in
     Davenant’s “Siege of Rhodes,” at Rutland House in 1656.]

From thence to my father’s, where I found my mother gone by Bird, the
carrier, to Brampton, upon my uncle’s great desire, my aunt being now in
despair of life. So home.
