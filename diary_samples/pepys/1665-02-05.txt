5th (Lordâ€™s day). Lay in bed most of the morning, then up and down to my
chamber, among my new books, which is now a pleasant sight to me to
see my whole study almost of one binding. So to dinner, and all the
afternoon with W. Hewer at my office endorsing of papers there, my
business having got before me much of late. In the evening comes to
see me Mr. Sheply, lately come out of the country, who goes away again
to-morrow, a good and a very kind man to me. There come also Mr. Andrews
and Hill, and we sang very pleasantly; and so, they being gone, I and my
wife to supper, and to prayers and bed.
