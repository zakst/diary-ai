15th. My father came and drank his morning draft with me, and sat with
me till I was ready, and so he and I about the business of the cloth. By
and by I left him and went and dined with my Lady, who, now my Lord is
gone, is come to her poor housekeeping again. Then to my father’s, who
tells me what he has done, and we resolved upon two pieces of scarlet,
two of purple, and two of black, and L50 in linen. I home, taking L300
with me home from Alderman Backwell’s. After writing to my Lord to let
him know what I had done I was going to bed, but there coming the purser
of the King’s yacht for victualls presently, for the Duke of York is to
go down to-morrow, I got him to promise stowage for these things there,
and so I went to bed, bidding Will go and fetch the things from the
carrier’s hither, which about 12 o’clock were brought to my house and
laid there all night.
