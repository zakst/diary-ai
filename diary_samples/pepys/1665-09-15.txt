15th. Up, it being a cold misting morning, and so by water to the
office, where very busy upon several businesses. At noon got the
messenger, Marlow, to get me a piece of bread and butter and cheese and
a bottle of beer and ale, and so I went not out of the office but dined
off that, and my boy Tom, but the rest of my clerks went home to dinner.
Then to my business again, and by and by sent my waterman to see how
Sir W. Warren do, who is sicke, and for which I have reason to be very
sorry, he being the friend I have got most by of most friends in England
but the King: who returns me that he is pretty well again, his disease
being an ague. I by water to Deptford, thinking to have seen my
valentine, but I could not, and so come back again, and to the office,
where a little business, and thence with Captain Cocke, and there drank
a cup of good drink, which I am fain to allow myself during this plague
time, by advice of all, and not contrary to my oathe, my physician being
dead, and chyrurgeon out of the way, whose advice I am obliged to take,
and so by water home and eat my supper, and to bed, being in much pain
to think what I shall do this winter time; for go every day to Woolwich
I cannot, without endangering my life; and staying from my wife at
Greenwich is not handsome.
