16th (Lord’s day). But no purser coming in the morning for them, and I
hear that the Duke went last night, and so I am at a great loss what to
do; and so this day (though the Lord’s day) staid at home, sending
Will up and down to know what to do. Sometimes thinking to continue my
resolution of sending by the carrier to be at Deal on Wednesday next,
sometimes to send them by sea by a vessel on purpose, but am not yet
come to a resolution, but am at a very great loss and trouble in mind
what in the world to do herein. The afternoon (while Will was abroad)
I spent in reading “The Spanish Gypsey,” a play not very good, though
commended much. At night resolved to hire a Margate Hoy, who would go
away to-morrow morning, which I did, and sent the things all by him, and
put them on board about 12 this night, hoping to have them as the wind
now serves in the Downs to-morrow night. To-bed with some quiet of mind,
having sent the things away.
