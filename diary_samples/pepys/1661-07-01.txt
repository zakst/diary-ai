July 1st. This morning I went up and down into the city, to buy several
things, as I have lately done, for my house. Among other things, a fair
chest of drawers for my own chamber, and an Indian gown for myself. The
first cost me 33s., the other 34s. Home and dined there, and Theodore
Goodgroome, my singing master, with me, and then to our singing. After
that to the office, and then home.
