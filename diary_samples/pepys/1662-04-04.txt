4th. By barge Sir George, Sir Williams both and I to Deptford, and there
fell to pay off the Drake and Hampshire, then to dinner, Sir George to
his lady at his house, and Sir Wm. Pen to Woolwich, and Sir W. Batten
and I to the tavern, where much company came to us and our dinner, and
somewhat short by reason of their taking part away with them. Then to
pay the rest of the Hampshire and the Paradox, and were at it till 9 at
night, and so by night home by barge safe, and took Tom Hater with some
that the clerks had to carry home along with us in the barge, the rest
staying behind to pay tickets, but came home after us that night. So
being come home, to bed. I was much troubled to-day to see a dead man
lie floating upon the waters, and had done (they say) these four days,
and nobody takes him up to bury him, which is very barbarous.
