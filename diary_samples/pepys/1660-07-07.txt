7th. To my Lord, one with me to buy a Clerk’s place, and I did demand
L100. To the Council Chamber, where I took an order for the advance of
the salaries of the officers of the Navy, and I find mine to be raised
to L350 per annum. Thence to the Change, where I bought two fine prints
of Ragotti from Rubens, and afterwards dined with my Uncle and Aunt
Wight, where her sister Cox and her husband were. After that to Mr.
Rawlinson’s with my uncle, and thence to the Navy Office, where I began
to take an inventory of the papers, and goods, and books of the office.
To my Lord’s, late writing letters. So home to bed.
