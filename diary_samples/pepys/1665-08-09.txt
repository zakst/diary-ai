9th. Up betimes to my office, where Tom Hater to the writing of letters
with me, which have for a good while been in arreare, and we close at it
all day till night, only made a little step out for half an houre in
the morning to the Exchequer about striking of tallys, but no good done
therein, people being most out of towne. At noon T. Hater dined with
me, and so at it all the afternoon. At night home and supped, and
after reading a little in Cowleyâ€™s poems, my head being disturbed with
overmuch business to-day, I to bed.
