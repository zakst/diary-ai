22nd. Up and I found Mr. Creed below, who staid with me a while,
and then I to business all the morning. At noon to the ‘Change and
Coffee-house, where great talke of the Dutch preparing of sixty sayle of
ships. The plague grows mightily among them, both at sea and land. From
the ‘Change to dinner to Trinity House with Sir W. Rider and Cutler,
where a very good dinner. Here Sir G. Ascue dined also, who I perceive
desires to make himself known among the seamen. Thence home, there
coming to me my Lord Peterborough’s Sollicitor with a letter from him to
desire present dispatch in his business of freight, and promises me L50,
which is good newes, and I hope to do his business readily for him. This
much rejoiced me. All the afternoon at his business, and late at night
comes the Sollicitor again, and I with him at 9 o’clock to Mr. Povy’s,
and there acquainted him with the business. The money he won’t pay
without warrant, but that will be got done in a few days. So home by
coach and to bed.
