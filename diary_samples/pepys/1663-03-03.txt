3rd (Shrove Tuesday). Up and walked to the Temple, and by promise
calling Commissioner Pett, he and I to White Hall to give Mr. Coventry
an account of what we did yesterday. Thence I to the Privy Seal Office,
and there got a copy of Sir W. Pen’s grant to be assistant to Sir J.
Minnes, Comptroller, which, though there be not much in it, yet I intend
to stir up Sir J. Minnes to oppose, only to vex Sir W. Pen. Thence by
water home, and at noon, by promise, Mrs. Turner and her daughter, and
Mrs. Morrice, came along with Roger Pepys to dinner. We were as merry
as I could be, having but a bad dinner for them; but so much the better,
because of the dinner which I must have at the end of this month. And
here Mrs. The. shewed me my name upon her breast as her Valentine, which
will cost me 20s. After dinner I took them down into the wine-cellar,
and broached my tierce of claret for them. Towards the evening we
parted, and I to the office awhile, and then home to supper and to bed,
the sooner having taken some cold yesterday upon the water, which brings
me my usual pain. This afternoon Roger Pepys tells me, that for certain
the King is for all this very highly incensed at the Parliament’s late
opposing the Indulgence; which I am sorry for, and fear it will breed
great discontent.
