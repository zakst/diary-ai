17th. And the next morning got up, telling my wife of my journey, and
she with a few words got me to hire her a horse to go along with me. So
I went to my Ladyâ€™s and elsewhere to take leave, and of Mr. Townsend did
borrow a very fine side-saddle for my wife; and so after all things were
ready, she and I took coach to the end of the town towards Kingsland,
and there got upon my horse and she upon her pretty mare that I hired
for her, and she rides very well. By the mare at one time falling she
got a fall, but no harm; so we got to Ware, and there supped, and to bed
very merry and pleasant.
