8,000 men, and Don John of Austria having two horses killed under him,
was forced with one man to flee away. Sir George Carteret at the office
(after dinner, and Creed being gone, for both now and yesterday I was
afraid to have him seen by Sir G. Carteret with me, for fear that he
should increase his doubt that I am of a plot with Creed in the business
of his accounts) did tell us that upon Tuesday last, being with my Lord
Treasurer, he showed him a letter from Portugall speaking of the advance
of the Spaniards into their country, and yet that the Portuguese were
never more courageous than now; for by an old prophecy, from France,
sent thither some years, though not many since, from the French King,
it is foretold that the Spaniards should come into their country, and in
such a valley they should be all killed, and then their country should
be wholly delivered from the Spaniards. This was on Tuesday last, and
yesterday came the very first news that in this very valley they had
thus routed and killed the Spaniards, which is very strange but true.
So late at the office, and then home to supper and to bed. This noon I
received a letter from the country from my wife, wherein she seems much
pleased with the country; God continue that she may have pleasure while
she is there. She, by my Lady’s advice, desires a new petticoat of
the new silk striped stuff, very pretty. So I went to Paternoster Row’
presently, and bought her one, with Mr. Creed’s help, a very fine rich
one, the best I did see there, and much better than she desires or
expects, and sent it by Creed to Unthanke to be made against tomorrow
to send by the carrier, thinking it had been but Wednesday to-day, but
I found myself mistaken, and also the taylor being out of the way, it
could not be done, but the stuff was sent me back at night by Creed to
dispose of some other way to make, but now I shall keep it to next week.
