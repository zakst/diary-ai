6th. Up and to the office, and there sat all the morning, Mr. Coventry
and I alone, the rest being paying off of ships. Dined at home with my
wife and Gosnell, my mind much pleased with her, and after dinner sat
with them a good while, till my wife seemed to take notice of my being
at home now more than at other times. I went to the office, and there
I sat till late, doing of business, and at 9 o’clock walked to Mr.
Rawlinson’s, thinking to meet my uncle Wight there, where he was, but
a great deal of his wife’s kindred-women and I knew not whom (which Mr.
Rawlinson did seem to me to take much notice of his being led by the
nose by his wife), I went away to my office again, and doing my business
there, I went home, and after a song by Gosnell we to bed.
