24th. Up, and by water to St. James’s, having, by the way, shewn Symson
Sir W. Coventry’s chimney-pieces, in order to the making me one; and
there, after the Duke of York was ready, he called me to his closet; and
there I did long and largely show him the weakness of our Office, and
did give him advice to call us to account for our duties, which he did
take mighty well, and desired me to draw up what I would have him write
to the Office. I did lay open the whole failings of the Office, and how
it was his duty to find them, and to find fault with them, as Admiral,
especially at this time, which he agreed to, and seemed much to rely
on what I said. Thence to White Hall, and there waited to attend the
Council, but was not called in, and so home, and after dinner back with
Sir J. Minnes by coach, and there attended, all of us, the Duke of York,
and had the hearing of Mr. Pett’s business, the Master-Shipwright
at Chatham, and I believe he will be put out. But here Commissioner.
Middleton did, among others, shew his good-nature and easiness to the
Masters-Attendants, by mitigating their faults, so as, I believe, they
will come in again. So home, and to supper and to bed, the Duke of York
staying with us till almost night.
