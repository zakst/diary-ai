23rd. Up betimes and my wife; and being in as mourning a dress as we
could, at present, without cost, put ourselves into, we by Sir W. Pen’s
coach to Mrs. Turner’s, at Salisbury Court, where I find my Lord’s coach
and six horses. We staid till almost eleven o’clock, and much company
came, and anon, the corps being put into the hearse, and the scutcheons
set upon it, we all took coach, and I and my wife and Auditor Beale in
my Lord Sandwich’s coach, and went next to Mrs. Turner’s mourning coach,
and so through all the City and Shoreditch, I believe about twenty
coaches, and four or five with six and four horses. Being come thither,
I made up to the mourners, and bidding them a good journey, I took leave
and back again, and setting my wife into a hackney out of Bishopsgate
Street, I sent her home, and I to the ‘Change and Auditor Beale about
his business. Did much business at the ‘Change, and so home to dinner,
and then to my office, and there late doing business also to my great
content to see God bless me in my place and opening honest ways, I hope
to get a little money to lay up and yet to live handsomely. So to supper
and to bed. My wife having strange fits of the toothache, some times on
this, and by and by on that side of her tooth, which is not common.
