14th. All the morning at home, Mr. Berkenshaw by appointment yesterday
coming to me, and begun composition of musique, and he being gone I to
settle my papers and things in my chamber, and so after dinner in
the afternoon to the office, and thence to my chamber about several
businesses of the office and my own, and then to supper and to bed. This
day my brave vellum covers to keep pictures in, come in, which pleases
me very much.
