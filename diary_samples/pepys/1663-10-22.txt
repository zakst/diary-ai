22nd. Up to the office, where we sat till noon and then I home to
dinner, and after dinner with my wife to her study and there read some
more arithmetique, which she takes with great ease and pleasure. This
morning, hearing that the Queen grows worse again, I sent to stop the
making of my velvet cloake, till I see whether she lives or dies. So a
little abroad about several businesses, and then home and to my office
till night, and then home to supper, teach my wife, and so to bed.
