27th (Lord’s day). Before I rose, letters come to me from Portsmouth,
telling me that the Princess is now well, and my Lord Sandwich set sail
with the Queen and her yesterday from thence for France. To church,
leaving my wife sick.... at home, a poor dull sermon of a stranger.
Home, and at dinner was very angry at my people’s eating a fine pudding
(made me by Slater, the cook, last Thursday) without my wife’s leave.
To church again, a good sermon of Mr. Mills, and after sermon Sir W.
Pen and I an hour in the garden talking, and he did answer me to many
things, I asked Mr. Coventry’s opinion of me, and Sir W. Batten’s of my
Lord Sandwich, which do both please me. Then to Sir W. Batten’s, where
very merry, and here I met the Comptroller and his lady and daughter
(the first time I ever saw them) and Mrs. Turner, who and her husband
supped with us here (I having fetched my wife thither), and after supper
we fell to oysters, and then Mr. Turner went and fetched some strong
waters, and so being very merry we parted, and home to bed. This day the
parson read a proclamation at church, for the keeping of Wednesday next,
the 30th of January, a fast for the murther of the late King.
