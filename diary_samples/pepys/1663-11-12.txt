12d., and sent it back again, and after having been at the pay of a
ship this afternoon at the Treasury, I went by coach to Ludgate, and, by
pricing several there, I guess this gowne may be worth about L12 or L15.
But, however, I expect at least L50 of him. So in the evening I wrote
him a letter telling him clearly my mind, a copy of which I keep and
of his letter and so I resolve to have no more such correspondence as
I used to have but will have satisfaction of him as I do expect. So to
write my letters, and after all done I went home to supper and to bed,
my mind being pretty well at ease from my letter to Creed, and more for
my receipt this afternoon of L17 at the Treasury, for the L17 paid a
year since to the carver for his work at my house, which I did intend to
have paid myself, but, finding others to do it, I thought it not amisse
to get it too, but I am afeard that we may hear of it to our greater
prejudices hereafter.
