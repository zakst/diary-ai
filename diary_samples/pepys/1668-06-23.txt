23rd. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon home to dinner, and
so to the office again all the afternoon, and then to Westminster to
Dr. Turberville about my eyes, whom I met with: and he did discourse, I
thought, learnedly about them; and takes time before he did prescribe me
any thing, to think of it. So I away with my wife and Deb., whom I left
at Unthankeâ€™s, and so to Hercules Pillars, and there we three supped
on cold powdered beef, and thence home and in the garden walked a good
while with Deane, talking well of the Navy miscarriages and faults. So
home to bed.
