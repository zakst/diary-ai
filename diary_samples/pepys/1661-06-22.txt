22nd. Abroad all the morning about several businesses. At noon went and
dined with my Lord Crew, where very much made of by him and his lady.
Then to the Theatre, “The Alchymist,”--[Comedy by Ben Jonson, first
printed in 1612.]--which is a most incomparable play. And that being
done I met with little Luellin and Blirton, who took me to a friend’s
of theirs in Lincoln’s Inn fields, one Mr. Hodges, where we drank great
store of Rhenish wine and were very merry. So I went home, where I found
my house now very clean, which was great content to me.
