18th. Up by 5 o’clock, and so down by water to Deptford and Blackewall
to dispatch some business. So walked to Dickeshoare, and there took boat
again and home, and thence to Westminster, and attended all the morning
on the Exchequer for a quarter’s tallys for Tangier. But, Lord! to see
what a dull, heavy sort of people they are there would make a man mad.
At noon had them and carried them home, and there dined with great
content with my people, and within and at the office all the afternoon
and night, and so home to settle some papers there, and so to bed, being
not very well, having eaten too much lobster at noon at dinner with Mr.
Hollyard, he coming in and commending it so much.
