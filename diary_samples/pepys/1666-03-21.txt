21st. Lay long, and when up find Mrs. Clerk of Greenwich and her
daughter Daniel, their business among other things was a request her
daughter was to make, so I took her into my chamber, and there it was to
help her husband to the command of a little new pleasure boat building,
which I promised to assist in. And here I had opportunity ‘para baiser
elle, and toucher ses mamailles’.... Then to the office, and there did
a little business, and then to the ‘Change and did the like. So home
to dinner, and spent all the afternoon in putting some things, pictures
especially, in order, and pasting my Lady Castlemayne’s print on a
frame, which I have made handsome, and is a fine piece. So to the
office in the evening to marshall my papers of accounts presented to the
Parliament, against any future occasion to recur to them, which I did do
to my great content. So home and did some Tangier work, and so to bed.
