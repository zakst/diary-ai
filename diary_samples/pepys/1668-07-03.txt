3rd. Betimes to the office, my head full of this business. Then by coach
to the Commissioners of Accounts at Brooke House, the first time I was
ever there, and there Sir W. Turner in the chair; and present, Lord
Halifax, Thoms[on], Gregory, Dunster, and Osborne. I long with them,
and see them hot set on this matter; but I did give them proper and safe
answers. Halifax, I perceive, was industrious on my side, in behalf of
his uncle Coventry, it being the business of fir W. Warren. Vexed only
at their denial of a copy of what I set my hand to, and swore. Here till
almost two o’clock, and then home to dinner, and set down presently what
I had done and said this day, and so abroad by water to Eagle Court in
the Strand, and there to an alehouse: met Mr. Pierce, the Surgeon, and
Dr. Clerke, Waldron, Turberville, my physician for the eyes, and Lowre,
to dissect several eyes of sheep and oxen, with great pleasure, and to
my great information. But strange that this Turberville should be so
great a man, and yet, to this day, had seen no eyes dissected, or but
once, but desired this Dr. Lowre to give him the opportunity to see him
dissect some. Thence to Unthanke’s, to my wife, and carried her home,
and there walked in the garden, and so to supper and to bed.
