24th. Long with Mr. Berkenshaw in the morning at my musique practice;
finishing my song of “Gaze not on Swans,” in two parts, which pleases
me well, and I did give him L5 for this month or five weeks that he hath
taught me, which is a great deal of money and troubled me to part with
it. Thence to the Paynter s, and set again for my picture in little, and
thence over the water to Southwark to Mr. Berkenshaw’s house, and there
sat with him all the afternoon, he showing me his great card of the body
of musique, which he cries up for a rare thing, and I do believe it cost
much pains, but is not so useful as he would have it. Then we sat down
and set “Nulla, nulla sit formido,” and he has set it very finely. So
home and to supper, and then called Will up, and chid him before my wife
for refusing to go to church with the maids yesterday, and telling his
mistress that he would not be made a slave of, which vexes me. So to
bed.
