22nd. Lord’s day. All this last night it had rained hard. My brother Tom
came this morning the first time to see me, and I paid him all that I
owe my father to this day. Afterwards I went out and looked into several
churches, and so to my uncle Fenner’s, whither my wife was got before
me, and we, my father and mother, and all the Joyces, and my aunt Bell,
whom I had not seen many a year before. After dinner to White Hall (my
wife to church with K. Joyce), where I find my Lord at home, and walked
in the garden with him, he showing me all the respect that can be. I
left him and went to walk in the Park, where great endeavouring to get
into the inward Park,--[This is still railed off from St. James’s Park,
and called the Enclosure.]--but could not get in; one man was basted by
the keeper, for carrying some people over on his back through the water.
Afterwards to my Lord’s, where I staid and drank with Mr. Sheply, having
first sent to get a pair of oars. It was the first time that ever I went
by water on the Lord’s day. Home, and at night had a chapter read; and
I read prayers out of the Common Prayer Book, the first time that ever I
read prayers in this house. So to bed.
