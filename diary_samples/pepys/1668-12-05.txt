5th. Up, after a little talk with my wife, which troubled me, she being
ever since our late difference mighty watchful of sleep and dreams,
and will not be persuaded but I do dream of Deb., and do tell me that I
speak in my dreams and that this night I did cry, Huzzy, and it must
be she, and now and then I start otherwise than I used to do, she says,
which I know not, for I do not know that I dream of her more than usual,
though I cannot deny that my thoughts waking do run now and then against
my will and judgment upon her, for that only is wanting to undo me,
being now in every other thing as to my mind most happy, and may still
be so but for my own fault, if I be catched loving any body but my wife
again. So up and to the office, and at noon to dinner, and thence to
office, where late, mighty busy, and despatching much business, settling
papers in my own office, and so home to supper, and to bed. No news
stirring, but that my Lord of Ormond is likely to go to Ireland again,
which do shew that the Duke of Buckingham do not rule all so absolutely;
and that, however, we shall speedily have more changes in the Navy: and
it is certain that the Nonconformists do now preach openly in houses,
in many places, and among others the house that was heretofore Sir G.
Carteretâ€™s, in Leadenhall Streete, and have ready access to the King.
And now the great dispute is, whether this Parliament or another; and
my great design, if I continue in the Navy, is to get myself to be a
Parliament-man.
