7th. Early to White Hall to the chappell, where by Mr. Blagrave’s means
I got into his pew, and heard Dr. Creeton, the great Scotchman, preach
before the King, and Duke and Duchess, upon the words of Micah:--“Roule
yourselves in dust.” He made a most learned sermon upon the words; but,
in his application, the most comical man that ever I heard in my life.
Just such a man as Hugh Peters; saying that it had been better for the
poor Cavalier never to have come with the King into England again; for
he that hath the impudence to deny obedience to the lawful magistrate,
and to swear to the oath of allegiance, &c., was better treated
now-a-days in Newgate, than a poor Royalist, that hath suffered all his
life for the King, is at White Hall among his friends. He discoursed
much against a man’s lying with his wife in Lent, saying that he might
be as incontinent during that time with his own wife as at another time
in another man’s bed. Thence with Mr. Moore to Whitehall and walked
a little, and so to the Wardrobe to dinner, and so home to the office
about business till late at night by myself, and so home and to bed.
