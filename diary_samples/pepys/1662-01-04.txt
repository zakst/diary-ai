4th. At home most of the morning hanging up pictures, and seeing how my
pewter sconces that I have bought will become my stayres and entry, and
then with my wife by water to Westminster, whither she to her father’s
and I to Westminster Hall, and there walked a turn or two with Mr.
Chetwin (who had a dog challenged of him by another man that said it was
his, but Mr. Chetwin called the dog, and the dog at last would follow
him, and not his old master, and so Chetwin got the dog) and W. Symons,
and thence to my wife, who met me at my Lord’s lodgings, and she and I
and old East to Wilkinson’s to dinner, where we had some rost beef and
a mutton pie, and a mince-pie, but none of them pleased me. After dinner
by coach my wife and I home, and I to the office, and there till late,
and then I and my wife to Sir W. Pen’s to cards and supper, and were
merry, and much correspondence there has been between our two families
all this Christmas. So home and to bed.
