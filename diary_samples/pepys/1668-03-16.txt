16th. Up, to set my papers and books in order, and put up my plate since
my late feast, and then to Westminster, by water, with Mr. Hater, and
there, in the Hall, did walk all the morning, talking with one or other,
expecting to have our business in the House; but did now a third time
wait to no purpose, they being all this morning upon the business
of Barker’s petition about the making void the Act of Settlement in
Ireland, which makes a great deal of hot work: and, at last, finding
that by all men’s opinion they could not come to our matter today, I
with Sir W. Pen home, and there to dinner, where I find, by Willet’s
crying, that her mistress had been angry with her: but I would take no
notice of it. Busy all the afternoon at the office, and then by coach to
the Excize Office, but lost my labour, there being nobody there, and
so back again home, and after a little at the office I home, and there
spent the evening with my wife talking and singing, and so to bed with
my mind pretty well at ease. This evening W. Pen and Sir R. Ford and I
met at the first’s house to talk of our prize that is now at last come
safe over from Holland, by which I hope to receive some if not all the
benefit of my bargain with W. Batten for my share in it, which if she
had miscarried I should have doubted of my Lady Batten being left little
able to have paid me.
