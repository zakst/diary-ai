23rd. To the office all the morning. My wife and people at home busy to
get things ready for tomorrow’s dinner. At noon, without dinner, went
into the City, and there meeting with Greatorex, we went and drank a pot
of ale. He told me that he was upon a design to go to Teneriffe to try
experiments there. With him to Gresham Colledge

     [Gresham College occupied the house of Sir Thomas Gresham, in
     Bishopsgate Street, from 1596, when Lady Gresham, Sir Thomas’s
     widow, died.  The meeting which Pepys attended was an early one of
     the Royal Society, which was incorporated by royal charter in 1663.]

(where I never was before), and saw the manner of the house, and found
great company of persons of honour there; thence to my bookseller’s,
and for books, and to Stevens, the silversmith, to make clean some plate
against to-morrow, and so home, by the way paying many little debts for
wine and pictures, &c., which is my great pleasure. Home and found all
things in a hurry of business, Slater, our messenger, being here as my
cook till very late. I in my chamber all the evening looking over my
Osborn’s works and new Emanuel Thesaurus Patriarchae. So late to
bed, having ate nothing to-day but a piece of bread and cheese at the
ale-house with Greatorex, and some bread and butter at home.
