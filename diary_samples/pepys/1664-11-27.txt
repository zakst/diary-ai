27th (Lord’s day). To church in the morning, then dined at home, and
to my office, and there all the afternoon setting right my business of
flaggs, and after all my pains find reason not to be sorry, because
I think it will bring me considerable profit. In the evening come Mr.
Andrews and Hill, and we sung, with my boy, Ravenscroft’s 4-part psalms,
most admirable musique. Then (Andrews not staying) we to supper, and
after supper fell into the rarest discourse with Mr. Hill about Rome and
Italy; but most pleasant that I ever had in my life. At it very late and
then to bed.
