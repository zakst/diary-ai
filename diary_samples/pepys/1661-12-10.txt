10th. To Whitehall, and there finding Mons. Eschar to be gone, I sent my
letters by a porter to the posthouse in Southwark to be sent by despatch
to the Downs. So to dinner to my Lord Crewâ€™s by coach, and in my way
had a stop of above an hour and a half, which is a great trouble this
Parliament time, but it cannot be helped. However I got thither before
my Lord come from the House, and so dined with him, and dinner done,
home to the office, and there sat late and so home.
