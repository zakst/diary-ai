14th. Up early and by water to Whitehall to my Lord, and there had
much talk with him about getting some money for him. He told me of his
intention to get the Muster Masterâ€™s place for Mr. Pierce, the purser,
who he has a mind to carry to sea with him, and spoke very slightingly
of Mr. Creed, as that he had no opinion at all of him, but only he was
forced to make use of him because of his present accounts. Thence to
drink with Mr. Shepley and Mr. Pinkny, and so home and among my workmen
all day. In the evening Mr. Shepley came to me for some money, and so he
and I to the Mitre, and there we had good wine and a gammon of bacon.
My uncle Wight, Mr. Talbot, and others were with us, and we were pretty
merry. So at night home and to bed. Finding my head grow weak now-a-days
if I come to drink wine, and therefore hope that I shall leave it off of
myself, which I pray God I could do.
