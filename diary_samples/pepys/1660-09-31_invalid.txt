31st. This morning Captain Jowles of the “Wexford” came on board, for
whom I got commission from my Lord to be commander of the ship. Upon the
doing thereof he was to make the 20s. piece that he sent me yesterday,
up L5; wherefore he sent me a bill that he did owe me L4., which I sent
my boy to Gravesend with him, and he did give the boy L4 for me, and the
boy gave him the bill under his hand. This morning, Mr. Hill that lives
in Axe-yard was here on board with the Vice-Admiral. I did give him a
bottle of wine, and was exceedingly satisfied of the power that I have
to make my friends welcome. Many orders to make all the afternoon. At
night Mr. Sheply, Howe, Ibbott, and I supped in my cabin together.
