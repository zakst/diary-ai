27th. This morning came Mr. Berkenshaw to me and in our discourse I,
finding that he cries up his rules for most perfect (though I do grant
them to be very good, and the best I believe that ever yet were made),
and that I could not persuade him to grant wherein they were somewhat
lame, we fell to angry words, so that in a pet he flung out of my
chamber and I never stopped him, having intended to put him off today,
whether this had happened or no, because I think I have all the rules
that he hath to give. And so there remains not the practice now to do me
good, and it is not for me to continue with him at; L5 per month. So I
settled to put all his rules in fair order in a book, which was my work
all the morning till dinner. After dinner to the office till late at
night, and so home to write by the post, and so to bed.
