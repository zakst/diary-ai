27th. At the office all the morning, at noon dined at home, and then
my wife, and Deb., and I to the King’s playhouse, and saw “The Indian
Queene,” but do not doat upon Nan Marshall’s acting therein, as the
world talks of her excellence therein. Thence with my wife to buy some
linnen, L13 worth, for sheets, &c., at the new shop over against the
New Exchange; [and the master, who is] come out of London--[To the
Strand.]--since the fire, says his and other tradesmen’s retail trade is
so great here, and better than it was in London, that they believe
they shall not return, nor the city be ever so great for retail as
heretofore. So home and to my business, and to bed.
