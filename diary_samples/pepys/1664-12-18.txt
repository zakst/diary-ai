18th (Lord’s day). To church, where, God forgive me! I spent most of my
time in looking [on] my new Morena--[a brunette]--at the other side of
the church, an acquaintance of Pegg Pen’s. So home to dinner, and then
to my chamber to read Ben Johnson’s Cataline, a very excellent piece,
and so to church again, and thence we met at the office to hire ships,
being in great haste and having sent for several masters of ships to
come to us. Then home, and there Mr. Andrews and Hill come and we sung
finely, and by and by Mr. Fuller, the Parson, and supped with me, he and
a friend of his, but my musique friends would not stay supper. At
and after supper Mr. Fuller and I told many storys of apparitions and
delusions thereby, and I out with my storys of Tom Mallard. He gone, I a
little to my office, and then to prayers and to bed.
