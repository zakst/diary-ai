7th. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning, and then at noon
home to dinner, and thence my wife and I to the King’s playhouse, and
there saw “The Island Princesse,” the first time I ever saw it; and it
is a pretty good play, many good things being in it, and a good scene of
a town on fire. We sat in an upper box, and the jade Nell come and sat
in the next box; a bold merry slut, who lay laughing there upon people;
and with a comrade of hers of the Duke’s house, that come in to see the
play. Thence home and to the office to do some business, and so home to
supper and to bed.
