24th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
to the ‘Change, where everybody joyed me in our hemp ship’s coming safe,
and it seems one man, Middleburgh, did give 20 per cent. in gold last
night, three or four minutes before the newes came of her being safe.
Thence with Mr. Deane home and dined, and after dinner and a good deal
of discourse of the business of Woolwich Yard, we opened his draught of
a ship which he has made for me, and indeed it is a most excellent one
and that that I hope will be of good use to me as soon as I get a little
time, and much indebted I am to the poor man. Toward night I by coach to
Whitehall to the Tangier committee, and there spoke with my Lord and he
seems mighty kind to me, but I will try him to-morrow by a visit to see
whether he holds it or no. Then home by coach again and to my office,
where late with Captain Miners about the East India business. So home
to supper and to bed, being troubled to find myself so bound as I am,
notwithstanding all the physic that I take. This day our tryall was with
Field, and I hear that they have given him L29 damage more, which is a
strange thing, but yet not so much as formerly, nor as I was afeard of.
