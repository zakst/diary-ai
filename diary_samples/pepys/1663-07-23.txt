23rd. Up and to my office, and thence by information from, Mr. Ackworth
I went down to Woolwich, and mustered the three East India ships that
lie there, believing that there is great-juggling between the Pursers
and Clerks of the Cheque in cheating the King of the wages and victuals
of men that do not give attendance, and I found very few on board. So
to the yard, and there mustered the yard, and found many faults, and
discharged several fellows that were absent from their business. I staid
also at Mr. Ackworth’s desire at dinner with him and his wife, and there
was a simple fellow, a gentleman I believe of the Court, their kinsmen,
that threatened me I could have little discourse or begin, acquaintance
with Ackworth’s wife, and so after dinner away, with all haste home, and
there found Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten at the office, and by Sir
W. Batten’s testimony and Sir G. Carteret’s concurrence was forced to
consent to a business of Captain Cocke’s timber, as bad as anything we
have lately disputed about, and all through Mr. Coventry’s not being
with us. So up and to supper with Sir W. Batten upon a soused mullett,
very good meat, and so home and to bed.
