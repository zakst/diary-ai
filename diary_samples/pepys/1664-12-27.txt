27th. My people came to bed, after their sporting, at four o’clock in
the morning; I up at seven, and to Deptford and Woolwich in a gally; the
Duke calling to me out of the barge in which the King was with him going
down the river, to know whither I was going. I told him to Woolwich, but
was troubled afterward I should say no farther, being in a gally, lest
he think me too profuse in my journeys. Did several businesses, and then
back again by two o’clock to Sir J. Minnes’s to dinner by appointment,
where all yesterday’s company but Mr. Coventry, who could not come. Here
merry, and after an hour’s chat I down to the office, where busy late,
and then home to supper and to bed. The Comet appeared again to-night,
but duskishly. I went to bed, leaving my wife and all her folks, and
Will also, too, come to make Christmas gambolls to-night.
