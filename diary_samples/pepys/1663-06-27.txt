27th. Up by 4 o’clock and a little to my office. Then comes by agreement
Sir W. Warren, and he and I from ship to ship to see deals of all sorts,
whereby I have encreased my knowledge and with great pleasure. Then to
his yard and house, where I staid two hours or more discoursing of the
expense of the navy and the corruption of Sir W. Batten and his man
Wood that he brings or would bring to sell all that is to be sold by the
Navy. Then home to the office, where we sat a little, and at noon home
to dinner, alone, and thence, it raining hard, by water to the Temple,
and so to Lincoln’s Inn, and there walked up and down to see the new
garden which they are making, and will be very pretty, and so to walk
under the Chappell by agreement, whither Mr. Clerke our Solicitor came
to me, and he fetched Mr. Long, our Attorney in the Exchequer in the
business against Field, and I directed him to come to the best and
speediest composition he could, which he will do. So home on foot,
calling upon my brother’s and elsewhere upon business, and so home to
my office, and there wrote letters to my father and wife, and so home to
bed, taking three pills overnight.
