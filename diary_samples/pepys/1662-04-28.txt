28th (Lord’s day). Waked early, and fell talking one with another with
great pleasure of my house at Brampton and that here, and other matters.
She tells me what a rogue my boy is, and strange things he has been
found guilty of, not fit to name, which vexes [me], but most of all the
unquiett life that my mother makes my father and herself lead through
her want of reason. At last I rose, and with Tom to the French Church
at the Savoy, where I never was before--a pretty place it is--and there
they have the Common Prayer Book read in French, and, which I never saw
before, the minister do preach with his hat off, I suppose in further
conformity with our Church. So to Tom’s to dinner with my wife, and
there came Mr. Cooke, and Joyce Norton do also dine there, and after
dinner Cooke and I did talk about his journey and Tom’s within a day
or two about his mistress. And I did tell him my mind and give him my
opinion in it. So I walked home and found my house made a little clean,
and pleases me better and better, and so to church in the afternoon, and
after sermon to my study, and there did some things against to-morrow
that I go to the Duke’s, and so walked to Tom’s again, and there supped
and to bed with good content of mind.
