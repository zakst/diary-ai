6th (Lord’s day). By water to White Hall, to Sir G. Carteret, to
give him an account of the backwardness of the ships we have hired to
Portugall: at which he is much troubled. Thence to the Chappell, and
there, though crowded, heard a very honest sermon before the King by a
Canon of Christ Church, upon these words, “Having a form of godliness,
but denying,” &c. Among other things, did much insist upon the sin of
adultery: which methought might touch the King, and the more because he
forced it into his sermon, methinks, besides his text. So up and saw
the King at dinner; and thence with Sir G. Carteret to his lodgings
to dinner, with him and his lady, where I saluted her, and was well
received as a stranger by her; she seems a good lady, and all their
discourse, which was very much, was upon their sufferings and services
for the King. Yet not without some trouble, to see that some that had
been much bound to them, do now neglect them; and others again most
civil that have received least from them: and I do believe that he hath
been a good servant to the King. Thence to walk in the Park, where the
King and Duke did walk round the Park. After I was tired I went and took
boat to Milford stairs, and so to Graye’s Inn walks, the first time
I have been there this year, and it is very pleasant and full of good
company. When tired I walked to the Wardrobe, and there staid a little
with my Lady, and so by water from Paul’s Wharf (where my boat staid for
me), home and supped with my wife with Sir W. Pen, and so home and to
bed.
