3rd. Up with Sir J. Minnes, by coach, to St. James’s; and there all the
newes now of very hot preparations for the Dutch: and being with the
Duke, he told us he was resolved to make a tripp himself, and that Sir
W. Pen should go in the same ship with him. Which honour, God forgive
me! I could grudge him, for his knavery and dissimulation, though I
do not envy much the having the same place myself. Talke also of great
haste in the getting out another fleete, and building some ships; and
now it is likely we have put one another by each other’s dalliance past
a retreate. Thence with our heads full of business we broke up, and I to
my barber’s, and there only saw Jane and stroked her under the chin, and
away to the Exchange, and there long about several businesses, hoping to
get money by them, and thence home to dinner and there found Hawly. But
meeting Bagwell’s wife at the office before I went home I took her
into the office and there kissed her only. She rebuked me for doing it,
saying that did I do so much to many bodies else it would be a stain to
me. But I do not see but she takes it well enough, though in the main I
believe she is very honest. So after some kind discourse we parted, and
I home to dinner, and after dinner down to Deptford, where I found Mr.
Coventry, and there we made, an experiment of Holland’s and our cordage,
and ours outdid it a great deale, as my book of observations tells
particularly. Here we were late, and so home together by water, and I
to my office, where late, putting things in order. Mr. Bland came this
night to me to take his leave of me, he going to Tangier, wherein I wish
him good successe. So home to supper and to bed, my mind troubled at the
businesses I have to do, that I cannot mind them as I ought to do and
get money, and more that I have neglected my frequenting and seeming
more busy publicly than I have done of late in this hurry of business,
but there is time left to recover it, and I trust in God I shall.
