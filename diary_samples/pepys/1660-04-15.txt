15th (Lordâ€™s day). Up early and was trimmed by the barber in the great
cabin below. After that to put my clothes on and then to sermon, and
then to dinner, where my Lord told us that the University of Cambridge
had a mind to choose him for their burgess, which he pleased himself
with, to think that they do look upon him as a thriving man, and said
so openly at table. At dinner-time Mr. Cook came back from London with a
packet which caused my Lord to be full of thoughts all day, and at night
he bid me privately to get two commissions ready, one for Capt. Robert
Blake to be captain of the Worcester, in the room of Capt. Dekings, an
anabaptist, and one that had witnessed a great deal of discontent with
the present proceedings. The other for Capt. Coppin to come out of that
into the Newbury in the room of Blake, whereby I perceive that General
Monk do resolve to make a thorough change, to make way for the King.
From London I hear that since Lambert got out of the Tower, the
Fanatiques had held up their heads high, but I hope all that will come
to nothing. Late a writing of letters to London to get ready for Mr.
Cook. Then to bed.
