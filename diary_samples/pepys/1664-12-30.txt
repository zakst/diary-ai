30th. Lay very long in bed with my wife, it being very cold, and my wife
very full of a resolution to keepe within doors, not so much as to go
to church or see my Lady Sandwich before Easter next, which I am willing
enough to, though I seem the contrary. This and other talke kept me
a-bed till almost 10 aâ€™clock. Then up and made an end of looking over
all my papers and books and taking everything out of my chamber to have
all made clean. At noon dined, and after dinner forth to several places
to pay away money, to clear myself in all the world, and, among others,
paid my bookseller L6 for books I had from him this day, and the
silversmith L22 18s. for spoons, forks, and sugar box, and being well
pleased with seeing my business done to my mind as to my meeting with
people and having my books ready for me, I home and to my office, and
there did business late, and then home to supper, prayers, and to bed.
