August 1st. This morning Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs.
Margarett Pen (this first time that I have seen her since she came from
Ireland) went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs. Browne, where
I did give her six silver spoons--[But not the porringer of silver.
See May 29th, 1661.--M. B]--for her boy. Here we had a venison pasty,
brought hot from London, and were very merry. Only I hear how nurse’s
husband has spoken strangely of my Lady Batten how she was such a man’s
whore, who indeed is known to leave her her estate, which we would fain
have reconciled to-day, but could not and indeed I do believe that the
story is true. Back again at night home.
