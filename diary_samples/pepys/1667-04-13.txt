13th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and strange
how the false fellow Commissioner. Pett was eager to have had Carcasses
business brought on to-day that he might give my Lord Bruncker (who
hates him, I am sure, and hath spoke as much against him to the King
in my hearing as any man) a cast of his office in pleading for his man
Carcasse, but I did prevent its being brought on to-day, and so broke
up, and I home to dinner, and after dinner with a little singing with
some pleasure alone with my poor wife, and then to the office, where
sat all the afternoon till late at night, and then home to supper and to
bed, my eyes troubling me still after candle-light, which troubles me.
Wrote to my father, who, I am glad to hear, is at some ease again, and I
long to have him in town, that I may see what can be done for him
here; for I would fain do all I can that I may have him live, and take
pleasure in my doing well in the world. This afternoon come Mrs. Lowther
to me to the office, and there je did toker ses mammailles and did
baiser them and su bocca, which she took fort willingly....
