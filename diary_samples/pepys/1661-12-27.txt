27th. In the morning to my Bookseller’s to bespeak a Stephens’s
Thesaurus, for which I offer L4, to give to Paul’s School; and from
thence to Paul’s Church; and there I heard Dr. Gunning preach a good
sermon upon the day (being St. John’s day), and did hear him tell a
story, which he did persuade us to believe to be true, that St. John and
the Virgin Mary did appear to Gregory, a Bishopp, at his prayer to be
confirmed in the faith, which I did wonder to hear from him. Here I
met with Mr. Crumlum (and told him of my endeavour to get Stephens’s
Thesaurus for the school), and so home, and after dinner comes Mr.
Faulconberge to see me, and at his desire I sent over for his kinsman
Mr. Knightly, the merchant, and so he came over and sat and drank with
us, and at his request I went over with him, and there I sat till the
evening, and till both Mr. Knightly and Mr. Faulconberge (for whom I
sent my boy to get a coach to carry him to Westminster) were both drunk,
and so home, but better wine I never drank in all my life. So home, and
finding my wife gone to Sir W. Pen’s, I went thither, and there I sat
and played at cards and supped, and so home and to bed.
