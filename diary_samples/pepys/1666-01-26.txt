26th. Up, and pleased mightily with what my poor wife hath been doing
these eight or ten days with her owne hands, like a drudge in fitting
the new hangings of our bed-chamber of blue, and putting the old red
ones into my dressing-room, and so by coach to White Hall, where I had
just now notice that Sir G. Carteret is come to towne. He seems pleased,
but I perceive he is heartily troubled at this Act, and the report of
his losing his place, and more at my not writing to him to the prejudice
of the Act. But I carry all fair to him and he to me. He bemoans the
Kingdom as in a sad state, and with too much reason I doubt, having so
many enemys about us and no friends abroad, nor money nor love at
home. Thence to the Duke of Albemarle, and there a meeting with all
the officers of the Navy, where, Lord! to see how the Duke of Albemarle
flatters himself with false hopes of money and victuals and all without
reason. Then comes the Committee of Tangier to sit, and I there carry
all before me very well. Thence with Sir J. Bankes and Mr. Gawden to
the ‘Change, they both very wise men. After ‘Change and agreeing with
Houblon about our ships, D. Gawden and I to the Pope’s Head and there
dined and little Chaplin (who a rich man grown). He gone after dinner,
D. Gawden and I to talke of the Victualling business of the Navy in what
posture it is, which is very sad also for want of money. Thence home to
my chamber by oathe to finish my Journall. Here W. Hewer came to me with
L320 from Sir W. Warren, whereof L220 is got clearly by a late business
of insurance of the Gottenburg ships, and the other L100 which was due
and he had promised me before to give me to my very extraordinary joy,
for which I ought and do bless God and so to my office, where late
providing a letter to send to Mr. Gawden in a manner we concluded on
to-day, and so to bed.
