21st. At the office all the morning. At noon all of us dined at Captain
Cockeâ€™s at a good chine of beef, and other good meat; but, being all
frost-bitten, was most of it unroast; but very merry, and a good dish of
fowle we dressed ourselves. Mr. Evelyn there, in very good humour. All
the afternoon till night pleasant, and then I took my leave of them and
to the office, where I wrote my letters, and away home, my head full of
business and some trouble for my letting my accounts go so far that I
have made an oathe this night for the drinking no wine, &c., on such
penalties till I have passed my accounts and cleared all. Coming home
and going to bed, the boy tells me his sister Daniel has provided me a
supper of little birds killed by her husband, and I made her sup with
me, and after supper were alone a great while, and I had the pleasure of
her lips, she being a pretty woman, and one whom a great belly becomes
as well as ever I saw any. She gone, I to bed. This day I was come to by
Mrs. Burrows, of Westminster, Lieutenant Burrows (lately dead) his wife,
a most pretty woman and my old acquaintance; I had a kiss or two of her,
and a most modest woman she is.
