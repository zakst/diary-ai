24th. Up betimes, and with my salt eel

     [A salt eel is a rope’s end cut from the piece to be used on the
     back of a culprit.  “Yeow shall have salt eel for supper” is an
     emphatic threat.]

went down in the parler and there got my boy and did beat him till I was
fain to take breath two or three times, yet for all I am afeard it will
make the boy never the better, he is grown so hardened in his tricks,
which I am sorry for, he being capable of making a brave man, and is
a boy that I and my wife love very well. So made me ready, and to my
office, where all the morning, and at noon home, whither came Captain
Holland, who is lately come home from sea, and has been much harassed in
law about the ship which he has bought, so that it seems in a despair
he endeavoured to cut his own throat, but is recovered it; and it seems
whether by that or any other persuasion (his wife’s mother being a great
zealot) he is turned almost a Quaker, his discourse being nothing but
holy, and that impertinent, that I was weary of him. At last pretending
to go to the Change we walked thither together, and there I left him and
home to dinner, sending my boy by the way to enquire after two dancing
masters at our end of the town for my wife to learn, of whose names
the boy brought word. After dinner all the afternoon fiddling upon my
viallin (which I have not done many a day) while Ashwell danced above in
my upper best chamber, which is a rare room for musique, expecting this
afternoon my wife to bring my cozen Scott and Stradwick, but they came
not, and so in the evening we by ourselves to Half-way house to walk,
but did not go in there, but only a walk and so home again and to
supper, my father with us, and had a good lobster intended for part of
our entertainment to these people to-day, and so to cards, and then
to bed, being the first day that I have spent so much to my pleasure a
great while.
