14th (Lord’s day). Up, and to my office with Tom, whom I made to read to
me the books of Propositions in the time of the Grand Commission,
which I did read a good part of before church, and then with my wife to
church, where I did see my milliner’s wife come again, which pleased
me; but I durst not be seen to mind her for fear of my wife’s seeing me,
though the woman I did never speak twenty words to, and that but only
in her husband’s shop. But so fearful I am of discontenting my wife, or
giving her cause of jealousy. But here we heard a most excellent
good sermon of Mr. Gifford’s, upon the righteousness of Scribes and
Pharisees. So home to dinner and to work again, and so till dinner,
where W. Howe come and dined with me, and staid and read in my Lord
Cooke upon his chapter of perjury again, which pleased me, and so
parted, and I to my office, and there made an end of the books of
Propositions, which did please me mightily to hear read, they being
excellently writ and much to the purpose, and yet so as I think I shall
make good use of his defence of our present constitution. About four
o’clock took coach to visit my cozen Turner, and I out with her to make
a visit, but the lady she went to see was abroad. So back and to talk
with her and her daughters, and then home, and she and I to walk in the
garden, the first time this year, the weather being mighty temperate;
and then I to write down my Journall for the last week, my eyes being
very bad, and therefore I forced to find a way to use by turns with my
tube, one after another, and so home to supper and to bed. Before I went
from my office this night I did tell Tom my resolution not to keep him
after Jane was gone, but shall do well by him, which pleases him; and I
think he will presently marry her, and go away out of my house with her.
