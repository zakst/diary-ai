3rd. Up, and at the office all the morning, and at noon to Mr. Cutler’s,
and there dined with Sir W. Rider and him, and thence Sir W. Rider and I
by coach to White Hall to a Committee of the Fishery; there only to
hear Sir Edward Ford’s proposal about farthings, wherein, O God! to see
almost every body interested for him; only my Lord Annesly, who is a
grave, serious man. My Lord Barkeley was there, but is the most hot,
fiery man in discourse, without any cause, that ever I saw, even to
breach of civility to my Lord Anglesey, in his discourse opposing to my
Lord’s. At last, though without much satisfaction to me, it was voted
that it should be requested of the King, and that Sir Edward Ford’s
proposal is the best yet made. Thence by coach home. The Duke of Yorke
being expected to-night with great joy from Portsmouth, after his having
been abroad at sea three or four days with the fleete; and the Dutch are
all drawn into their harbours. But it seems like a victory: and a matter
of some reputation to us it is, and blemish to them; but in no degree
like what it is esteemed at, the weather requiring them to do so. Home
and at my office late, and then to supper and to bed.
