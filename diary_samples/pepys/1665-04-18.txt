18th. Up and to Sir Philip Warwicke, and walked with him an houre with
great delight in the Parke about Sir G. Carteret’s accounts, and the
endeavours that he hath made to bring Sir G. Carteret to show his
accounts and let the world see what he receives and what he pays. Thence
home to the office, where I find Sir J. Minnes come home from Chatham,
and Sir W. Batten both this morning from Harwich, where they have
been these 7 or 8 days. At noon with my wife and Mr. Moore by water to
Chelsey about my Privy Seale for Tangier, but my Lord Privy Seale was
gone abroad, and so we, without going out of the boat, forced to return,
and found him not at White Hall. So I to Sir Philip Warwicke and with
him to my Lord Treasurer, who signed my commission for Tangier-Treasurer
and the docquet of my Privy Seale, for the monies to be paid to me.
Thence to White Hall to Mr. Moore again, and not finding my Lord I home,
taking my wife and woman up at Unthanke’s. Late at my office, then to
supper and to bed.
