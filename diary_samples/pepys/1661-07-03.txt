3rd. To Westminster to Mr. Edward Montagu about business of my Lord’s,
and so to the Wardrobe, and there dined with my Lady, who is in some
mourning for her brother, Mr. Saml. Crew, who died yesterday of the
spotted fever. So home through Duck Lane’ to inquire for some Spanish
books, but found none that pleased me. So to the office, and that being
done to Sir W. Batten’s with the Comptroller, where we sat late talking
and disputing with Mr. Mills the parson of our parish. This day my
Lady Batten and my wife were at the burial of a daughter of Sir John
Lawson’s, and had rings for themselves and their husbands. Home and to
bed.
