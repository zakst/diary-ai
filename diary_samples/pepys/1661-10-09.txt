9th. This morning went out about my affairs, among others to put my
Theorbo out to be mended, and then at noon home again, thinking to go
with Sir Williams both to dinner by invitation to Sir W. Rider’s, but at
home I found Mrs. Pierce, la belle, and Madam Clifford, with whom I was
forced to stay, and made them the most welcome I could; and I was (God
knows) very well pleased with their beautiful company, and after dinner
took them to the Theatre, and shewed them “The Chances;” and so saw
them both at home and back to the Fleece tavern, in Covent Garden, where
Luellin and Blurton, and my old friend Frank Bagge, was to meet me, and
there staid till late very merry. Frank Bagge tells me a story of Mrs.
Pepys that lived with my Lady Harvy, Mr. Montagu’s sister, a good woman;
that she had been very ill, and often asked for me; that she is in good
condition, and that nobody could get her to make her will; but that she
did still enquire for me, and that now she is well she desires to have
a chamber at my house. Now I do not know whether this is a trick of
Bagge’s, or a good will of hers to do something for me; but I will not
trust her, but told him I should be glad to see her, and that I would be
sure to do all that I could to provide a place for her. So by coach home
late.
