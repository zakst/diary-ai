7th (Lord’s day). Up and to church, and thence home, my wife being ill
... kept her bed all day, and I up and dined by her bedside, and then
all the afternoon till late at night writing some letters of business
to my father stating of matters to him in general of great import, and
other letters to ease my mind in the week days that I have not time
to think of, and so up to my wife, and with great mirth read Sir W.
Davenant’s two speeches in dispraise of London and Paris, by way of
reproach one to another, and so to prayers and to bed.
