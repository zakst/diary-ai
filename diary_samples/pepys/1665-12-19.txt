19th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon by agreement
comes Hatcham Pepys to dine with me. I thought to have had him to Sir
J. Minnes to a good venison pasty with the rest of my fellows, being
invited, but seeing much company I went away with him and had a good
dinner at home. He did give me letters he hath wrote to my Lord and
Moore about my Lord’s money to get it paid to my cozen, which I will
make good use of. I made mighty much of him, but a sorry dull fellow he
is, fit for nothing that is ingenious, nor is there a turd of kindnesse
or service to be had from him. So I shall neglect him if I could get but
him satisfied about this money that I may be out of bonds for my Lord
to him. To see that this fellow could desire me to helpe him to some
employment, if it were but of L100 per annum: when he is not worth less
than, I believe, L20,000. He gone, I to Sir J. Minnes, and thence with
my Lord Bruncker on board the Bezan to examine W. Howe again, who I find
upon this tryall one of much more wit and ingenuity in his answers than
ever I expected, he being very cunning and discreet and well spoken in
them. I said little to him or concerning him; but, Lord! to see how
he writes to me a-days, and styles me “My Honour.” So much is a man
subjected and dejected under afflictions as to flatter me in that manner
on this occasion. Back with my Lord to Sir J. Minnes, where I left him
and the rest of a great deale of company, and so I to my office, where
late writing letters and then home to bed.
