23rd. Up betimes and to my office, where setting down my journall
while I was in the country to this day, and at noon by water to my Lord
Crew’s, and there dined with him and Sir Thomas, thinking to have them
inquire something about my Lord’s lodgings at Chelsey, or any thing of
that sort, but they did not, nor seem to take the least notice of it,
which is their discretion, though it might be better for my Lord and
them too if they did, that so we might advise together for the best,
which cannot be while we seem ignorant one to another, and it is not
fit for me to begin the discourse. Thence walked to several places about
business and to Westminster Hall, thinking to meet Mrs. Lane, which is
my great vanity upon me at present, but I must correct it. She was not
in the way. So by water home and to my office, whither by and by came my
brother John, who is to go to Cambridge to-morrow, and I did give him
a most severe reprimand for his bad account he gives me of his studies.
This I did with great passion and sharp words, which I was sorry to
be forced to say, but that I think it for his good, forswearing doing
anything for him, and that which I have yet, and now do give him, is
against my heart, and will also be hereafter, till I do see him give
me a better account of his studies. I was sorry to see him give me no
answer, but, for aught I see, to hear me without great resentment, and
such as I should have had: in his condition. But I have done my duty,
let him do his, for I am resolved to be as good as my word. After two
hours walking in the garden, till after it was dark, I ended with him
and to my office, and there set some papers in order, and so to supper,
and my poor wife, who is mighty busy at home; fitting her closet. So to
bed.
