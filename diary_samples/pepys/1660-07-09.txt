9th. All the morning at Sir G. Palmerâ€™s advising about getting my bill
drawn. From thence to the Navy office, where in the afternoon we met and
sat, and there I begun to sign bills in the Office the first time. From
thence Captain Holland and Mr. Browne of Harwich took me to a tavern and
did give me a collation. From thence to the Temple to further my bills
being done, and so home to my Lord, and thence to bed.
