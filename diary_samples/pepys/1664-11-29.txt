29th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten to the Committee of Lords at the
Council Chamber, where Sir G. Carteret told us what he had said to
the King, and how the King inclines to our request of making us
Commissioners of the Prize office, but meeting him anon in the gallery,
he tells me that my Lord Barkely is angry we should not acquaint him
with it, so I found out my Lord and pacified him, but I know not whether
he was so in earnest or no, for he looked very frowardly. Thence to the
Parliament House, and with Sir W. Batten home and dined with him, my
wife being gone to my Lady Sandwichâ€™s, and then to the office, where we
sat all the afternoon, and I at my office till past 12 at night, and so
home to bed. This day I hear that the King should say that the Dutch do
begin to comply with him. Sir John Robinson told Sir W. Batten that he
heard the King say so. I pray God it may be so.
