4th. Lay long talking pleasantly with my wife in bed, it having rained,
and do still, very much all night long. Up and to the office, where
we sat till noon. This morning we had news by letters that Sir Richard
Stayner is dead at sea in the Mary, which is now come into Portsmouth
from Lisbon; which we are sorry for, he being a very stout seaman. But
there will be no great miss of him for all that. Dined at home with my
wife, and all the afternoon among my workmen, and at night to my office
to do business there, and then to see Sir W. Pen, who is still sick, but
his pain less than it was. He took occasion to talk with me about Sir J.
Minnesâ€™s intention to divide the entry and the yard, and so to keep him
out of the yard, and forcing him to go through the garden to his house.
Which he is vexed at, and I am glad to see that Sir J. Minnes do use him
just as he do me, and so I perceive it is not anything extraordinary
his carriage to me in the matter of our houses, for this is worse than
anything he has done to me, that he should give order for the stopping
up of his way to his house without so much as advising with him or
letting of him know it, and I confess that it is very highly and basely
done of him. So to my office again, and after doing business there, then
home to supper and to bed.
