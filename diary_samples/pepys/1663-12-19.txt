19th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and I laboured
hard at Deering’s business of his deals more than I would if I did not
think to get something, though I do really believe that I did what is
to the King’s advantage in it, and yet, God knows, the expectation of
profit will have its force and make a man the more earnest. Dined at
home, and then with Mr. Bland to another meeting upon his arbitration,
and seeing we were likely to do no good I even put them upon it, and
they chose Sir W. Rider alone to end the matter, and so I am rid of it.
Thence by coach to my shoemaker’s and paid all there, and gave something
to the boys’ box against Christmas. To Mrs. Turner’s, whom I find busy
with Sir W. Turner, about advising upon going down to Norfolke with the
corps, and I find him in talke a sober, considering man. So home to
my office late, and then home to supper and to bed. My head full of
business, but pretty good content.
