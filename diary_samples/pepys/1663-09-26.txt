26th. Up and to my office, and there we sat till noon, and then I to the
Exchange, but did little there, but meeting Mr. Rawlinson he would needs
have me home to dinner, and Mr. Deane of Woolwich being with me I took
him with me, and there we dined very well at his own dinner, only no
invitation, but here I sat with little pleasure, considering my wife at
home alone, and so I made what haste home I could, and was forced to sit
down again at dinner with her, being unwilling to neglect her by being
known to dine abroad. My doing so being only to keep Deane from dining
at home with me, being doubtful what I have to eat. So to the office,
and there till late at night, and so home to supper and bed, being
mightily pleased to find my wife so mindful of her house.
