16th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning; at noon home to
dinner, and then to the office again in the afternoon, and there all
day very busy till night, and then, having done much business, home to
supper, and so to bed. This afternoon come home Sir J. Minnes, who has
been down, but with little purpose, to pay the ships below at the Nore.
This evening, having done my letters, I did write out the heads of
what I had prepared to speak to the King the other day at my Lord
Treasurerâ€™s, which I do think convenient to keep by me for future
use. The weather is now grown warm again, after much cold; and it is
observable that within these eight days I did see smoke remaining,
coming out of some cellars, from the late great fire, now above six
months since. There was this day at the office (as he is most days) Sir
W. Warren, against whom I did manifestly plead, and heartily too, God
forgive me! But the reason is because I do find that he do now wholly
rely almost upon my Lord Bruncker, though I confess I have no greater
ground of my leaving him than the confidence which I perceive he hath
got in my Lord Bruncker, whose seeming favours only do obtain of him as
much compensation as, I believe (for he do know well the way of using
his bounties), as mine more real. Besides, my Lord and I being become
antagonistic, I do not think it safe for me to trust myself in the hands
of one whom I know to be a knave, and using all means to become gracious
there.
