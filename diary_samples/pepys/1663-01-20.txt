20th. Up betimes and to the office, where all the morning. Dined at
home, and Mr. Deane of Woolwich with me, talking about the abuses of
the yard. Then to the office about business all the afternoon with great
pleasure, seeing myself observed by every body to be the only man of
business of us all, but Mr. Coventry. So till late at night, and then
home to supper and bed.
