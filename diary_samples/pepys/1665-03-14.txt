14th. Up before six, to the office, where busy all the morning. At noon
dined with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, at the Tower, with Sir J.
Robinson, at a farewell dinner which he gives Major Holmes at his going
out of the Tower, where he hath for some time, since his coming from
Guinny, been a prisoner, and, it seems, had presented the Lieutenant
with fifty pieces yesterday. Here a great deale of good victuals and
company. Thence home to my office, where very late, and home to supper
and to bed weary of business.
