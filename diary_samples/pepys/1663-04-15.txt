15th. Up betimes, and after talking with my father awhile, I to my
office, and there hard at it till almost noon, and then went down the
river with Maynes, the purveyor, to show a ship’s lading of Norway
goods, and called at Sir W. Warren’s yard, and so home to dinner. After
dinner up with my wife and Ashwell a little to the Tryangle, and so I
down to Deptford by land about looking out a couple of catches fitted
to be speedily set forth in answer to a letter of Mr. Coventry’s to
me. Which done, I walked back again, all the way reading of my book of
Timber measure, comparing it with my new Sliding Rule brought home this
morning with great pleasure. Taking boat again I went to Shishe’s yard,
but he being newly gone out towards Deptford I followed him thither
again, and there seeing him I went with him and pitched upon a couple,
and so by water home, it being late, past 8 at night, the wind cold, and
I a little weary. So home to my office, then to supper and bed.
