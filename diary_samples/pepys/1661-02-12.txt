12th. To my Lord’s, and there with him all the morning, and then (he
going out to dinner) I and Mr. Pickering, Creed, and Captain Ferrers
to the Leg in the Palace to dinner, where strange Pickering’s
impertinences. Thence the two others and I after a great dispute whither
to go, we went by water to Salsbury Court play-house, where not liking
to sit, we went out again, and by coach to the Theatre, and there saw
“The Scornfull Lady,” now done by a woman, which makes the play appear
much better than ever it did to me. Then Creed and I (the other being
lost in the crowd) to drink a cup of ale at Temple Bar, and there we
parted, and I (seeing my father and mother by the way) went home.
