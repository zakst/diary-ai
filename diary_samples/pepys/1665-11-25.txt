25th. Up, and busy at the office all day long, saving dinner time, and
in the afternoon also very late at my office, and so home to bed. All
our business is now about our Hambro fleete, whether it can go or no
this yeare, the weather being set in frosty, and the whole stay being
for want of Pilotts now, which I have wrote to the Trinity House about,
but have so poor an account from them, that I did acquaint Sir W.
Coventry with it this post.
