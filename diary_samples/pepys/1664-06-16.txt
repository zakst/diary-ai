16th. I lay in my drawers and stockings and wastecoate till five of the
clock, and so up; and being well pleased with our frolique, walked to
Knightsbridge, and there eat a messe of creame, and so to St. James’s,
and there walked a little, and so I to White Hall, and took coach, and
found my wife well got home last night, and now in bed. So I to the
office, where all the morning, and at noon to the ‘Change, so home and
to my office, where Mr. Ackworth came to me (though he knows himself
and I know him to be a very knave), yet he came to me to discover the
knavery of other people like the most honest man in the world. However,
good use I shall make of his discourse, for in this he is much in the
right. He being gone I to the ‘Change, Mr. Creed with me, after we had
been by water to see a vessell we have hired to carry more soldiers to
Tangier, and also visited a rope ground, wherein I learnt several useful
things. The talk upon the ‘Change is, that De Ruyter is dead, with
fifty men of his own ship, of the plague, at Cales: that the Holland
Embassador here do endeavour to sweeten us with fair words; and things
likely to be peaceable. Home after I had spoke with my cozen Richard
Pepys upon the ‘Change, about supplying us with bewpers from Norwich,
which I should be glad of, if cheap. So home to supper and bed.
