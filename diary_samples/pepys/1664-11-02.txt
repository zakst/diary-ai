2nd. Up betimes, and down with Mr. Castle to Redriffe, and there walked
to Deptford to view a parcel of brave knees--[Knees of timber]--of
his, which indeed are very good, and so back again home, I seeming very
friendly to him, though I know him to be a rogue, and one that hates
me with his heart. Home and to dinner, and so to my office all the
afternoon, where in some pain in my backe, which troubled me, but I
think it comes only with stooping, and from no other matter. At night
to Nellsonâ€™s, and up and down about business, and so home to my office,
then home to supper and to bed.
