2nd. Lay pretty long in bed. So up and by water to St. James’s, and
there attended the Duke with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, and having
done our work with him walked to Westminster Hall, and after walking
there and talking of business met Mr. Rawlinson and by coach to the
‘Change, where I did some business, and home to dinner, and presently by
coach to the King’s Play-house to see “The Labyrinth,” but, coming too
soon, walked to my Lord’s to hear how my Lady do, who is pretty well;
at least past all fear. There by Captain Ferrers meeting with an
opportunity of my Lord’s coach, to carry us to the Parke anon, we
directed it to come to the play-house door; and so we walked, my wife
and I and Madamoiselle. I paid for her going in, and there saw “The
Labyrinth,” the poorest play, methinks, that ever I saw, there being
nothing in it but the odd accidents that fell out, by a lady’s being
bred up in man’s apparel, and a man in a woman’s. Here was Mrs. Stewart,
who is indeed very pretty, but not like my Lady Castlemayne, for all
that. Thence in the coach to the Parke, where no pleasure; there being
much dust, little company, and one of our horses almost spoiled
by falling down, and getting his leg over the pole; but all mended
presently, and after riding up and down, home. Set Madamoiselle at home;
and we home, and to my office, whither comes Mr. Bland, and pays me the
debt he acknowledged he owed me for my service in his business of
the Tangier Merchant, twenty pieces of new gold, a pleasant sight. It
cheered my heart; and he being gone, I home to supper, and shewed them
my wife; and she, poor wretch, would fain have kept them to look on,
without any other design but a simple love to them; but I thought it not
convenient, and so took them into my own hand. So, after supper, to bed.
