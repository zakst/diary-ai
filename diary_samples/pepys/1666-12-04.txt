4th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon dined
at home. After dinner presently to my office, and there late and then
home to even my Journall and accounts, and then to supper much eased in
mind, and last nightâ€™s good news, which is more and more confirmed with
particulars to very good purpose, and so to bed.
