2s.; menders of the highway, 2s. Pleasant country to Bedford, where,
while they stay, I rode through the town; and a good country-town; and
there, drinking, 1s. We on to Newport; and there ‘light, and I and W.
Hewer to the Church, and there give the boy 1s. So to Buckingham, a good
old town. Here I to see the Church, which very good, and the leads, and
a school in it: did give the sexton’s boy 1s. A fair bridge here,
with many arches: vexed at my people’s making me lose so much time;
reckoning, 13s. 4d. Mighty pleased with the pleasure of the ground
all the day. At night to Newport Pagnell; and there a good pleasant
country-town, but few people in it. A very fair--and like a
Cathedral--Church; and I saw the leads, and a vault that goes far under
ground, and here lay with Betty Turner’s sparrow: the town, and so most
of this country, well watered. Lay here well, and rose next day by four
o’clock: few people in the town: and so away. Reckoning for supper, 19s.
