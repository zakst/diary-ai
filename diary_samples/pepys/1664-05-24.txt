24th. Up and to the office, where Sir J. Minnes and I sat all the
morning, and after dinner thither again, and all the afternoon hard at
the office till night, and so tired home to supper and to bed. This day
I heard that my uncle Fenner is dead, which makes me a little sad, to
see with what speed a great many of my friends are gone, and more, I
fear, for my fatherâ€™s sake, are going.
