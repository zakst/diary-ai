23rd. Up by four o’clock, and so to my office; but before I went out,
calling, as I have of late done, for my boy’s copybook, I found that
he had not done his task; so I beat him, and then went up to fetch
my rope’s end, but before I got down the boy was gone. I searched the
cellar with a candle, and from top to bottom could not find him high nor
low. So to the office; and after an hour or two, by water to the
Temple, to my cozen Roger; who, I perceive, is a deadly high man in the
Parliament business, and against the Court, showing me how they have
computed that the King hath spent, at least hath received, about four
millions of money since he came in: and in Sir J. Winter’s case, in
which I spoke to him, he is so high that he says he deserves to be
hanged, and all the high words he could give, which I was sorry to see,
though I am confident he means well. Thence by water home, and to the
‘Change; and by and by comes the King and the Queen by in great state,
and the streets full of people. I stood in Mr.--------‘s balcone. They
dine all at my Lord Mayor’s; but what he do for victuals, or room for
them, I know not. So home to dinner alone, and there I found that my boy
had got out of doors, and came in for his hat and band, and so is gone
away to his brother; but I do resolve even to let him go away for good
and all. So I by and by to the office, and there had a great fray with
Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, who, like an old dotard, is led by the
nose by him. It was in Captain Cocke’s business of hemp, wherein the
King is absolutely abused; but I was for peace sake contented to be
quiet and to sign to his bill, but in my manner so as to justify myself,
and so all was well; but to see what a knave Sir W. Batten is makes my
heart ake. So late at my office, and then home to supper and to bed, my
man Will not being well.
