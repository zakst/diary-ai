7th. Up, and after with my flageolet and Mr. Townsend, whom I sent for
to come to me to discourse about my Lord Sandwich’s business; for whom I
am in some pain, lest the Accounts of the Wardrobe may not be in so good
order as may please the new Lords Treasurers, who are quick-sighted, and
under obligations of recommending themselves to the King and the world,
by their finding and mending of faults, and are, most of them, not the
best friends to my Lord, and to the office, and there all the morning.
At noon home to dinner, my father, wife, and I, and a good dinner, and
then to the office again, where busy all the afternoon, also I have a
desire to dispatch all business that hath lain long on my hands, and so
to it till the evening, and then home to sing and pipe with my wife, and
then to supper and to bed, my head full of thoughts how to keep if I can
some part of my wages as Surveyor of the Victualling, which I see
must now come to be taken away among the other places that have been
occasioned by this war, and the rather because I have of late an
inclination to keep a coach. Ever since my drinking, two days ago, some
very Goole drink at Sir W. Coventry’s table I have been full of wind
and with some pain, and I was afraid last night that it would amount to
much, but, blessed be God! I find that the worst is past, so that I do
clearly see that all the indisposition I am liable to-day as to
sickness is only the Colique. This day I read (shown me by Mr. Gibson)
a discourse newly come forth of the King of France, his pretence to
Flanders, which is a very fine discourse, and the truth is, hath so
much of the Civil Law in it, that I am not a fit judge of it, but, as it
appears to me, he hath a good pretence to it by right of his Queene. So
to bed.
