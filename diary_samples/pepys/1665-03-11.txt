11th. Up and to the office, at noon home to dinner, and to the office
again, where very late, and then home to supper and to bed. This day
returned Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes from Lee Roade, where they have
been to see the wrecke of “The London,” out of which, they say, the
guns may be got, but the hull of her will be wholly lost, as not being
capable of being weighed.
