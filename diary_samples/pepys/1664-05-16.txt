16th. Forced to rise because of going to the Duke to St. James’s, where
we did our usual business, and thence by invitation to Mr. Pierces the
chyrurgeon, where I saw his wife, whom I had not seen in many months
before. She holds her complexion still, but in everything else, even in
this her new house and the best rooms in it, and her closet which
her husband with some vainglory took me to show me, she continues the
eeriest slattern that ever I knew in my life. By and by we to see an
experiment of killing a dogg by letting opium into his hind leg. He and
Dr. Clerke did fail mightily in hitting the vein, and in effect did not
do the business after many trials; but with the little they got in, the
dogg did presently fall asleep, and so lay till we cut him up, and a
little dogg also, which they put it down his throate; he also staggered
first, and then fell asleep, and so continued. Whether he recovered or
no, after I was gone, I know not, but it is a strange and sudden effect.
Thence walked to Westminster Hall, where the King was expected to come
to prorogue the House, but it seems, afterwards I hear, he did not
come. I promised to go again to Mr. Pierce’s, but my pain grew so great,
besides a bruise I got to-day in my right testicle, which now vexes me
as much as the other, that I was mighty melancholy, and so by coach
home and there took another glyster, but find little good by it, but
by sitting still my pain of my bruise went away, and so after supper to
bed, my wife and I having talked and concluded upon sending my father an
offer of having Pall come to us to be with us for her preferment, if by
any means I can get her a husband here, which, though it be some trouble
to us, yet it will be better than to have her stay there till nobody
will have her and then be flung upon my hands.
