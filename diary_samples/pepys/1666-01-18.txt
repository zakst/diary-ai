18th. Up before day and thence rode to London before office time, where
I met a note at the doore to invite me to supper to Mrs. Pierces because
of Mrs. Knipp, who is in towne and at her house: To the office, where,
among other things, vexed with Major Norwood’s coming, who takes it ill
my not paying a bill of Exchange of his, but I have good reason for it,
and so the less troubled, but yet troubled, so as at noon being carried
by my Lord Bruncker to Captain Cocke’s to dinner, where Mrs. Williams
was, and Mrs. Knipp, I was not heartily merry, though a glasse of wine
did a little cheer me. After dinner to the office. Anon comes to me
thither my Lord Bruncker, Mrs. Williams, and Knipp. I brought down my
wife in her night-gowne, she not being indeed very well, to the office
to them and there by and by they parted all and my wife and I anon and
Mercer, by coach, to Pierces; where mighty merry, and sing and dance
with great pleasure; and I danced, who never did in company in my life,
and Captain Cocke come for a little while and danced, but went away, but
we staid and had a pretty supper, and spent till two in the morning, but
got home well by coach, though as dark as pitch, and so to bed.
