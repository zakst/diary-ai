7th. Up, and having set my neighbour, Mr. Hudson, wine coopers, at work
drawing out a tierce of wine for the sending of some of it to my wife,
I abroad, only taking notice to what a condition it hath pleased God
to bring me that at this time I have two tierces of Claret, two quarter
casks of Canary, and a smaller vessel of Sack; a vessel of Tent, another
of Malaga, and another of white wine, all in my wine cellar together;
which, I believe, none of my friends of my name now alive ever had of
his owne at one time. To Westminster, and there with Mr. Povy and Creed
talking of our Tangier business, and by and by I drew Creed aside and
acquainted him with what Sir G. Carteret did tell me about Backewell the
other day, because he hath money of his in his hands. So home, taking
some new books, L5 worth, home to my great content. At home all the day
after busy. Some excellent discourse and advice of Sir W. Warrenâ€™s in
the afternoon, at night home to look over my new books, and so late to
bed.
