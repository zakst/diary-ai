28th. At the office betimes (it being cold all night and this morning,
and a very great frost they say abroad, which is much, having had no
summer at all almost), where we sat, and in the afternoon also about
settling the establishment of the number of men borne on ships, &c.,
till the evening, and after that in my closet till late, and quite tired
with business, home to supper and to bed.
