20th. Up betimes and to my office, where I found my brother Tom, who
tells me that his mistressâ€™s mother has wrote a letter to Mr. Lull of
her full satisfaction about Tom, of which I was glad, and do think the
business will take. All this morning we sat at the office, Sir J. Minnes
and I. And so dined at home, and among my workmen all the afternoon, and
in the evening Tom brought Mr. Lull to me, a friend of his mistress, a
serious man, with whom I spoke, and he gives me a good account of her
and of their satisfaction in Tom, all which pleases me well. We walked
a good while in the garden together, and did give him a glass of wine
at my office, and so parted. So to write letters by the post and news
of this to my father concerning Tom, and so home to supper and to my
lodgings and to bed. To-night my barber sent me his man to trim me, who
did live in King Street in Westminster lately, and tells me that three
or four that I knew in that street, tradesmen, are lately fallen mad,
and some of them dead, and the others continue mad. They live all within
a door or two one of another.
