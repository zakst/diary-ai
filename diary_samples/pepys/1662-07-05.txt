5th. To my office all the morning, to get things ready against our
sitting, and by and by we sat and did business all the morning, and
at noon had Sir W. Pen, who I hate with all my heart for his base
treacherous tricks, but yet I think it not policy to declare it yet, and
his son William, to my house to dinner, where was also Mr. Creed and my
cozen Harry Alcocke. I having some venison given me a day or two ago,
and so I had a shoulder roasted, another baked, and the umbles

     [The umbles are the liver, kidneys, and other portions of the inside
     of the deer.  They were usually made into pies, and old cookery
     books contain directions for the making of ‘umble pies.’]

baked in a pie, and all very well done. We were merry as I could be in
that company, and the more because I would not seem otherwise to Sir W.
Pen, he being within a day or two to go for Ireland. After dinner he
and his son went away, and Mr. Creed would, with all his rhetoric,
have persuaded me to have gone to a play; and in good earnest I find
my nature desirous to have gone, notwithstanding my promise and my
business, to which I have lately kept myself so close, but I did refuse
it, and I hope shall ever do so, and above all things it is considerable
that my mind was never in my life in so good a condition of quiet as
it has been since I have followed my business and seen myself to get
greater and greater fitness in my employment, and honour every day more
than other. So at my office all the afternoon, and then my mathematiques
at night with Mr. Cooper, and so to supper and to bed.
