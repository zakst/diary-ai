9th. Up and to my workmen, who are at work close again, and I at the
office all the morning, and there do hear by a messenger that Roger
Pepys would speak with me, so before the office up I to Westminster, and
there find the House very busy, and like to be so all day, about my Lord
Chancellor’s impeachment, whether treason or not, where every body is
mighty busy. I spoke with my cozen Roger, whose business was only to
give me notice that Carcasse hath been before the Committee; and to warn
me of it, which is a great courtesy in him to do, and I desire him to
continue to do so. This business of this fellow, though it may be a
foolish thing, yet it troubles me, and I do plainly see my weakness
that I am not a man able to go through trouble, as other men, but that
I should be a miserable man if I should meet with adversity, which God
keep me from! He desirous to get back into the House, he having his
notes in his hand, the lawyers being now speaking to the point of
whether treason or not treason, the article of advising the King to
break up the Parliament, and to govern by the sword. Thence I down to
the Hall, and there met Mr. King, the Parliament-man for Harwich, and
there he did shew, and let me take a copy of, all the articles against
my Lord Chancellor, and what members they were that undertook to bring
witnesses to make them good, of which I was mighty glad, and so away
home, and to dinner and to my workmen, and in the afternoon out to get
Simpson the joyner to come to work at my office, and so back home and to
my letters by the post to-night, and there, by W. Pen, do hear that this
article was overvoted in the House not to be a ground of impeachment of
treason, at which I was glad, being willing to have no blood spilt, if
I could help it. So home to supper, and glad that the dirty bricklayers’
work of my office is done, and home to supper and to bed.
