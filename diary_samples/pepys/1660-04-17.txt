17th. All the morning getting ready commissions for the Vice-Admiral and
the Rear-Admiral, wherein my Lord was very careful to express the
utmost of his own power, commanding them to obey what orders they should
receive from the Parliament, &c., or both or either of the Generals.

     [Sir Edward Montagu afterwards recommended the Duke of York as High
     Admiral, to give regular and lawful commissions to the Commanders of
     the Fleet, instead of those which they had received from Sir Edward
     himself, or from the Rump Parliament.--Kennett’s Register, p. 163.]

The Vice-Admiral dined with us, and in the afternoon my Lord called
me to give him the commission for him, which I did, and he gave it him
himself. A very pleasant afternoon, and I upon the deck all the day, it
was so clear that my Lord’s glass shewed us Calais very plain, and the
cliffs were as plain to be seen as Kent, and my Lord at first made me
believe that it was Kent. At night, after supper, my Lord called for
the Rear-Admiral’s commission, which I brought him, and I sitting in
my study heard my Lord discourse with him concerning D. King’s and
Newberry’s being put out of commission. And by the way I did observe
that my Lord did speak more openly his mind to me afterwards at night
than I can find that he did to the Rear-Admiral, though his great
confidant. For I was with him an hour together, when he told me clearly
his thoughts that the King would carry it, and that he did think himself
very happy that he was now at sea, as well for his own sake, as that he
thought he might do his country some service in keeping things quiet.
To bed, and shifting myself from top to toe, there being J. Goods and W.
Howe sat late by my bedside talking. So to sleep, every day bringing me
a fresh sense of the pleasure of my present life.
