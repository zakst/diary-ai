19th. Lay in bed, it being Lord’s day, all the morning talking with
my wife, sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased, and then up and to
dinner. All the afternoon also at home, and Sir W. Batten’s, and in the
evening comes Mr. Andrews, and we sung together, and then to supper, he
not staying, and at supper hearing by accident of my mayds their letting
in a rogueing Scotch woman that haunts the office, to helpe them to
washe and scoure in our house, and that very lately, I fell mightily
out, and made my wife, to the disturbance of the house and neighbours,
to beat our little girle, and then we shut her down into the cellar, and
there she lay all night. So we to bed.
