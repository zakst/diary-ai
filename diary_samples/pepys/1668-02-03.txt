3rd. Up, and to the office, where with my clerks all the morning very
busy about several things there wherein I was behindhand. At noon home
to dinner, and thence after dinner to the Duke of York’s house, to the
play, “The Tempest,” which we have often seen, but yet I was pleased
again, and shall be again to see it, it is so full of variety, and
particularly this day I took pleasure to learn the tune of the seaman’s
dance, which I have much desired to be perfect in, and have made myself
so. So home with my wife and Deb., and there at the office met to
my trouble with a warrant from the Commissioners of Accounts for my
attending them and Cocke two days hence, which I apprehend by Captain
Cocke’s being to go also, to be about the prizes. But, however, there is
nothing of crime can be laid to my charge, and the worst that can be is
to refund my L500 profit, and who can help it. So I resolve not to be
troubled at it, though I fear I cannot bear it so, my spirit being very
poor and mean as to the bearing with trouble that I do find of myself.
So home, and there to my chamber and did some business,--and thence to
supper and to bed.
