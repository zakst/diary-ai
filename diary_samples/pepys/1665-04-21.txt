21st. Up and to my office about business. Anon comes Creed and Povy, and
we treat about the business of our lending money, Creed and I, upon a
tally for the satisfying of Andrews, and did conclude it as in papers
is expressed, and as I am glad to have an opportunity of having 10 per
cent. for my money, so I am as glad that the sum I begin this trade with
is no more than L350. We all dined at Andrews’ charge at the Sun behind
the ‘Change, a good dinner the worst dressed that ever I eat any, then
home, and there found Kate Joyce and Harman come to see us. With them,
after long talk, abroad by coach, a tour in the fields, and drunk at
Islington, it being very pleasant, the dust being laid by a little rain,
and so home very well pleased with this day’s work. So after a while at
my office to supper and to bed. This day we hear that the Duke and the
fleete are sailed yesterday. Pray God go along with them, that they have
good speed in the beginning of their worke.
