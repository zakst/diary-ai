13th. At home all the morning, being by the cold weather, which for
these two days has been frost, in some pain in my bladder. Dined at home
and then with my wife to the Paynter’s, and there she sat the first
time to be drawn, while I all the while stood looking on a pretty lady’s
picture, whose face did please me extremely. At last, he having done,
I found that the dead colour of my wife is good, above what I expected,
which pleased me exceedingly. So home and to the office about some
special business, where Sir Williams both were, and from thence with
them to the Steelyard, where my Lady Batten and others came to us, and
there we drank and had musique and Captain Cox’s company, and he paid
all, and so late back again home by coach, and so to bed.
