26th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
I to the â€˜Change, and there met with Mr. Cutler the merchant, who would
needs have me home to his house by the Dutch Church, and there in an old
but good house, with his wife and mother, a couple of plain old women,
I dined a good plain dinner, and his discourse after dinner with me upon
matters of the navy victualling very good and worth my hearing, and so
home to my office in the afternoon with my mind full of business, and
there at it late, and so home to supper to my poor wife, and to bed,
myself being in a little pain..... by a stroke.... in pulling up my
breeches yesterday over eagerly, but I will lay nothing to it till I see
whether it will cease of itself or no. The plague, it seems, grows more
and more at Amsterdam; and we are going upon making of all ships coming
from thence and Hambrough, or any other infected places, to perform
their Quarantine (for thirty days as Sir Rd. Browne expressed it in the
order of the Council, contrary to the import of the word, though in the
general acceptation it signifies now the thing, not the time spent in
doing it) in Holehaven, a thing never done by us before.
