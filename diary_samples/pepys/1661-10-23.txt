23rd. To Whitehall, and there, to drink our morning, Sir W. Pen and I to
a friend’s lodging of his (Col. Pr. Swell), and at noon he and I dined
together alone at the Legg in King Street, and so by coach to Chelsy to
my Lord Privy Seal’s about business of Sir William’s, in which we had a
fair admittance to talk with my Lord, and had his answer, and so back to
the Opera, and there I saw again “Love and Honour,” and a very good play
it is. And thence home, calling by the way to see Sir Robert Slingsby,
who continues ill, and so home. This day all our office is invited
against Tuesday next, my Lord Mayor’s day, to dinner with him at
Guildhall. This evening Mr. Holliard came and sat with us, and gave us
both directions to observe.
