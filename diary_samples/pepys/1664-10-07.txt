7th. Lay pretty while with some discontent abed, even to the having
bad words with my wife, and blows too, about the ill-serving up of
our victuals yesterday; but all ended in love, and so I rose and to
my office busy all the morning. At noon dined at home, and then to my
office again, and then abroad to look after callicos for flags, and hope
to get a small matter by my pains therein and yet save the King a great
deal of money, and so home to my office, and there came Mr. Cocker, and
brought me a globe of glasse, and a frame of oyled paper, as I desired,
to show me the manner of his gaining light to grave by, and to lessen
the glaringnesse of it at pleasure by an oyled paper. This I bought of
him, giving him a crowne for it; and so, well satisfied, he went away,
and I to my business again, and so home to supper, prayers, and to bed.
