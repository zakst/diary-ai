24th (Lordâ€™s day). In my chamber all the morning (having lain long in
bed) till Mr. Shepley come to dine with me, and there being to return
to Hinchinbroke speedily, I did give him as good account how matters go
here as I could. After dinner, he being gone, I to the office, and there
for want of other of my clerks, sent to Mr. Gibbs, whom I never used
till now, for the writing over of my little pocket Contract-book; and
there I laboured till nine at night with him, in drawing up the history
of all that hath passed concerning tickets, in order to the laying the
whole, and clearing myself and Office, before Sir R. Brookes; and in
this I took great pains, and then sent him away, and proceeded, and
had W. Hewer come to me, and he and I till past twelve at night in
the Office, and he, which was a good service, did so inform me in the
consequences of my writing this report, and that what I said would not
hold water, in denying this Board to have ever ordered the discharging
out of the service whole ships by ticket, that I did alter my whole
counsel, and fall to arme myself with good reasons to justify the Office
in so doing, which hath been but rare, and having done this, I went,
with great quiet in my mind, home, though vexed that so honest a
business should bring me so much trouble; but mightily was pleased to
find myself put out of my former design; and so, after supper, to bed.
