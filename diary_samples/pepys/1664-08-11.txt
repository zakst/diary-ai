11th. Up, and through pain, to my great grief forced to wear my gowne
to keep my legs warm. At the office all the morning, and there a high
dispute against Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen about the breadth of canvas
again, they being for the making of it narrower, I and Mr. Coventry and
Sir J. Minnes for the keeping it broader. So home to dinner, and by and
by comes Mr. Creed, lately come from the Downes, and dined with me. I
show him a good countenance, but love him not for his base ingratitude
to me. However, abroad, carried my wife to buy things at the New
Exchange, and so to my Lady Sandwich’s, and there merry, talking with
her a great while, and so home, whither comes Cocker with my rule, which
he hath engraved to admiration, for goodness and smallness of work: it
cost me 14s. the doing, and mightily pleased I am with it. By and by, he
gone, comes Mr. Moore and staid talking with me a great while about
my Lord’s businesses, which I fear will be in a bad condition for his
family if my Lord should miscarry at sea. He gone, I late to my office,
and cannot forbear admiring and consulting my new rule, and so home to
supper and to bed. This day, for a wager before the King, my Lords of
Castlehaven and Arran (a son of my Lord of Ormond’s), they two alone did
run down and kill a stoute bucke in St. James’s parke.
