31st (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and to church, where I have not been these many
weeks. So home, and thither, inviting him yesterday, comes Mr. Hill, at
which I was a little troubled, but made up all very well, carrying him
with me to Sir J. Minnes, where I was invited and all our families to a
venison pasty. Here good cheer and good discourse. After dinner Mr.
Hill and I to my house, and there to musique all the afternoon. He being
gone, in the evening I to my accounts, and to my great joy and with
great thanks to Almighty God, I do find myself most clearly worth L1014,
the first time that ever I was worth L1000 before, which is the height
of all that ever I have for a long time pretended to. But by the
blessing of God upon my care I hope to lay up something more in a little
time, if this business of the victualling of Tangier goes on as I hope
it will. So with praise to God for this state of fortune that I am
brought to as to wealth, and my condition being as I have at large set
it down two days ago in this book, I home to supper and to bed, desiring
God to give me the grace to make good use of what I have and continue my
care and diligence to gain more.
