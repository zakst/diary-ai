9th. To the Privy Seal in the morning, but my Lord did not come, so I
went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King’s Privy Kitchen
to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, and there we had a good slice of beef
or two to our breakfast, and from thence he took us into the wine cellar
where, by my troth, we were very merry, and I drank too much wine, and
all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but I drank
so much wine that I was not fit for business, and therefore at noon I
went and walked in Westminster Hall a while, and thence to Salisbury
Court play house, where was acted the first time “‘Tis pity Shee’s a
Whore,” a simple play and ill acted, only it was my fortune to sit by a
most pretty and most ingenious lady, which pleased me much. Thence home,
and found Sir Williams both and much more company gone to the Dolphin
to drink the 30s. that we got the other day of Sir W. Pen about his
tankard. Here was Sir R. Slingsby, Holmes, Captn. Allen, Mr. Turner,
his wife and daughter, my Lady Batten, and Mrs. Martha, &c., and an
excellent company of fiddlers; so we exceeding merry till late; and
then we begun to tell Sir W. Pen the business, but he had been drinking
to-day, and so is almost gone, that we could not make him understand it,
which caused us more sport. But so much the better, for I believe when
he do come to understand it he will be angry, he has so talked of the
business himself and the letter up and down that he will be ashamed to
be found abused in it. So home and to bed.
