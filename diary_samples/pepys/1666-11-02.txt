2nd. Up betimes, and with Sir W. Batten to Woolwich, where first we went
on board the Ruby, French prize, the only ship of war we have taken
from any of our enemies this year. It seems a very good ship, but with
galleries quite round the sterne to walk in as a balcone, which will
be taken down. She had also about forty good brass guns, but will make
little amends to our loss in The Prince. Thence to the Ropeyarde and the
other yards to do several businesses, he and I also did buy some apples
and pork; by the same token the butcher commended it as the best in
England for cloath and colour. And for his beef, says he, “Look how fat
it is; the lean appears only here and there a speck, like beauty-spots.”
 Having done at Woolwich, we to Deptford (it being very cold upon the
water), and there did also a little more business, and so home, I
reading all the why to make end of the “Bondman” (which the oftener I
read the more I like), and begun “The Duchesse of Malfy;” which seems a
good play. At home to dinner, and there come Mr. Pierce, surgeon, to
see me, and after I had eat something, he and I and my wife by coach to
Westminster, she set us down at White Hall, and she to her brother’s. I
up into the House, and among other things walked a good while with the
Serjeant Trumpet, who tells me, as I wished, that the King’s Italian
here is about setting three parts for trumpets, and shall teach some to
sound them, and believes they will be admirable musique. I also walked
with Sir Stephen Fox an houre, and good discourse of publique business
with him, who seems very much satisfied with my discourse, and desired
more of my acquaintance. Then comes out the King and Duke of York from
the Council, and so I spoke awhile to Sir W. Coventry about some office
business, and so called my wife (her brother being now a little better
than he was), and so home, and I to my chamber to do some business, and
then to supper and to bed.
