8, then to Thames Street along with old Mr. Green, among the tarr-men,
and did instruct myself in the nature and prices of tarr, but could not
get Stockholm for the use of the office under L10 15s. per last, which
is a great price. So home, and at noon Dr. T. Pepys came to me, and he
and I to the Exchequer, and so back to dinner, where by chance comes Mr.
Pierce, the chyrurgeon, and then Mr. Battersby, the minister, and then
Mr. Dun, and it happened that I had a haunch of venison boiled, and so
they were very wellcome and merry; but my simple Dr. do talk so like a
fool that I am weary of him. They being gone, to my office again, and
there all the afternoon, and at night home and took a few turns with my
wife in the garden and so to bed. My house being this day almost quite
untiled in order to its rising higher. This night I began to put on my
waistcoat also. I found the pageant in Cornhill taken down, which was
pretty strange.
