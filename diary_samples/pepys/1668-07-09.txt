9th. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning, and after noon
to the office again till night, mighty busy getting Mr. Fist to come and
help me, my own clerks all busy, and so in the evening to ease my eyes,
and with my wife and Deb. and Betty Turner, by coach to Unthankeâ€™s and
back again, and then to supper and to bed.
