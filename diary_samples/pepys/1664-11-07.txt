7th. Up and with Sir W. Batten to White Hall, where mighty thrusting
about the Duke now upon his going. We were with him long. He advised us
to follow our business close, and to be directed in his absence by
the Committee of the Councell for the Navy. By and by a meeting of the
Fishery, where the Duke was, but in such haste, and things looked so
superficially over, that I had not a fit opportunity to propose my paper
that I wrote yesterday, but I had chewed it to Mr. Gray and Wren before,
who did like it most highly, as they said, and I think they would not
dissemble in that manner in a business of this nature, but I see the
greatest businesses are done so superficially that I wonder anything
succeeds at all among us, that is publique. Thence somewhat vexed to
see myself frustrated in the good I hoped to have done and a little
reputation to have gained, and thence to my barber’s, but Jane not being
in the way I to my Lady Sandwich’s, and there met my wife and dined, but
I find that I dine as well myself, that is, as neatly, and my meat as
good and well-dressed, as my good Lady do, in the absence of my Lord.
Thence by water I to my barber’s again, and did meet in the street my
Jane, but could not talk with her, but only a word or two, and so by
coach called my wife, and home, where at my office late, and then, it
being washing day, to supper and to bed.
