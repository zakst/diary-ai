28th. My tailor come to me betimes this morning, and having given him
directions, I to the office and there all the morning. At noon dined
well. Balty, who is mighty thoughtful how to dispose of his wife, and
would fain have me provide a place for her, which the thoughts of what
I should do with her if he should miscarry at sea makes me avoid the
offering him that she should be at my house. I find he is plainly
jealous of her being in any place where she may have ill company, and
I do pity him for it, and would be glad to help him, and will if I can.
Having dined, I down by water with Sir W. Batten, [Sir] W. Pen,
and [Sir] R. Ford to our prize, part of whose goods were condemned
yesterday--“The Lindeboome”--and there we did drink some of her wine,
very good. But it did grate my heart to see the poor master come on
board, and look about into every corner, and find fault that she was not
so clean as she used to be, though methought she was very clean; and
to see his new masters come in, that had nothing to do with her, did
trouble me to see him. Thence to Blackwall and there to Mr. Johnson’s,
to see how some works upon some of our repaired ships go on, and at his
house eat and drank and mighty extraordinary merry (too merry for me
whose mother died so lately, but they know it not, so cannot reproach
me therein, though I reproach myself), and in going home had many good
stories of Sir W. Batten and one of Sir W. Pen, the most tedious and
silly and troublesome (he forcing us to hear him) that ever I heard
in my life. So to the office awhile, troubled with Sir W. Pen’s
impertinences, he being half foxed at Johnson’s, and so to bed.
