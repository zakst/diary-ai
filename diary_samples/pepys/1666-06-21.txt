21st. Up, and at the office all the morning; whereby several
circumstances I find Sir W. Coventry and the Duke of Albemarle do not
agree as they used to do; Sir W. Coventry commending Aylett (in some
reproach to the Duke), whom the Duke hath put out for want of courage;
and found fault with Steward, whom the Duke keeps in, though as much in
fault as any commander in the fleete. At noon home to dinner, my father,
sister, and wife dining at Sarah Giles’s, poor woman, where I should
have been, but my pride would not suffer me. After dinner to Mr.
Debasty’s to speake with Sir Robert Viner, a fine house and a great
many fine ladies. He used me mighty civilly. My business was to set the
matter right about the letter of credit he did give my Lord Belassis,
that I may take up the tallys lodged with Viner for his security in the
answering of my Lord’s bills, which we did set right very well, and
Sir Robert Viner went home with me and did give me the L5000 tallys
presently. Here at Mr. Debasty’s I saw, in a gold frame, a picture of a
Outer playing on his flute which, for a good while, I took for paynting,
but at last observed it a piece of tapestry, and is the finest that ever
I saw in my life for figures, and good natural colours, and a very fine
thing it is indeed. So home and met Sir George Smith by the way, who
tells me that this day my Lord Chancellor and some of the Court have
been with the City, and the City have voted to lend the King L100,000;
which, if soon paid (as he says he believes it will), will be a greater
service than I did ever expect at this time from the City. So home to
my letters and then with my wife in the garden, and then upon our leades
singing in the evening and so to supper (while at supper comes young
Michell, whose wife I love, little Betty Howlet, to get my favour
about a ticket, and I am glad of this occasion of obliging him and give
occasion of his coming to me, for I must be better acquainted with him
and her), and after supper to bed.
