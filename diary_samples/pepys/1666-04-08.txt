8th (Lord’s day). Up, and was in great trouble how to get a passage to
White Hall, it raining, and no coach to be had. So I walked to the Old
Swan, and there got a scull. To the Duke of Yorke, where we all met
to hear the debate between Sir Thomas Allen and Mr. Wayth; the former
complaining of the latter’s ill usage of him at the late pay of his
ship. But a very sorry poor occasion he had for it. The Duke did
determine it with great judgement, chiding both, but encouraging Wayth
to continue to be a check to all captains in any thing to the King’s
right. And, indeed, I never did see the Duke do any thing more in order,
nor with more judgement than he did pass the verdict in this business.
The Court full this morning of the newes of Tom Cheffin’s death, the
King’s closett-keeper. He was well last night as ever, flaying at tables
in the house, and not very ill this morning at six o’clock, yet dead
before seven: they think, of an imposthume in his breast. But it looks
fearfully among people nowadays, the plague, as we hear, encreasing
every where again. To the Chappell, but could not get in to hear well.
But I had the pleasure once in my life to see an Archbishop (this was
of Yorke) in a pulpit. Then at a loss how to get home to dinner, having
promised to carry Mrs. Hunt thither. At last got my Lord Hinchingbroke’s
coach, he staying at Court; and so took her up in Axe-yard, and home and
dined. And good discourse of the old matters of the Protector and his
family, she having a relation to them. The Protector

     [Richard Cromwell subsequently returned to England, and resided in
     strict privacy at Cheshunt for some years before his death in 1712]

lives in France: spends about L500 per annum. Thence carried her
home again and then to Court and walked over to St. James’s Chappell,
thinking to have heard a Jesuite preach, but come too late. So got a
hackney and home, and there to business. At night had Mercer comb my
head and so to supper, sing a psalm, and to bed.
