19th. Up, and betimes to the Old Swan, and by water to White Hall, and
thence to W. Coventry’s, where stayed but a little to talk with him,
and thence by water back again, it being a mighty fine, clear spring
morning. Back to the Old Swan, and drank at Michell’s, whose house goes
up apace, but I could not see Betty, and thence walked all along
Thames Street, which I have not done since it was burned, as far as
Billingsgate; and there do see a brave street likely to be, many brave
houses being built, and of them a great many by Mr. Jaggard; but the
raising of the street will make it mighty fine. So to the office, where
busy all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and thence to the office,
very busy till five o’clock, and then to ease my eyes I took my wife out
and Deb. to the ‘Change, and there bought them some things, and so home
again and to the office, ended my letters, and so home to read a little
more in last night’s book, with much sport, it being a foolish book, and
so to supper and to bed. This afternoon I was surprized with a letter
without a name to it, very well writ, in a good stile, giving me notice
of my cozen Kate Joyce’s being likely to ruin herself by marriage, and
by ill reports already abroad of her, and I do fear that this keeping
of an inne may spoil her, being a young and pretty comely woman, and
thought to be left well. I did answer the letter with thanks and good
liking, and am resolved to take the advice he gives me, and go see her,
and find out what I can: but if she will ruin herself, I cannot help it,
though I should be troubled for it.
