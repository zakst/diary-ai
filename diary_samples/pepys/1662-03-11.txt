11th. At the office all the morning, and all the afternoon rummaging of
papers in my chamber, and tearing some and sorting others till late
at night, and so to bed, my wife being not well all this day. This
afternoon Mrs. Turner and The. came to see me, her mother not having
been abroad many a day before, but now is pretty well again and has made
me one of the first visits.
