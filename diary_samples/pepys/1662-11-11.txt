11th. All the morning sitting at the office, and then to dinner with my
wife, and so to the office again (where a good while Mr. Bland was with
me, telling me very fine things in merchandize, which, but that the
trouble of my office do so cruelly hinder me, I would take some pains
in) till late at night. Towards the evening I, as I have done for three
or four nights, studying something of Arithmetique, which do please me
well to see myself come forward. So home, to supper, and to bed.
