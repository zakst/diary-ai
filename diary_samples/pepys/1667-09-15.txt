15th. Up, and to the office, where, Sir W. Pen being ill of the gout, we
all of us met there in his parlour and did the business of the office,
our greatest business now being to manage the pay of the ships in
order and with speed to satisfy the Commissioners of the Treasury. This
morning my brother set out for Brampton again, and is gone. At noon home
to dinner, and thence my wife and I and Willet to the Duke of York’s
house, where, after long stay, the King and Duke of York come, and there
saw “The Coffee-house,” the most ridiculous, insipid play that ever I
saw in my life, and glad we were that Betterton had no part in it. But
here, before the play begun, my wife begun to complain to me of Willet’s
confidence in sitting cheek by jowl by us, which was a poor thing; but
I perceive she is already jealous of my kindness to her, so that I begin
to fear this girle is not likely to stay long with us. The play done,
we home by coach, it being moonlight, and got well home, and I to my
chamber to settle some papers, and so to supper and to bed.
