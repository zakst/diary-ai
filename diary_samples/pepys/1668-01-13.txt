13th. Up, and Mr. Gibbs comes to me, and I give him instructions about
the writing fair my Tangier accounts against to-morrow. So I abroad with
Sir W. Pen to White Hall, and there did with the rest attend the Duke of
York, where nothing extraordinary; only I perceive there is nothing
yet declared for the next, year, what fleete shall be abroad. Thence
homeward by coach and stopped at Martin’s, my bookseller, where I saw
the French book which I did think to have had for my wife to translate,
called “L’escholle des filles,”

     [“L’Escole des Filles,” by Helot, was burnt at the foot of the
     gallows in 1672, and the author himself was burnt in effigy.]

but when I come to look in it, it is the most bawdy, lewd book that
ever I saw, rather worse than “Putana errante,” so that I was ashamed of
reading in it, and so away home, and there to the ‘Change to discourse
with Sir H. Cholmly, and so home to dinner, and in the evening, having
done some business, I with my wife and girl out, and left them at
Unthanke’s, while I to White Hall to the Treasury Chamber for an order
for Tangier, and so back, took up my wife, and home, and there busy
about my Tangier accounts against tomorrow, which I do get ready in good
condition, and so with great content to bed.
