25th. Up and to my office, where with Captain Cocke making an end of his
last night’s accounts till noon, and so home to dinner, my wife being
come in from laying out about L4 in provision of several things against
Lent. In the afternoon to the Temple, my brother’s, the Wardrobe, to
Mr. Moore, and other places, called at about small businesses, and so
at night home to my office and then to supper and to bed. The Commons in
Parliament, I hear, are very high to stand to the Act of Uniformity, and
will not indulge the Papists (which is endeavoured by the Court Party)
nor the Presbyters.
