24th. Up, and at the Office all the morning, and at noon home to dinner,
where Mr. Gentleman, the cook, and an old woman, his third or fourth
wife, come and dined with us, to enquire about a ticket of his son’s,
that is dead; and after dinner, I with Mr. Hosier to my closet, to
discourse of the business of balancing Storekeeper’s accounts, which
he hath taken great pains in reducing to a method, to my great
satisfaction; and I shall be glad both for the King’s sake and his, that
the thing may be put in practice, and will do my part to promote it.
That done, he gone, I to the Office, where busy till night; and then
with comfort to sit with my wife, and get her to read to me, and so to
supper, and to bed, with my mind at mighty ease.
