10th. In the morning most of my disease, that is, itching and pimples,
were gone. In the morning visited by Mr. Coventry and others, and very
glad I am to see that I am so much inquired after and my sickness taken
notice of as I did. I keep my bed all day and sweat again at night, by
which I expect to be very well to-morrow. This evening Sir W. Warren
came himself to the door and left a letter and box for me, and went his
way. His letter mentions his giving me and my wife a pair of gloves;
but, opening the box, we found a pair of plain white gloves for my hand,
and a fair state dish of silver, and cup, with my arms, ready cut upon
them, worth, I believe, about L18, which is a very noble present, and
the best I ever had yet. So after some contentful talk with my wife, she
to bed and I to rest.
