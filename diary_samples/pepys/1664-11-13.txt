13th, 1664, we read, “Rear Admiral Teddeman with four or five ships
     has gone to course in the Channel, and if he meet any refractory
     Dutchmen will teach them their duty” (“Calendar of State Papers,”
      Domestic, 1664.-65, p. 66).]

And I had letters this afternoon, that three are brought into the Downes
and Dover; so that the warr is begun: God give a good end to it! After
dinner at home all the afternoon busy, and at night with Sir W. Batten
and Sir J. Minnes looking over the business of stating the accounts of
the navy charge to my Lord Treasurer, where Sir J. Minnes’s paper served
us in no stead almost, but was all false, and after I had done it with
great pains, he being by, I am confident he understands not one word
in it. At it till 10 at night almost. Thence by coach to Sir Philip
Warwicke’s, by his desire to have conferred with him, but he being
in bed, I to White Hall to the Secretaries, and there wrote to Mr.
Coventry, and so home by coach again, a fine clear moonshine night, but
very cold. Home to my office awhile, it being past 12 at night; and so
to supper and to bed.
