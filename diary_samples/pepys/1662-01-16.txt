16th. Towards Cheapside; and in Paul’s Churchyard saw the funeral of
my Lord Cornwallis, late Steward of the King’s House, a bold profane
talking man, go by, and thence I to the Paynter’s, and there paid him L6
for the two pictures, and 36s. for the two frames. From thence home, and
Mr. Holliard and my brother Tom dined with me, and he did give me good
advice about my health. In the afternoon at the office, and at night
to Sir W. Batten, and there saw him and Captain Cock and Stokes play
at cards, and afterwards supped with them. Stokes told us, that
notwithstanding the country of Gambo is so unhealthy, yet the people of
the place live very long, so as the present king there is 150 years old,
which they count by rains: because every year it rains continually four
months together. He also told us, that the kings there have above 100
wives a-piece, and offered him the choice of any of his wives to lie
with, and so he did Captain Holmes. So home and to bed.
