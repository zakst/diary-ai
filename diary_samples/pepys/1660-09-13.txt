13th. Early going to my Lord’s I met with Mr. Moore, who was going to my
house, and indeed I found him to be a most careful, painful,--[Painful,
i.e. painstaking or laborious. Latimer speaks of the “painful
magistrates.”]--and able man in business, and took him by water to the
Wardrobe, and shewed him all the house; and indeed there is a great deal
of room in it, but very ugly till my Lord hath bestowed great cost upon
it. So to the Exchequer, and there took Spicer and his fellow clerks
to the Dog tavern, and did give them a peck of oysters, and so home to
dinner, where I found my wife making of pies and tarts to try, her oven
with, which she has never yet done, but not knowing the nature of it,
did heat it too hot, and so a little overbake her things, but knows how
to do better another time. At home all the afternoon. At night made up
my accounts of my sea expenses in order to my clearing off my imprest
bill of L30 which I had in my hands at the beginning of my voyage; which
I intend to shew to my Lord to-morrow. To bed.
