10th. So up, and to the office, where all the morning. At noon home to
dinner and there busy all the afternoon till past six oâ€™clock, and then
abroad with my wife by coach, who is now at great ease, her cheeke being
broke inward. We took with us Mrs. Turner, who was come to visit my wife
just as we were going out. A great deale of tittle tattle discourse to
little purpose, I finding her, though in other things a very discreete
woman, as very a gossip speaking of her neighbours as any body. Going
out towards Hackney by coach for the ayre, the silly coachman carries
us to Shoreditch, which was so pleasant a piece of simplicity in him and
us, that made us mighty merry. So back again late, it being wondrous hot
all the day and night and it lightning exceeding all the way we went and
came, but without thunder. Coming home we called at a little ale-house,
and had an eele pye, of which my wife eat part and brought home the
rest. So being come home we to supper and to bed. This day come our new
cook maid Mary, commended by Mrs. Batters.
