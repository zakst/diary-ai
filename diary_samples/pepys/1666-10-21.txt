21st the spaniel “was produced and found very well” (Birch’s
     “History of the Royal Society,” vol.  ii., pp.  123, 125).  The
     experiment of transfusion of blood, which occupied much of the
     attention of the Royal Society in its early days, was revived within
     the last few years.]

The first died upon the place, and the other very well, and likely to do
well. This did give occasion to many pretty wishes, as of the blood of
a Quaker to be let into an Archbishop, and such like; but, as Dr.
Croone says, may, if it takes, be of mighty use to man’s health, for
the amending of bad blood by borrowing from a better body. After supper,
James Houblon and another brother took me aside and to talk of some
businesses of their owne, where I am to serve them, and will, and then
to talk of publique matters, and I do find that they and all merchants
else do give over trade and the nation for lost, nothing being done
with care or foresight, no convoys granted, nor any thing done to
satisfaction; but do think that the Dutch and French will master us the
next yeare, do what we can: and so do I, unless necessity makes the King
to mind his business, which might yet save all. Here we sat talking till
past one in the morning, and then home, where my people sat up for me,
my wife and all, and so to bed.
