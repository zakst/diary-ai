25th (Lady day). Up betimes and to my office, where all the morning.
At noon dined alone with Sir W. Batten, where great discourse of Sir
W. Pen, Sir W. Batten being, I perceive, quite out of love with him,
thinking him too great and too high, and began to talk that the world
do question his courage, upon which I told him plainly I have been told
that he was articled against for it, and that Sir H. Vane was his great
friend therein. This he was, I perceive, glad to hear. Thence to the
office, and there very late, very busy, to my great content. This
afternoon of a sudden is come home Sir W. Pen from the fleete, but upon
what score I know not. Late home to supper and to bed.
