13th. To the Privy Seal in the morning, then to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill. So my Lady
intends to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my
house, for fear of the small-pox. After dinner I went to my father’s,
where I found him within, and went up to him, and there found him
settling his papers against his removal, and I took some old papers of
difference between me and my wife and took them away. After that Pall
being there I spoke to my father about my intention not to keep her
longer for such and such reasons, which troubled him and me also, and
had like to have come to some high words between my mother and me, who
is become a very simple woman. By and by comes in Mrs. Cordery to
take her leave of my father, thinking he was to go presently into the
country, and will have us to come and see her before he do go. Then my
father and I went forth to Mr. Rawlinson’s, where afterwards comes my
uncle Thomas and his two sons, and then my uncle Wight by appointment
of us all, and there we read the will and told them how things are,
and what our thoughts are of kindness to my uncle Thomas if he do carry
himself peaceable, but otherwise if he persist to keep his caveat up
against us. So he promised to withdraw it, and seemed to be very well
contented with things as they are. After a while drinking, we paid all
and parted, and so I home, and there found my Lady’s three sons come, of
which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any service
in this kind, but my mind is yet very much troubled about my Lord of
Sandwich’s health, which I am afeard of.
