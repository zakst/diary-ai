14th. The arms being come this morning from the Tower, we caused them
to be distributed. I spent much time walking with Lieutenant Lambert,
walking up and down the yards, who did give me much light into things
there, and so went along with me and dined with us. After dinner Mrs.
Pett, her husband being gone this morning with Sir W. Batten to Chatham,
lent us her coach, and carried us to Woolwich, where we did also
dispose of the arms there and settle the guards. So to Mr. Pett’s, the
shipwright, and there supped, where he did treat us very handsomely (and
strange it is to see what neat houses all the officers of the King’s
yards have), his wife a proper woman, and has been handsome, and yet has
a very pretty hand. Thence I with Mr. Ackworth to his house, where he
has a very pretty house, and a very proper lovely woman to his wife,
who both sat with me in my chamber, and they being gone, I went to bed,
which was also most neat and fine.
