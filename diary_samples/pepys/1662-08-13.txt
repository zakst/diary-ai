13th. Up early, and to my office, where people come to me about
business, and by and by we met on purpose to enquire into the business
of the flag-makers, where I am the person that do chiefly manage the
business against them on the King’s part; and I do find it the greatest
cheat that I have yet found; they having eightpence per yard allowed
them by pretence of a contract, where no such thing appears; and it is
threepence more than was formerly paid, and than I now offer the Board
to have them done. We did not fully end it, but refer it to another
time. At noon Commr. Pett and I by water to Greenwich, and on board the
pleasure-boats to see what they wanted, they being ordered to sea, and
very pretty things I still find them, and so on shore and at the Shipp
had a bit of meat and dined, there waiting upon us a barber of Mr.
Pett’s acquaintance that plays very well upon the viollin. Thence to
Lambeth; and there saw the little pleasure-boat in building by the
King, my Lord Brunkard, and the virtuosoes of the town, according to new
lines, which Mr. Pett cries up mightily, but how it will prove we shall
soon see. So by water home, and busy at my study late, drawing a letter
to the yards of reprehension and direction for the board to sign, in
which I took great pains. So home and to bed.
