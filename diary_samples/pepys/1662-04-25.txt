25th. Up betimes and to my workmen, and then to the office, where we
sat all the morning. So home to dinner alone and then to my workmen
till night, and so to my office till bedtime, and so after supper to my
lodgings and to bed. This evening I sat awhile at Sir W. Batten’s with
Sir J. Minnes, &c., where he told us among many other things how in
Portugal they scorn to make a seat for a house of office, but they do
.... all in pots and so empty them in the river. I did also hear how
the woman, formerly nurse to Mrs. Lemon (Sir W. Batten’s daughter), her
child was torn to pieces by two doggs at Walthamstow this week, and is
dead, which is very strange.
