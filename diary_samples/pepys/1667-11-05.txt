5th. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon home to dinner, and
thence out with my wife and girle, and left them at her tailorâ€™s, and
I to the Treasury, and there did a little business for Tangier, and so
took them up again, and home, and when I had done at the office, being
post night, I to my chamber, and there did something more, and so to
supper and to bed.
