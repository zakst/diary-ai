29th. All the morning busy at the office. In the afternoon to my Lord
Treasurerâ€™s, and there got my Lord Treasurer to sign the warrant for my
striking of tallys, and so doing many jobbs in my way home, and there
late writeing letters, being troubled in my mind to hear that Sir W.
Batten and Sir J. Minnes do take notice that I am now-a-days much from
the office upon no office business, which vexes me, and will make me
mind my business the better, I hope in God; but what troubles me more
is, that I do omit to write, as I should do, to Mr. Coventry, which I
must not do, though this night I minded it so little as to sleep in the
middle of my letter to him, and committed forty blotts and blurrs in my
letter to him, but of this I hope never more to be guilty, if I have not
already given him sufficient offence. So, late home, and to bed.
