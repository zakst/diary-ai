21st. And so lay long in the morning, till I heard people knock at my
door, and I took it to be about 8 o’clock (but afterwards found myself
a little mistaken), and so I rose and ranted at Will and the maid, and
swore I could find my heart to kick them down stairs, which the maid
mumbled at mightily. It was my brother, who staid and talked with me,
his chief business being about his going about to build his house new at
the top, which will be a great charge for him, and above his judgment.
By and by comes Mr. Deane, of Woolwich, with his draught of a ship, and
the bend and main lines in the body of a ship very finely, and which do
please me mightily, and so am resolved to study hard, and learn of him
to understand a body, and I find him a very pretty fellow in it, and
rational, but a little conceited, but that’s no matter to me. At noon,
by my Lady Batten’s desire, I went over the water to Mr. Castle’s, who
brings his wife home to his own house to-day, where I found a great many
good old women, and my Lady, Sir W. Batten, and Sir J. Minnes. A good,
handsome, plain dinner, and then walked in the garden; which is pleasant
enough, more than I expected there, and so Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten,
and I by water to the office, and there sat, and then I by water to the
Temple about my law business, and back again home and wrote letters to
my father and wife about my desire that they should observe the feast
at Brampton, and have my Lady and the family, and so home to supper
and bed, my head aching all the day from my last night’s bad rest, and
yesterday’s distempering myself with over walking, and to-day knocking
my head against a low door in Mr. Castle’s house. This day the
Parliament kept a fast for the present unseasonable weather.
