29th (Lord’s day). To church in the morning, and so to dinner, and Sir
W. Pen and daughter, and Mrs. Poole, his kinswoman, Captain Poole’s
wife, came by appointment to dinner with us, and a good dinner we had
for them, and were very merry, and so to church again, and then to Sir
W. Pen’s and there supped, where his brother, a traveller, and one that
speaks Spanish very well, and a merry man, supped with us, and what
at dinner and supper I drink I know not how, of my own accord, so much
wine, that I was even almost foxed, and my head aked all night; so home
and to bed, without prayers, which I never did yet, since I came to the
house, of a Sunday night: I being now so out of order that I durst not
read prayers, for fear of being perceived by my servants in what case I
was. So to bed.
