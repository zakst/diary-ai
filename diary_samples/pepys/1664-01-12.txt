12th. Up and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and at noon
to the â€˜Change awhile, and so home, getting things against dinner ready,
and anon comes my uncle Wight and my aunt, with their cozens Mary and
Robert, and by chance my uncle Thomas Pepys. We had a good dinner, the
chief dish a swan roasted, and that excellent meate. At, dinner and all
day very merry. After dinner to cards, where till evening, then to the
office a little, and to cards again with them, and lost half-a-crowne.
They being gone, my wife did tell me how my uncle did this day accost
her alone, and spoke of his hoping she was with child, and kissing
her earnestly told her he should be very glad of it, and from all
circumstances methinks he do seem to have some intention of good to us,
which I shall endeavour to continue more than ever I did yet. So to my
office till late, and then home to bed, after being at prayers, which is
the first time after my late vowe to say prayers in my family twice in
every week.
