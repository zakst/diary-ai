26th. Up, and we met all this morning at Sir W. Pen’s roome, the office
being fowle with the altering of our garden door. There very busy,
and at noon home, where Mrs. Pierce and her daughter’s husband and Mr.
Corbet dined with me. I had a good dinner for them, and mighty merry.
Pierce and I very glad at the fate of the officers of Ordnance, that
they are like to have so much blame on them. Here Mrs. Pierce tells me
that the two Marshalls at the King’s house are Stephen Marshall’s,
the great Presbyterian’s daughters: and that Nelly and Beck Marshall,
falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord
Buckhurst’s whore. Nell answered then, “I was but one man’s whore,
though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the
guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter’s
praying daughter!” which was very pretty. Mrs. Pierce is still very
pretty, but paints red on her face, which makes me hate her, that I
thank God I take no pleasure in her at all more. After much mirth and
good company at dinner, I to the office and left them, and Pendleton
also, who come in to see my wife and talk of dancing, and there I at the
office all the afternoon very busy, and did much business, with my great
content to see it go off of hand, and so home, my eyes spent, to supper
and to bed.
