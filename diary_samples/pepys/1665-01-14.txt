14th. Up and to White Hall, where long waited in the Duke’s chamber for
a Committee intended for Tangier, but none met, and so I home and to the
office, where we met a little, and then to the ‘Change, where our late
ill newes confirmed in loss of two ships in the Straights, but are now
the Phoenix and Nonsuch! Home to dinner, thence with my wife to the
King’s house, there to see “Vulpone,” a most excellent play; the best I
think I ever saw, and well, acted. So with Sir W. Pen home in his coach,
and then to the office. So home, to supper, and bed, resolving by the
grace of God from this day to fall hard to my business again, after some
weeke or fortnight’s neglect.
