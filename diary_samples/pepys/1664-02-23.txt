23rd. Up, it being Shrove Tuesday, and at the office sat all the
morning, at noon to the ‘Change and there met with Sir W. Rider, and of
a sudden knowing what I had at home, brought him and Mr. Cutler and Mr.
Cooke, clerk to Mr. Secretary Morrice, a sober and pleasant man, and one
that I knew heretofore, when he was my Lord ‘s secretary at Dunkirke. I
made much of them and had a pretty dinner for a sudden. We talked very
pleasantly, and they many good discourses of their travels abroad. After
dinner they gone, I to my office, where doing many businesses very late,
but to my good content to see how I grow in estimation every day
more and more, and have things given more oftener than I used to have
formerly, as to have a case of very pretty knives with agate shafts by
Mrs. Russell. So home and to bed. This day, by the blessing of God, I
have lived thirty-one years in the world; and, by the grace of God, I
find myself not only in good health in every thing, and particularly as
to the stone, but only pain upon taking cold, and also in a fair way of
coming to a better esteem and estate in the world, than ever I expected.
But I pray God give me a heart to fear a fall, and to prepare for it!
