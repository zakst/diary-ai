28th. Up, called up by drums and trumpets; these things and boxes [??]
having cost me much money this Christmas already, and will do more.
My wife down by water to see her mother, and I with W. Hewer all
day together in my closet making some advance in the settling of my
accounts, which have been so long unevened that it troubles me how to
set them right, having not the use of my eyes to help me. My wife
at night home, and tells me how much her mother prays for me and is
troubled for my eyes; and I am glad to have friendship with them, and
believe they are truly glad to see their daughter come to live so well
as she do. So spent the night in talking, and so to supper and to bed.
