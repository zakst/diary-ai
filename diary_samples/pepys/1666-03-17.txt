17th. Up, and several people to speak with me, and then comes Mr.
Caesar, and then Goodgroome, and, what with one and the other, nothing
but musique with me this morning, to my great content; and the more, to
see that God Aimighty hath put me into condition to bear the charge of
all this. So out to the ‘Change, and did a little business, and then
home, where they two musicians and Mr. Cooke come to see me, and Mercer
to go along with my wife this afternoon to a play. To dinner, and then
our company all broke up, and to my chamber to do several things. Among
other things, to write a letter to my Lord Sandwich, it being one of
the burdens upon my mind that I have not writ to him since he went into
Spain, but now I do intend to give him a brief account of our whole
year’s actions since he went, which will make amends. My wife well home
in the evening from the play; which I was glad of, it being cold and
dark, and she having her necklace of pearl on, and none but Mercer with
her. Spent the evening in fitting my books, to have the number set upon
each, in order to my having an alphabet of my whole, which will be of
great ease to me. This day Captain Batters come from sea in his fireship
and come to see me, poor man, as his patron, and a poor painful wretch
he is as can be. After supper to bed.
