8th. Up, and by water to White Hall, and to St. James’s, there to talk
a little with Mr. Wren about the private business we are upon, in the
Office, where he tells me he finds that they all suspect me to be the
author of the great letter, which I value not, being satisfied that
it is the best thing I could ever do for myself; and so, after some
discourse of this kind more, I back to the Office, where all the
morning; and after dinner to it again, all the afternoon, and very late,
and then home to supper, where met W. Batelier and Betty Turner; and,
after some talk with them, and supper, we to bed. This day, I
received so earnest an invitation again from Roger Pepys, to come to
Sturbridge-Fair [at Cambridge] that I resolve to let my wife go, which
she shall do the next week, and so to bed. This day I received two
letters from the Duke of Richmond about his yacht, which is newly taken
into the King’s service, and I am glad of it, hoping hereby to oblige
him, and to have occasions of seeing his noble Duchess, which I admire.
