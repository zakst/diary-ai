3d. Waked in the morning by one who when I asked who it was, he told me
one from Bridewell, which proved Captain Holland. I rose presently to
him. He is come to get an order for the setting out of his ship, and to
renew his commission. He tells me how every man goes to the Lord Mayor
to set down their names, as such as do accept of his Majesty’s pardon,
and showed me a certificate under the Lord Mayor’s hand that he had done
so.

At sermon in the morning; after dinner into my cabin, to cast my
accounts up, and find myself to be worth near L100, for which I bless
Almighty God, it being more than I hoped for so soon, being I believe
not clearly worth L25 when I came to sea besides my house and goods.
Then to set my papers in order, they being increased much upon my hands
through want of time to put them in order. The ship’s company all this
while at sermon. After sermon my Lord did give me instruction to write
to London about business, which done, after supper to bed.
