14th. Up, and after a while at the office, I abroad in several places,
among others to my bookseller’s, and there spoke for several books
against New Year’s day, I resolving to lay out about L7 or L8, God
having given me some profit extraordinary of late; and bespoke also some
plate, spoons, and forks. I pray God keep me from too great expenses,
though these will still be pretty good money. Then to the ‘Change, and
I home to dinner, where Creed and Mr. Caesar, my boy’s lute master,
who plays indeed mighty finely, and after dinner I abroad, parting from
Creed, and away to and fro, laying out or preparing for laying out more
money, but I hope and resolve not to exceed therein, and to-night spoke
for some fruit for the country for my father against Christmas, and
where should I do it, but at the pretty woman’s, that used to stand at
the doore in Fanchurch Streete, I having a mind to know her. So home,
and late at my office, evening reckonings with Shergoll, hoping to get
money by the business, and so away home to supper and to bed, not being
very well through my taking cold of late, and so troubled with some
wind.
