11th. This morning, about two or three o’clock, knocked up in our back
yard, and rising to the window, being moonshine, I found it was the
constable and his watch, who had found our back yard door open, and so
came in to see what the matter was. So I desired them to shut the door,
and bid them good night, and so to bed again, and at 6 o’clock up and
a while to my vyall, and then to the office, where all the morning upon
the victualler’s accounts, and then with him to dinner at the Dolphin,
where I eat well but drank no wine neither; which keeps me in such good
order that I am mightily pleased with myself for it. Hither Mr. Moore
came to me, and he and I home and advised about business, and so after
an hour’s examining the state of the Navy debts lately cast up, I took
coach to Sir Philip Warwick’s, but finding Sir G. Carteret there I did
not go in, but directly home, again, it raining hard, having first of
all been with Creed and Mrs. Harper about a cook maid, and am like to
have one from Creed’s lodging. In my way home visited my Lord Crew and
Sir Thomas, thinking they might have enquired by the by of me touching
my Lord’s matters at Chelsey, but they said nothing, and so after some
slight common talk I bid them good night. At home to my office, and
after a while doing business home to supper and bed.
