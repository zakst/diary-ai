29th. Within all the morning. Several people to speak with me; Mr.
Shepley for L100; Mr. Kennard and Warren, the merchant, about deals for
my Lord. Captain Robert Blake lately come from the Straights about
some Florence Wine for my Lord, and with him I went to Sir W. Pen,
who offering me a barrel of oysters I took them both home to my house
(having by chance a good piece of roast beef at the fire for dinner),
and there they dined with me, and sat talking all the afternoon-good
company. Thence to Alderman Backwell’s and took a brave state-plate and
cupp in lieu of the candlesticks that I had the other day and carried
them by coach to my Lord’s and left them there. And so back to my
father’s and saw my mother, and so to my uncle Fenner’s, whither my
father came to me, and there we talked and drank, and so away; I home
with my father, he telling me what bad wives both my cozen Joyces
make to their husbands, which I much wondered at. After talking of my
sister’s coming to me next week, I went home and to bed.
