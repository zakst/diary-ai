16th. In the morning I was able to put on a wide shoe on the foot, and
to the office without much pain, and there sat all the morning. At noon
home to dinner, where Creed to discourse of our Tangier business, which
stands very bad in the business of money, and therefore we expect to
have a committee called soon, and to acquaint them among other things
with the order come to me for the not paying of any more pensions. We
dined together, and after dinner I to the office, and there very late,
very busy, doing much business indeed, and so with great comfort home to
supper, and so to bed to ease my foot, which toward night began to ake.
