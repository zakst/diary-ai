28th. Up and to my chamber to do some business there, and then to the
office, where a while, and then by agreement to the Excise Office, where
I waited all the morning for the Cofferer and Sir St. Foxeâ€™s coming,
but they did not, so I and the Commissioners lost their labour and
expectation of doing the business we intended. Thence home, where I find
Mr. Lovett and his wife came to see us. They are a pretty couple, and
she a fine bred woman. They dined with us, and Browne, the paynter, and
she plays finely on the lute. My wife and I were well pleased with her
company. After dinner broke up, I to the office and they abroad. All the
afternoon I busy at the office, and down by water to Deptford. Walked
back to Redriffe, and so home to the office again, being thoughtfull
how to answer Sir W. Coventry against to-morrow in the business of the
Victualling, but that I do trust to Tom Wilson, that he will be ready
with a book for me to-morrow morning. So to bed, my wife telling me
where she hath been to-day with my aunt Wight, and seen Mrs. Margaret
Wight, and says that she is one of the beautifullest women that ever she
saw in her life, the most excellent nose and mouth. They have been also
to see pretty Mrs. Batelier, and conclude her to be a prettier woman
than Mrs. Pierce, whom my wife led my aunt to see also this day.
