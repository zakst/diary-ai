Sept. 1st. A sad rainy night, up and to the office, where busy all
the morning. At noon to the â€˜Change and thence brought Mr. Pierce, the
Surgeon, and Creed, and dined very merry and handsomely; but my wife
not being well of those she not with us; and we cut up the great cake
Moorcocke lately sent us, which is very good. They gone I to my office,
and there very busy till late at night, and so home to supper and to
bed.
