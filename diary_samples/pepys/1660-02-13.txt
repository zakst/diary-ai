13th. To my office till noon, thence home to dinner, my mouth being
very bad of the cancer and my left leg beginning to be sore again. After
dinner to see Mrs. Jem, and in the way met with Catan on foot in the
street and talked with her a little, so home and took my wife to my
father’s. In my way I went to Playford’s, and for two books that I had
and 6s. 6d. to boot I had my great book of songs which he sells always
for r 4s. At my father’s I staid a while, while my mother sent her maid
Bess to Cheapside for some herbs to make a water for my mouth. Then I
went to see Mr. Cumberland, and after a little stay with him I returned,
and took my wife home, where after supper to bed. This day Monk was
invited to White Hall to dinner by my Lords; not seeming willing, he
would not come. I went to Mr. Fage from my father’s, who had been this
afternoon with Monk, who do promise to live and die with the City, and
for the honour of the City; and indeed the City is very open-handed to
the soldiers, that they are most of them drunk all day, and have money
given them. He did give me something for my mouth which I did use this
night.
