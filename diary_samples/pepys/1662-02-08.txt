8th. All the morning in the cellar with the colliers, removing the coles
out of the old cole hole into the new one, which cost me 8s. the doing;
but now the cellar is done and made clean, it do please me exceedingly,
as much as any thing that was ever yet done to my house. I pray God keep
me from setting my mind too much upon it. About 3 oâ€™clock the colliers
having done I went up to dinner (my wife having often urged me to come,
but my mind is so set upon these things that I cannot but be with the
workmen to see things done to my mind, which if I am not there is seldom
done), and so to the office, and thence to talk with Sir W. Pen,
walking in the dark in the garden some turns, he telling me of the ill
management of our office, and how Wood the timber merchant and others
were very knaves, which I am apt to believe. Home and wrote letters to
my father and my brother John, and so to bed. Being a little chillish,
intending to take physique to-morrow morning.
