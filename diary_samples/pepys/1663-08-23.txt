23rd (Lord’s day). Up and to church without my wife, she being all
dirty, as my house is. God forgive me, I looked about to see if I could
spy Pembleton, but I could not, which did please me not a little.
Home to dinner, and then to walk up and down in my house with my wife,
discoursing of our family matters, and I hope, after all my troubles of
mind and jealousy, we shall live happily still. To church again, and so
home to my wife; and with her read “Iter Boreale,” a poem, made just
at the King’s coming home; but I never read it before, and now like it
pretty well, but not so as it was cried up. So to supper. No pleasure or
discourse with Ashwell, with whom for her neglect and unconcernment to
do any thing in this time of dirt and trouble in the house, but gadding
abroad as she has been all this afternoon, I know not whither. After
supper to prayers and to bed, having been, by a sudden letter coming to
me from Mr. Coventry, been with Sir W. Pen, to discourse with him about
sending 500 soldiers into Ireland. I doubt matters do not go very right
there.
