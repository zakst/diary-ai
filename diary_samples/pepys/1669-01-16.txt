16th. Up, and to the office all the morning, dined at home with my
people, and so all the afternoon till night at the office busy, and
so home to supper and to bed. This morning Creed, and in the
afternoon comes Povy, to advise with me about my answer to the Lords
[Commissioners] of Tangier, about the propositions for the Treasurership
there, which I am not much concerned for. But the latter, talking of
publick things, told me, as Mr. Wren also did, that the Parliament is
likely to meets again, the King being frighted with what the Speaker
hath put him in mind of--his promise not to prorogue, but only to
adjourne them. They speak mighty freely of the folly of the King in this
foolish woman’s business, of my Lady Harvy. Povy tells me that Sir W.
Coventry was with the King alone, an hour this day; and that my Lady
Castlemayne is now in a higher command over the King than ever--not as a
mistress, for she scorns him, but as a tyrant, to command him: and says
that the Duchess of York and the Duke of York are mighty great with her,
which is a great interest to my Lord Chancellor’s’ family; and that
they do agree to hinder all they can the proceedings of the Duke of
Buckingham and Arlington: and so we are in the old mad condition, or
rather worse than any; no man knowing what the French intend to do the
next summer.
