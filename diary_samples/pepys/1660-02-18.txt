18th. A great while at my vial and voice, learning to sing “Fly boy, fly
boy,” without book. So to my office, where little to do. In the Hall I
met with Mr. Eglin and one Looker, a famous gardener, servant to my Lord
Salsbury, and among other things the gardener told a strange passage in
good earnest.... Home to dinner, and then went to my Lord’s lodgings to
my turret there and took away most of my books, and sent them home by
my maid. Thither came Capt. Holland to me who took me to the Half Moon
tavern and Mr. Southorne, Blackburne’s clerk. Thence he took me to the
Mitre in Fleet Street, where we heard (in a room over the music room)
very plainly through the ceiling. Here we parted and I to Mr. Wotton’s,
and with him to an alehouse and drank while he told me a great many
stories of comedies that he had formerly seen acted, and the names of
the principal actors, and gave me a very good account of it. Thence to
Whitehall, where I met with Luellin and in the clerk’s chamber wrote a
letter to my Lord. So home and to bed. This day two soldiers were hanged
in the Strand for their late mutiny at Somerset-house.
