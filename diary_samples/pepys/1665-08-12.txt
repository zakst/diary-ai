12th. The office now not sitting, but only hereafter on Thursdays at
the office, I within all the morning about my papers and setting things
still in order, and also much time in settling matters with Dr.
Twisden. At noon am sent for by Sir G. Carteret, to meet him and my Lord
Hinchingbroke at Deptford, but my Lord did not come thither, he having
crossed the river at Gravesend to Dagenhams, whither I dare not follow
him, they being afeard of me; but Sir G. Carteret says, he is a most
sweet youth in every circumstance. Sir G. Carteret being in haste of
going to the Duke of Albemarle and the Archbishop, he was pettish, and
so I could not fasten any discourse, but take another time. So he gone,
I down to Greenwich and sent away the Bezan, thinking to go with my wife
to-night to come back again to-morrow night to the Soveraigne at the
buoy off the Nore. Coming back to Deptford, old Bagwell walked a little
way with me, and would have me in to his daughter’s, and there he being
gone ‘dehors, ego had my volunte de su hiza’. Eat and drank and away
home, and after a little at the office to my chamber to put more things
still in order, and late to bed. The people die so, that now it seems
they are fain to carry the dead to be buried by day-light, the nights
not sufficing to do it in. And my Lord Mayor commands people to be
within at nine at night all, as they say, that the sick may have liberty
to go abroad for ayre. There is one also dead out of one of our ships
at Deptford, which troubles us mightily; the Providence fire-ship, which
was just fitted to go to sea. But they tell me to-day no more sick on
board. And this day W. Bodham tells me that one is dead at Woolwich,
not far from the Rope-yard. I am told, too, that a wife of one of the
groomes at Court is dead at Salsbury; so that the King and Queene are
speedily to be all gone to Milton. God preserve us!
