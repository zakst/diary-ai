8th. Up, and to my office, where all the morning busy. At noon dined
at home, and then to the office, where we sat all the afternoon. In the
evening comes my aunt and uncle Wight, Mrs. Norbury, and her daughter,
and after them Mr. Norbury, where no great pleasure, my aunt being out
of humour in her fine clothes, and it raining hard. Besides, I was a
little too bold with her about her doating on Dr. Venner. Anon they went
away, and I till past 12 at night at my office, and then home to bed.
