7th. Up and to my office, where busy all the morning, and at home to
dinner. It being Shrove Tuesday, had some very good fritters. All the
afternoon and evening at the office, and at night home to supper and to
bed. This day, Sir W. Batten, who hath been sicke four or five days, is
now very bad, so as people begin to fear his death; and I am at a loss
whether it will be better for me to have him die, because he is a bad
man, or live, for fear a worse should come.
