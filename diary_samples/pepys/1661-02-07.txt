7th’s time, he did give commission to his captains to make the King of
Denmark’s ships to strike to him in the Baltique. From thence Sir W. Pen
and I to the Theatre, but it was so full that we could hardly get any
room, so he went up to one of the boxes, and I into the 18d. places,
and there saw “Love at first sight,” a play of Mr. Killigrew’s, and the
first time that it hath been acted since before the troubles, and great
expectation there was, but I found the play to be a poor thing, and so I
perceive every body else do. So home, calling at Paul’s Churchyard for
a “Mare Clausum,” having it in my mind to write a little matter, what I
can gather, about the business of striking sayle, and present it to the
Duke, which I now think will be a good way to make myself known. So home
and to bed.
