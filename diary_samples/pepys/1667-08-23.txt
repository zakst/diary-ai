23rd. Up, and Greeting comes, who brings me a tune for two flageolets,
which we played, and is a tune played at the King’s playhouse, which
goes so well, that I will have more of them, and it will be a mighty
pleasure for me to have my wife able to play a part with me, which she
will easily, I find, do. Then abroad to White Hall in a hackney-coach
with Sir W. Pen: and in our way, in the narrow street near Paul’s, going
the backway by Tower Street, and the coach being forced to put back,
he was turning himself into a cellar,--[So much of London was yet in
ruins.--B]--which made people cry out to us, and so we were forced to
leap out--he out of one, and I out of the other boote;

     [The “boot” was originally a projection on each side of the coach,
     where the passengers sat with their backs to the carriage.  Such a
     “boot” is seen in the carriage containing the attendants of Queen
     Elizabeth, in Hoefnagel’s well-known picture of Nonsuch Palace,
     dated 1582.  Taylor, the Water Poet, the inveterate opponent of the
     introduction of coaches, thus satirizes the one in which he was
     forced to take his place as a passenger: “It wears two boots and no
     spurs, sometimes having two pairs of legs in one boot; and
     oftentimes against nature most preposterously it makes fair ladies
     wear the boot.  Moreover, it makes people imitate sea-crabs, in
     being drawn sideways, as they are when they sit in the boot of the
     coach.”  In course of time these projections were abolished, and the
     coach then consisted of three parts, viz., the body, the boot (on
     the top of which the coachman sat), and the baskets at the back.]

Query, whether a glass-coach would have permitted us to have made the
escape?--[See note on introduction of glass coaches, September 23rd,
