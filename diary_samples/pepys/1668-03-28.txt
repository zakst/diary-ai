28th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy, and at noon
home to dinner with my clerks; and though my head full of business, yet
I had a desire to end this holyday week with a play; and so, with my
wife and Deb., to the King’s house, and there saw “The Indian Emperour,”
 a very good play indeed, and thence directly home, and to my writing of
my letters, and so home to supper and to bed for fearing my eyes. Our
greatest business at the office to-day is our want of money for the
setting forth of these ships that are to go out, and my people at dinner
tell me that they do verily doubt that the want of men will be so great,
as we must press; and if we press, there will be mutinies in the town;
for the seamen are said already to have threatened the pulling down of
the Treasury Office; and if they do once come to that, it will not be
long before they come to ours.
