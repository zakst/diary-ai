30th (Office day). To the office, where Sir G. Carteret did give us an
account how Mr. Holland do intend to prevail with the Parliament to try
his project of discharging the seamen all at present by ticket, and so
promise interest to all men that will lend money upon them at eight per
cent., for so long as they are unpaid; whereby he do think to take away
the growing debt, which do now lie upon the kingdom for lack of present
money to discharge the seamen. But this we are, troubled at as some
diminution to us. I having two barrels of oysters at home, I caused one
of them and some wine to be brought to the inner room in the office, and
there the Principal Officers did go and eat them. So we sat till noon,
and then to dinner, and to it again in the afternoon till night. At
home I sent for Mr. Hater, and broke the other barrel with him, and did
afterwards sit down discoursing of sea terms to learn of him. And he
being gone I went up and sat till twelve at night again to make an end
of my Lordâ€™s accounts, as I did the last night. Which at last I made a
good end of, and so to bed.
