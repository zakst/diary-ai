19th. I did lie late a-bed. I and my wife by water, landed her at
Whitefriars with her boy with an iron of our new range which is already
broke and my wife will have changed, and many other things she has to
buy with the help of my father to-day. I to my Lord and found him in
bed. This day I received my commission to swear people the oath of
allegiance and supremacy delivered me by my Lord. After talk with my
Lord I went to Westminster Hall, where I took Mr. Michell and his wife,
and Mrs. Murford we sent for afterwards, to the Dog Tavern, where I did
give them a dish of anchovies and olives and paid for all, and did talk
of our old discourse when we did use to talk of the King, in the time of
the Rump, privately; after that to the Admiralty Office, in White Hall,
where I staid and writ my last observations for these four days
last past. Great talk of the difference between the Episcopal and
Presbyterian Clergy, but I believe it will come to nothing. So home and
to bed.
