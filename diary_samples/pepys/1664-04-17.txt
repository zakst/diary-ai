17th (Lord’s day). Up, and I put on my best cloth black suit and my
velvet cloake, and with my wife in her best laced suit to church, where
we have not been these nine or ten weeks. The truth is, my jealousy hath
hindered it, for fear she should see Pembleton. He was here to-day, but
I think sat so as he could not see her, which did please me, God help
me! mightily, though I know well enough that in reason this is nothing
but my ridiculous folly. Home to dinner, and in the afternoon, after
long consulting whether to go to Woolwich or no to see Mr. Falconer, but
indeed to prevent my wife going to church, I did however go to church
with her, where a young simple fellow did preach: I slept soundly all
the sermon, and thence to Sir W. Pen’s, my wife and I, there she talking
with him and his daughter, and thence with my wife walked to my uncle
Wight’s and there supped, where very merry, but I vexed to see what
charges the vanity of my aunt puts her husband to among her friends and
nothing at all among ours. Home and to bed. Our parson, Mr. Mills, his
owne mistake in reading of the service was very remarkable, that instead
of saying, “We beseech thee to preserve to our use the kindly fruits
of the earth,” he cries, “Preserve to our use our gracious Queen
Katherine.”
