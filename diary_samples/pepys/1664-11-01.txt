November 1st. Up and to the office, where busy all the morning, at noon
(my wife being invited to my Lady Sandwichâ€™s) all alone dined at home
upon a good goose with Mr. Wayth, discussing of business. Thence I
to the Committee of the Fishery, and there we sat with several good
discourses and some bad and simple ones, and with great disorder, and
yet by the men of businesse of the towne. But my report in the
business of the collections is mightily commended and will get me some
reputation, and indeed is the only thing looks like a thing well done
since we sat. Then with Mr. Parham to the tavern, but I drank no wine,
only he did give me another barrel of oysters, and he brought one Major
Greene, an able fishmonger, and good discourse to my information. So
home and late at business at my office. Then to supper and to bed.
