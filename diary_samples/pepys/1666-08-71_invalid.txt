a most scurvy letter, reflecting most upon Sir W. Coventry, and then
upon me for my accounts (not that they are not true, but that we do not
consider the expence of the fleete), and then of the whole office, in
neglecting them and the Kingâ€™s service, and this in very plain and sharp
and menacing terms. I did give a good account of matters according to
our computation of the expence of the fleete. I find Sir W. Coventry
willing enough to accept of any thing to confront the Generalls. But a
great supply must be made, and shall be in grace of God! But, however,
our accounts here will be found the true ones. Having done here, and
much work set me, I with greater content home than I thought I should
have done, and so to the office a while, and then home, and a while in
my new closet, which delights me every day more and more, and so late to
bed.
