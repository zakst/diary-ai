14s., the first thing like a bawble I have bought a good while, but I do
it with some trouble of mind, though my conscience tells me that I do
it with an apprehension of service in my office to have a book to write
memorandums in, and a pair of compasses in it; but I confess myself the
willinger to do it because I perceive by my accounts that I shall be
better by L30 than I expected to be. But by tomorrow night I intend to
see to the bottom of all my accounts. Then home to dinner, where Mr.
Moore met me. Then he went away, and I to the office and dispatch much
business. So in the evening, my wife and I and Jane over the water to
the Halfway-house, a pretty, pleasant walk, but the wind high. So home
again and to bed.
