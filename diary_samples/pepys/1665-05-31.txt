31st. Up, and to my office, and to Westminster, doing business till
noon, and then to the ‘Change, where great the noise and trouble of
having our Hambrough ships lost; and that very much placed upon Mr.
Coventry’s forgetting to give notice to them of the going away of our
fleete from the coast of Holland. But all without reason, for he did;
but the merchants not being ready, staid longer than the time ordered
for the convoy to stay, which was ten days. Thence home with Creed and
Mr. Moore to dinner. Anon we broke up, and Creed and I to discourse
about our Tangier matters of money, which vex me. So to Gresham College,
staid a very little while, and away and I home busy, and busy late, at
the end of the month, about my month’s accounts, but by the addition
of Tangier it is rendered more intricate, and so (which I have not done
these 12 months, nor would willingly have done now) failed of having it
done, but I will do it as soon as I can. So weary and sleepy to bed. I
endeavoured but missed of seeing Sir Thomas Ingram at Westminster, so
went to Houseman’s the Painter, who I intend shall draw my wife, but he
was not within, but I saw several very good pictures.
