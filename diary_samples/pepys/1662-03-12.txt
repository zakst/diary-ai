12th. At the office from morning till night putting of papers in order,
that so I may have my office in an orderly condition. I took much pains
in sorting and folding of papers. Dined at home, and there came Mrs.
Goldsborough about her old business, but I did give her a short answer
and sent away. This morning we had news from Mr. Coventry, that Sir
G. Downing (like a perfidious rogue, though the action is good and of
service to the King,

     [(“And hail the treason though we hate the traitor.”) On the 21st
     Charles returned his formal thanks to the States for their
     assistance in the matter.--B.]

yet he cannot with any good conscience do it) hath taken Okey,
Corbet, and Barkestead at Delfe, in Holland, and sent them home in the
Blackmore. Sir W. Pen, talking to me this afternoon of what a strange
thing it is for Downing to do this, he told me of a speech he made
to the Lords States of Holland, telling them to their faces that he
observed that he was not received with the respect and observance now,
that he was when he came from the traitor and rebell Cromwell: by whom,
I am sure, he hath got all he hath in the world,--and they know it too.

     [Charles, when residing at Brussels, went to the Hague at night to
     pay a secret visit to his sister, the Princess of Orange.  After his
     arrival, “an old reverend-like man, with a long grey beard and
     ordinary grey clothes,” entered the inn and begged for a private
     interview.  He then fell on his knees, and pulling off his disguise,
     discovered himself to be Mr. Downing, then ambassador from Cromwell
     to the States-General.  He informed Charles that the Dutch had
     guaranteed to the English Commonwealth to deliver him into their
     hands should he ever set foot in their territory.  This warning
     probably saved Charles’s liberty.--M. B.]
