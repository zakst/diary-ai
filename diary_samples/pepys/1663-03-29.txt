29th (Lord’s day). Waked as I used to do betimes, but being Sunday and
very cold I lay long, it raining and snowing very hard, which I did
never think it would have done any more this year. Up and to church,
home to dinner. After dinner in comes Mr. Moore, and sat and talked with
us a good while; among other things telling me, that [neither] my Lord
nor he are under apprehensions of the late discourse in the House of
Commons, concerning resumption of Crowne lands, which I am very glad of.
He being gone, up to my chamber, where my wife and Ashwell and I all the
afternoon talking and laughing, and by and by I a while to my office,
reading over some papers which I found in my man William’s chest of
drawers, among others some old precedents concerning the practice of
this office heretofore, which I am glad to find and shall make use of,
among others an oath, which the Principal Officers were bound to swear
at their entrance into their offices, which I would be glad were in use
still. So home and fell hard to make up my monthly accounts, letting my
family go to bed after prayers. I staid up long, and find myself, as
I think, fully worth L670. So with good comfort to bed, finding that
though it be but little, yet I do get ground every month. I pray God it
may continue so with me.
