30th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten to White Hall, and there we did attend
the Duke of York, and had much business with him; and pretty to see, it
being St. Andrew’s day, how some few did wear St. Andrew’s crosse; but
most did make a mockery at it, and the House of Parliament, contrary
to practice, did sit also: people having no mind to observe the Scotch
saints’ days till they hear better newes from Scotland. Thence to
Westminster Hall and the Abbey, thinking as I had appointed to have met
Mrs. Burroughs there, but not meeting her I home, and just overtook
my cozen Roger Pepys, Mrs. Turner, Dicke, and Joyce Norton, coming by
invitation to dine with me. These ladies I have not seen since before
the plague. Mrs. Turner is come to towne to look after her things in her
house, but all is lost. She is quite weary of the country, but cannot
get her husband to let her live here any more, which troubles her
mightily. She was mighty angry with me, that in all this time I never
writ to her, which I do think and take to myself as a fault, and which
I have promised to mend. Here I had a noble and costly dinner for them,
dressed by a man-cooke, as that the other day was, and pretty merry
we were, as I could be with this company and so great a charge. We sat
long, and after much talk of the plenty of her country in fish, but in
nothing also that is pleasing, we broke up with great kindness, and when
it begun to be dark we parted, they in one coach home, and I in another
to Westminster Hall, where by appointment Mrs. Burroughs and I were to
meet, but did not after I had spent the whole evening there. Only I did
go drink at the Swan, and there did meet with Sarah, who is now newly
married, and there I did lay the beginnings of a future ‘amour con
elle’..... Thence it being late away called at Mrs. Burroughs’ mother’s
door, and she come out to me, and I did hazer whatever I would.... and
then parted, and home, and after some playing at cards with my wife, we
to supper and to bed.
