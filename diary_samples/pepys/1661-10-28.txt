28th. At the office all the morning, and dined at home, and so to Paul’s
Churchyard to Hunt’s, and there found my Theorbo done, which pleases me
very well, and costs me 26s. to the altering. But now he tells me it
is as good a lute as any is in England, and is worth well L10. Hither I
sent for Captain Ferrers to me, who comes with a friend of his, and they
and I to the Theatre, and there saw “Argalus and Parthenia,” where
a woman acted Parthenia, and came afterwards on the stage in men’s
clothes, and had the best legs that ever I saw, and I was very well
pleased with it. Thence to the Ringo alehouse, and thither sent for a
belt-maker, and bought of him a handsome belt for second mourning, which
cost me 24s., and is very neat.
