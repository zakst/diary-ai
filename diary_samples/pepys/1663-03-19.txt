19th. Up betimes and to Woolwich all alone by water, where took the
officers most abed. I walked and enquired how all matters and businesses
go, and by and by to the Clerk of the Chequeâ€™s house, and there eat some
of his good Jamaica brawne, and so walked to Greenwich. Part of the way
Deane walking with me; talking of the pride and corruption of most of
his fellow officers of the yard, and which I believe to be true. So
to Deptford, where I did the same to great content, and see the people
begin to value me as they do the rest. At noon Mr. Wayth took me to his
house, where I dined, and saw his wife, a pretty woman, and had a good
fish dinner, and after dinner he and I walked to Redriffe talking of
several errors in the Navy, by which I learned a great deal, and was
glad of his company. So by water home, and by and by to the office,
where we sat till almost 9 at night. So after doing my own business in
my office, writing letters, &c., home to supper, and to bed, being weary
and vexed that I do not find other people so willing to do business as
myself, when I have taken pains to find out what in the yards is wanting
and fitting to be done.
