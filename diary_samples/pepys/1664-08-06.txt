6th. Here lay Deane Honiwood last night. I met and talked with him this
morning, and a simple priest he is, though a good, well-meaning man. W.
Joyce and I to a game at bowles on the green there till eight o’clock,
and then comes my wife in the coach, and a coach full of women, only one
man riding by, gone down last night to meet a sister of his coming to
town. So very joyful drank there, not ‘lighting, and we mounted and away
with them to Welling, and there ‘light, and dined very well and merry
and glad to see my poor-wife. Here very merry as being weary I could be,
and after dinner, out again, and to London. In our way all the way the
mightiest merry, at a couple of young gentlemen, come down to meet the
same gentlewoman, that ever I was in my life, and so W. Joyce too, to
see how one of them was horsed upon a hard-trotting sorrell horse, and
both of them soundly weary and galled. But it is not to be set down how
merry we were all the way. We ‘light in Holborne, and by another coach
my wife and mayde home, and I by horseback, and found all things well
and most mighty neate and clean. So, after welcoming my wife a little,
to the office, and so home to supper, and then weary and not very well
to bed.
