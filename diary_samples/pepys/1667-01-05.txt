5th. At the office all the morning, thinking at noon to have been taken
home, and my wife (according to appointment yesterday), by my Lord
Bruncker, to dinner and then to a play, but he had forgot it, at which I
was glad, being glad of avoyding the occasion of inviting him again,
and being forced to invite his doxy, Mrs. Williams. So home, and took a
small snap of victuals, and away, with my wife, to the Duke’s house, and
there saw “Mustapha,” a most excellent play for words and design as ever
I did see. I had seen it before but forgot it, so it was wholly new
to me, which is the pleasure of my not committing these things to my
memory. Home, and a little to the office, and then to bed, where I lay
with much pain in my head most of the night, and very unquiet, partly by
my drinking before I went out too great a draught of sack, and partly my
eyes being still very sore.
