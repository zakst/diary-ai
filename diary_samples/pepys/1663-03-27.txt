27th. Up betimes and at my office all the morning, at noon to the
Exchange, and there by appointment met my uncles Thomas and Wight, and
from thence with them to a tavern, and there paid my uncle Wight three
pieces of gold for himself, my aunt, and their son that is dead, left
by my uncle Robert, and read over our agreement with my uncle Thomas and
the state of our debts and legacies, and so good friendship I think is
made up between us all, only we have the worst of it in having so much
money to pay. Thence I to the Exchequer again, and thence with Creed
into Fleet Street, and calling at several places about business; in
passing, at the Hercules pillars he and I dined though late, and thence
with one that we found there, a friend of Captain Ferrers I used to
meet at the playhouse, they would have gone to some gameing house, but I
would not but parted, and staying a little in Paul’s Churchyard, at the
foreign Bookseller’s looking over some Spanish books, and with much ado
keeping myself from laying out money there, as also with them, being
willing enough to have gone to some idle house with them, I got home,
and after a while at my office, to supper, and to bed.
