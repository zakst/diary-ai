23rd. Up betimes and with my workmen, taking some pleasure to see my
work come towards an end, though I am vexed every day enough with their
delay. We met and sat all the morning, dined at home alone, and with
my workmen all the afternoon, and in the evening by water and land to
Deptford to give order for things about my house, and came back again
by coach with Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Batten (who has been at a Pay
to-day), and to my office and did some business, and so to supper and to
my lodgings, and so to bed. In our coming home Sir G. Carteret told me
how in most cabaretts in France they have writ upon the walls in fair
letters to be read, “Dieu te regarde,” as a good lesson to be in every
man’s mind, and have also, as in Holland, their poor’s box; in both
which places at the making all contracts and bargains they give so much,
which they call God’s penny.
