30th. Up, and the French periwigg maker of whom I bought two yesterday
comes with them, and I am very well pleased with them. So to the office,
where all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and thence with my
wife’s knowledge and leave did by coach go see the silly play of my Lady
Newcastle’s, called “The Humourous Lovers;” the most silly thing that
ever come upon a stage. I was sick to see it, but yet would not but have
seen it, that I might the better understand her. Here I spied Knipp and
Betty, of the King’s house, and sent Knipp oranges, but, having little
money about me, did not offer to carry them abroad, which otherwise I
had, I fear, been tempted to. So with [Sir] W. Pen home (he being at the
play also), a most summer evening, and to my office, where, among other
things, a most extraordinary letter to the Duke of York touching the
want of money and the sad state of the King’s service thereby, and so to
supper and to bed.
