19th. All the morning and afternoon at my office putting things in
order, and in the evening I do begin to digest my uncle the Captain’s
papers into one book, which I call my Brampton book, for the clearer
understanding things how they are with us. So home and supper and to
bed. This noon came a letter from T. Pepys, the turner, in answer to one
of mine the other day to him, wherein I did cheque him for not coming to
me, as he had promised, with his and his father’s resolucion about the
difference between us. But he writes to me in the very same slighting
terms that I did to him, without the least respect at all, but word for
word as I did him, which argues a high and noble spirit in him, though
it troubles me a little that he should make no more of my anger, yet I
cannot blame him for doing so, he being the elder brother’s son, and not
depending upon me at all.
