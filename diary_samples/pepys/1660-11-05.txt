5th (Office day). Being disappointed of money, we failed of going to
Deptford to pay off the Henrietta to-day. Dined at home, and at home all
day, and at the office at night, to make up an account of what the debts
of nineteen of the twenty-five ships that should have been paid off,
is increased since the adjournment of the Parliament, they being to sit
again to-morrow. This 5th of November is observed exceeding well in the
City; and at night great bonfires and fireworks. At night Mr. Moore came
and sat with me, and there I took a book and he did instruct me in many
law notions, in which I took great pleasure. To bed.
