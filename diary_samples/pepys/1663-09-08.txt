8, and lay talking till 9 with great pleasure with my wife. So up and
put my clothes in order against tomorrow’s journey, and then at noon
at dinner, and all the afternoon almost playing and discoursing with my
wife with great content, and then to my office there to put papers in
order against my going. And by and by comes my uncle Wight to bid us to
dinner to-morrow to a haunch of venison I sent them yesterday, given me
by Mr. Povy, but I cannot go, but my wife will. Then into the garden to
read my weekly vows, and then home, where at supper saying to my wife,
in ordinary fondness, “Well! shall you and I never travel together
again?” she took me up and offered and desired to go along with me. I
thinking by that means to have her safe from harm’s way at home here,
was willing enough to feign, and after some difficulties made did send
about for a horse and other things, and so I think she will go. So, in a
hurry getting myself and her things ready, to bed.
