31st (Sunday). At church, where a stranger preached like a fool. From
thence home and dined with my wife, she staying at home, being unwilling
to dress herself, the house being all dirty. To church again, and after
sermon I walked to my father’s, and to Mrs. Turner’s, where I could not
woo The. to give me a lesson upon the harpsicon and was angry at it. So
home and finding Will abroad at Sir W. Batten’s talking with the people
there (Sir W. and my Lady being in the country), I took occasion to be
angry with him, and so to prayers and to bed.
