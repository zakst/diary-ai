25th. To Whitehall, and so to dinner at the Wardrobe, where my wife met
me, and there we met with a venison pasty, and my Lady very merry and
very handsome, methought. After dinner my wife and I to the Opera, and
there saw again “Love and Honour,” a play so good that it has been acted
but three times and I have seen them all, and all in this week; which is
too much, and more than I will do again a good while. Coming out of the
house we met Mrs. Pierce and her comrade Mrs. Clifford, and I seeming
willing to stay with them to talk my wife grew angry, and whether she be
jealous or no I know, not, but she loves not that I should speak of
Mrs. Pierce. Home on foot very discontented, in my way I calling at the
Instrument maker, Hunt’s, and there saw my lute, which is now almost
done, it being to have a new neck to it and to be made to double
strings. So home and to bed. This day I did give my man Will a sound
lesson about his forbearing to give us the respect due to a master and
mistress.
