19th. Up, and to White Hall with Sir W. Batten (calling at my Lord
Ashly’s, but to no purpose, by the way, he being not up), and there had
our usual meeting before the Duke with the officers of the Ordnance
with us, which in some respects I think will be the better for us, for
despatch sake. Thence home to the ‘Change and dined alone (my wife gone
to her mother’s), after dinner to my little new goldsmith’s,

     [John Colvill of Lombard Street, see ante, May 24th.  He lost
     L85,832  17s. 2d.  by the closing of the Exchequer in 1672, and he
     died between 1672 and 1677 (Price’s “Handbook of London Bankers “).]

whose wife indeed is one of the prettiest, modest black women that ever
I saw. I paid for a dozen of silver salts L6 14s. 6d. Thence with Sir
W. Pen from the office down to Greenwich to see Sir J. Lawson, who is
better, but continues ill; his hickupp not being yet gone, could have
little discourse with him. So thence home and to supper, a while to the
office, my head and mind mightily vexed to see the multitude of papers
and business before [me] and so little time to do it in. So to bed.
