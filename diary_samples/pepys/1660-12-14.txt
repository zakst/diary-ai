14th. Also all this day looking upon my workmen. Only met with the
Comptroller at the office a little both forenoon and afternoon, and at
night step a little with him to the Coffee House where we light upon
very good company and had very good discourse concerning insects and
their having a generative faculty as well as other creatures. This
night in discourse the Comptroller told me among other persons that were
heretofore the principal officers of the Navy, there was one Sir Peter
Buck, a Clerk of the Acts, of which to myself I was not a little proud.
