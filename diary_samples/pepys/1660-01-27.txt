27th. With my Lord to the Duke, where he spoke to Mr. Coventry to
despatch my business of the Acts, in which place every body gives me
joy, as if I were in it, which God send.

     [The letters patent, dated July 13th, 12 Charles II., recite and
     revoke letters patent of February 16th, 14 Charles I., whereby the
     office of Clerk of the Ships had been given to Dennis Fleming and
     Thomas Barlow, or the survivor.  D. F. was then dead, but T. B.
     living, and Samuel Pepys was appointed in his room, at a salary of
     L33 6s. 8d. per annum, with 3s. 4d. for each day employed in
     travelling, and L6 per annum for boathire, and all fees due.  This
     salary was only the ancient “fee out of the Exchequer,” which had
     been attached to the office for more than a century.  Pepys’s salary
     had been previously fixed at L350 a year.]

Dined with my Lord and all the officers of his regiment, who invited my
Lord and his friends, as many as he would bring, to dinner, at the Swan,
at Dowgate, a poor house and ill dressed, but very good fish and plenty.
Here Mr. Symons, the Surgeon, told me how he was likely to lose his
estate that he had bought, at which I was not a little pleased. To
Westminster, and with Mr. Howe by coach to the Speaker’s, where my Lord
supped with the King, but I could not get in. So back again, and after
a song or two in my chamber in the dark, which do (now that the bed is
out) sound very well, I went home and to bed.
