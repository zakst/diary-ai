2d. change for each. He gone, I to the office, where business all
the afternoon, and at night comes Mr. Gawden at my desire to me, and
to-morrow I shall pay him some money, and shall see what present he will
make me, the hopes of which do make me to part with my money out of my
chest, which I should not otherwise do, but lest this alteration in
the Controller’s office should occasion my losing my concernment in the
Victualling, and so he have no more need of me. He gone, I to the office
again, having come thence home with him to talk, and so after a little
more business I to supper. I then sent for Mercer, and began to teach
her “It is decreed,” which will please me well, and so after supper
and reading a little, and my wife’s cutting off my hair short, which
is grown too long upon my crown of my head, I to bed. I met this day in
Westminster Hall Sir W. Batten and [Sir] W. Pen, and the latter since
our falling out the other day do look mighty reservedly upon me, and
still he shall do so for me, for I will be hanged before I seek to him,
unless I see I need it.
