21st. Up, and at the office all the morning, at noon dined at home, and
thence took Mrs. Turner out and carried her to the King’s house, and
saw “The Indian Emperour;” and after that done, took Knepp out, and to
Kensington; and there walked in the garden, and then supped, and
mighty merry, there being also in the house Sir Philip Howard, and some
company, and had a dear reckoning, but merry, and away, it being quite
night, home, and dark, about 9 o’clock or more, and in my coming had the
opportunity the first time in my life to be bold with Knepp..., and so
left her at home, and so Mrs. Turner and I home to my letters and to
bed. Here hear how Sir W. Pen’s impeachment was read, and agreed to, in
the House this day, and ordered to be engrossed; and he suspended the
House--[From sitting as a member pending the impeachment.-B.]--Harman
set at liberty; and Brouncker put out of the House, and a writ for a new
election, and an impeachment ordered to be brought in against him, he
being fled!

     [Sir Charles Berkeley, jun. was chosen in his room.  In the sea-
     fight off Southwold Bay on June 3rd, 1665, the English triumphed
     over the Dutch, but the very considerable victory was not followed
     up.  During the night, while the Duke of York slept, Henry
     Brouncker, his groom of the bedchamber, ordered the lieutenant to
     shorten sail, by which means the progress of the whole fleet was
     retarded, the Duke of York’s being the leading ship.  The duke
     affirmed that he first heard of Brouncker’s unjustifiable action in
     July, and yet he kept the culprit in his service for nearly two
     years after the offence had come to his knowledge.  After Brouncker
     had been dismissed from the duke’s service, the House of Commons
     ejected him.  The whole matter is one of the unsolved difficulties
     of history.  See Lister’s “Life of Clarendon,” ii., 334 335]
