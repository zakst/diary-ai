6th. Waked this morning with news, brought me by a messenger on purpose,
that my uncle Robert is dead, and died yesterday; so I rose sorry in
some respect, glad in my expectations in another respect. So I made
myself ready, went and told my uncle Wight, my Lady, and some others
thereof, and bought me a pair of boots in St. Martin’s, and got myself
ready, and then to the Post House and set out about eleven and twelve
o’clock, taking the messenger with me that came to me, and so we rode
and got well by nine o’clock to Brampton, where I found my father well.
My uncle’s corps in a coffin standing upon joynt-stools in the chimney
in the hall; but it begun to smell, and so I caused it to be set forth
in the yard all night, and watched by two men. My aunt I found in bed
in a most nasty ugly pickle, made me sick to see it. My father and I lay
together tonight, I greedy to see the will, but did not ask to see it
till to-morrow.
