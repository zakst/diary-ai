27th (Lordâ€™s day). At church in the morning; where in the pew both
Sir Williams and I had much talk about the death of Sir Robert, which
troubles me much; and them in appearance, though I do not believe it;
because I know that he was a cheque to their engrossing the whole trade
of the Navy office. Home to dinner, and in the afternoon to church
again, my wife with me, whose mourning is now grown so old that I am
ashamed to go to church with her. And after church to see my uncle and
aunt Wight, and there staid and talked and supped with them, and were
merry as we could be in their company. Among other things going up into
their chamber to see their two pictures, which I am forced to commend
against my judgment, and also she showed us her cabinet, where she had
very pretty medals and good jewels. So home and to prayers and to bed.
