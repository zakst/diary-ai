27th. Up and to church alone and so home to dinner with my wife very
pleasant and pleased with one another’s company, and in our general
enjoyment one of another, better we think than most other couples do. So
after dinner to the French church, but came too late, and so back to our
owne church, where I slept all the sermon the Scott preaching, and so
home, and in the evening Sir J. Minnes and I met at Sir W. Pen’s about
ordering some business of the Navy, and so I home to supper, discourse,
prayers, and bed.
