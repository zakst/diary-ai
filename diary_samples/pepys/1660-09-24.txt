24th. To my Lord’s, where after I had done talking with him Mr.
Townsend, Rumball, Blackburn, Creed and Shepley and I to the Rhenish
winehouse, and there I did give them two quarts of Wormwood wine,

     [Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) is celebrated for its intensely
     bitter, tonic, and stimulating qualities, which have caused it to be
     used in various medicinal preparations, and also in the making of
     liqueurs, as wormwood wine and creme d’absinthe.]

and so we broke up. So we parted, and I and Mr. Creed to Westminster
Hall and looked over a book or two, and so to my Lord’s, where I dined
with my lady, there being Mr. Child and Mrs. Borfett, who are never
absent at dinner there, under pretence of a wooing. From thence I to Mr.
de Cretz and did take away my Lord’s picture, which is now finished for
me, and I paid L3 10s. for it and the frame, and am well pleased with it
and the price. So carried it home by water, Will being with me. At home,
and had a fire made in my closet, and put my papers and books and things
in order, and that being done I fell to entering these two good songs of
Mr. Lawes, “Helpe, helpe, O helpe,” and “O God of Heaven and Hell” in my
song book, to which I have got Mr. Child to set the base to the Theorbo,
and that done to bed.
