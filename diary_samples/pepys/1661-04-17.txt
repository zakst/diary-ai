17th. By land and saw the arches, which are now almost done and are very
fine, and I saw the picture of the ships and other things this morning,
set up before the East Indy House, which are well done. So to the
office, and that being done I went to dinner with Sir W. Batten, and
then home to my workmen, and saw them go on with great content to me.
Then comes Mr. Allen of Chatham, and I took him to the Mitre and there
did drink with him, and did get of him the song that pleased me so well
there the other day, “Of Shitten come Shites the beginning of love.” His
daughters are to come to town to-morrow, but I know not whether I shall
see them or no. That done I went to the Dolphin by appointment and there
I met Sir Wms. both and Mr. Castle, and did eat a barrel of oysters and
two lobsters, which I did give them, and were very merry. Here we had
great talk of Mr. Warren’s being knighted by the King, and Sir W. B.
seemed to be very much incensed against him. So home.
