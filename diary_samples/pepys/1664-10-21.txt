21st. Up and by coach to Mr. Cole’s, and there conferred with him about
some law business, and so to Sir W. Turner’s, and there bought my cloth,
coloured, for a suit and cloake, to line with plush the cloak, which
will cost me money, but I find that I must go handsomely, whatever it
costs me, and the charge will be made up in the fruit it brings. Thence
to the Coffee-house and ‘Change, and so home to dinner, and then to the
office all the afternoon, whither comes W. Howe to see me, being come
from, and going presently back to sea with my Lord. Among other things
he tells me Mr. Creed is much out of favour with my Lord from his
freedom of talke and bold carriage, and other things with which my Lord
is not pleased, but most I doubt his not lending my Lord money, and Mr.
Moore’s reporting what his answer was I doubt in the worst manner. But,
however, a very unworthy rogue he is, and, therefore, let him go for one
good for nothing, though wise to the height above most men I converse
with. In the evening (W. Howe being gone) comes Mr. Martin, to trouble
me again to get him a Lieutenant’s place for which he is as fit as a
foole can be. But I put him off like an arse, as he is, and so setting
my papers and books in order: I home to supper and to bed.
