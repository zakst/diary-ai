29th. Up among my workmen with great pleasure. Then to the office, where
I found Sir W. Pen sent down yesterday to Chatham to get two great ships
in readiness presently to go to the East Indies upon some design against
the Dutch, we think, at Goa but it is a great secret yet. Dined at home,
came Mr. Shepley and Moore, and did business with both of them. After
that to Sir W. Battenâ€™s, where great store of company at dinner. Among
others my schoolfellow, Mr. Christmas, where very merry, and hither
came letters from above for the fitting of two other ships for the East
Indies in all haste, and so we got orders presently for the Hampshire
and Nonsuch. Then home and there put some papers in order, and not
knowing what to do, the house being so dirty, I went to bed.
