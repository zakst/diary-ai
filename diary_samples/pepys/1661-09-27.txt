27th. By coach to Whitehall with my wife (where she went to see Mrs.
Pierce, who was this day churched, her month of childbed being out). I
went to Mrs. Montagu and other businesses, and at noon met my wife at
the Wardrobe; and there dined, where we found Captain Country (my little
Captain that I loved, who carried me to the Sound), come with some
grapes and millons

     [The antiquity of the cultivation of the melon is very remote.  Both
     the melon (cucaimis melo) and the water-melon (cucumis citrullus)
     were introduced into England at the end of the sixteenth century.
     See vol. i., p. 228.]

from my Lord at Lisbon, the first that ever I saw any, and my wife and
I eat some, and took some home; but the grapes are rare things. Here we
staid; and in the afternoon comes Mr. Edwd. Montagu (by appointment
this morning) to talk with my Lady and me about the provisions fit to
be bought, and sent to my Lord along with him. And told us, that we need
not trouble ourselves how to buy them, for the King would pay for all,
and that he would take care to get them: which put my Lady and me into a
great deal of ease of mind. Here we staid and supped too, and, after
my wife had put up some of the grapes in a basket for to be sent to the
King, we took coach and home, where we found a hampire of millons sent
to me also.
