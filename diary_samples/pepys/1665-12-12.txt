12th. Up, and to the office, where my Lord Bruncker met, and among other
things did finish a contract with Cocke for hemp, by which I hope to
get my money due from him paid presently. At noon home to dinner, only
eating a bit, and with much kindness taking leave of Mr. Hill who goes
away to-day, and so I by water saving the tide through Bridge and to Sir
G. Downing by appointment at Charing Crosse, who did at first mightily
please me with informing me thoroughly the virtue and force of this Act,
and indeed it is ten times better than ever I thought could have been
said of it, but when he come to impose upon me that without more ado I
must get by my credit people to serve in goods and lend money upon it
and none could do it better than I, and the King should give me thanks
particularly in it, and I could not get him to excuse me, but I must
come to him though to no purpose on Saturday, and that he is sure I will
bring him some bargains or other made upon this Act, it vexed me more
than all the pleasure I took before, for I find he will be troublesome
to me in it, if I will let him have as much of my time as he would have.
So late I took leave and in the cold (the weather setting in cold) home
to the office and, after my letters being wrote, home to supper and to
bed, my wife being also gone to London.
