22nd. Up, and all the morning at the office busy. At noon home with my
people to dinner, where good discourse and merry. After dinner comes
Mr. Martin, the purser, and brings me his wife’s starling, which was
formerly the King’s bird, that do speak and whistle finely, which I am
mighty proud of and shall take pleasure in it. Thence to the Duke of
York’s house to a play, and saw Sir Martin Marr-all, where the house is
full; and though I have seen it, I think, ten times, yet the pleasure
I have is yet as great as ever, and is undoubtedly the best comedy ever
was wrote. Thence to my tailor’s and a mercer’s for patterns to carry my
wife of cloth and silk for a bed, which I think will please her and me,
and so home, and fitted myself for my journey to-morrow, which I fear
will not be pleasant, because of the wet weather, it raining very hard
all this day; but the less it troubles me because the King and Duke of
York and Court are at this day at Newmarket, at a great horse-race, and
proposed great pleasure for two or three days, but are in the same wet.
So from the office home to supper, and betimes to bed.
