24th. Up, and after doing some business at the office, I to London, and
there, in my way, at my old oyster shop in Gracious Streete, bought two
barrels of my fine woman of the shop, who is alive after all the
plague, which now is the first observation or inquiry we make at London
concerning everybody we knew before it. So to the ‘Change, where very
busy with several people, and mightily glad to see the ‘Change so full,
and hopes of another abatement still the next week. Off the ‘Change I
went home with Sir G. Smith to dinner, sending for one of my barrels of
oysters, which were good, though come from Colchester, where the plague
hath been so much. Here a very brave dinner, though no invitation; and,
Lord! to see how I am treated, that come from so mean a beginning,
is matter of wonder to me. But it is God’s great mercy to me, and His
blessing upon my taking pains, and being punctual in my dealings. After
dinner Captain Cocke and I about some business, and then with my
other barrel of oysters home to Greenwich, sent them by water to Mrs.
Penington, while he and I landed, and visited Mr. Evelyn, where most
excellent discourse with him; among other things he showed me a ledger
of a Treasurer of the Navy, his great grandfather, just 100 years old;
which I seemed mighty fond of, and he did present me with it, which I
take as a great rarity; and he hopes to find me more, older than it. He
also shewed us several letters of the old Lord of Leicester’s, in Queen
Elizabeth’s time, under the very hand-writing of Queen Elizabeth, and
Queen Mary, Queen of Scotts; and others, very venerable names. But,
Lord! how poorly, methinks, they wrote in those days, and in what
plain uncut paper. Thence, Cocke having sent for his coach, we to Mrs.
Penington, and there sat and talked and eat our oysters with great
pleasure, and so home to my lodging late and to bed.
