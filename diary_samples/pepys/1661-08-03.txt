3rd. Got up early the next morning and got to Barkway, where I staid
and drank, and there met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I
rode all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very
wet with rain. I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the
Assizes; and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him, and dined
with his brother, the Doctor, and Claxton at Trinity Hall. Then parted,
and I went to the Rose, and there with Mr. Pechell, Sanchy, and others,
sat and drank till night and were very merry, only they tell me how
high the old doctors are in the University over those they found there,
though a great deal better scholars than themselves; for which I am very
sorry, and, above all, Dr. Gunning. At night I took horse, and rode
with Roger Pepys and his two brothers to Impington, and there with great
respect was led up by them to the best chamber in the house, and there
slept.
