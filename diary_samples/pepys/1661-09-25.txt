25th. By coach with Sir W. Pen to Covent Garden. By the way, upon my
desire, he told me that I need not fear any reflection upon my Lord for
their ill success at Argier, for more could not be done than was done.
I went to my cozen, Thos. Pepys, there, and talked with him a good
while about our country business, who is troubled at my uncle Thomas
his folly, and so we parted; and then meeting Sir R. Slingsby in St.
Martin’s Lane, he and I in his coach through the Mewes, which is the
way that now all coaches are forced to go, because of a stop at Charing
Cross, by reason of a drain there to clear the streets. To Whitehall,
and there to Mr. Coventry, and talked with him, and thence to my Lord
Crew’s and dined with him, where I was used with all imaginable kindness
both from him and her. And I see that he is afraid that my Lord’s
reputacon will a little suffer in common talk by this late success; but
there is no help for it now. The Queen of England (as she is now owned
and called) I hear doth keep open Court, and distinct at Lisbon. Hence,
much against my nature and will, yet such is the power of the Devil over
me I could not refuse it, to the Theatre, and saw “The Merry Wives of
Windsor,” ill done. And that ended, with Sir W. Pen and Sir G. More to
the tavern, and so home with him by coach, and after supper to prayers
and to bed. In full quiet of mind as to thought, though full of
business, blessed be God.
