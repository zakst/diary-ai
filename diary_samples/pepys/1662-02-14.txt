14th (Valentine’s day). I did this day purposely shun to be seen at Sir
W. Batten’s, because I would not have his daughter to be my Valentine,
as she was the last year, there being no great friendship between us
now, as formerly. This morning in comes W. Bowyer, who was my wife’s
Valentine, she having, at which I made good sport to myself, held her
hands all the morning, that she might not see the paynters that were at
work in gilding my chimney-piece and pictures in my diningroom. By and
by she and I by coach with him to Westminster, by the way leaving at
Tom’s and my wife’s father’s lodgings each of them some poor Jack, and
some she carried to my father Bowyer’s, where she staid while I walked
in the Hall, and there among others met with Serj’. Pierce, and I took
him aside to drink a cup of ale, and he told me the basest thing of Mr.
Montagu’s and his man Eschar’s going away in debt, that I am troubled
and ashamed, but glad to be informed of. He thinks he has left L1000 for
my Lord to pay, and that he has not laid out L3,000 Out of the L5,000
for my Lord’s use, and is not able to make an account of any of the
money. My wife and I to dinner to the Wardrobe, and then to talk with my
Lady, and so by coach, it raining hard, home, and so to do business and
to bed.
