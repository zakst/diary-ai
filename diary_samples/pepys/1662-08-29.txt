29th. Up betimes and among my workmen, where I did stay with them the
greatest part of the morning, only a little at the office, and so to
dinner alone at home, and so to my workmen again, finding my presence to
carry on the work both to my mind and with more haste, and I thank God
I am pleased with it. At night, the workmen being gone, I went to my
office, and among other businesses did begin to-night with Mr. Lewes
to look into the nature of a purserâ€™s account, and the business of
victualling, in which there is great variety; but I find I shall
understand it, and be able to do service there also. So being weary and
chill, being in some fear of an ague, I went home and to bed.
