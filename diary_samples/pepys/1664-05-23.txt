23rd. Up and to the office, where Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Batten, and
myself met and did business, we being in a mighty hurry. The King is
gone down with the Duke and a great crew this morning by break of day
to Chatham. Towards noon I and my wife by water to Woolwich, leaving my
wife at Mr. Falconer’s, and Mr. Hater and I with some officers of the
yard on board to see several ships how ready they are. Then to Mr.
Falconer’s to a good dinner, having myself carried them a vessel of
sturgeon and a Lamprey pie, and then to the Yarde again, and among
other things did at Mr. Ackworth’s obtain a demonstration of his being
a knave; but I did not discover it, till it be a little more seasonable.

     a portion of a boat.]

kept ourselves dry. So to Deptford, did some business there; but, Lord!
to see how in both places the King’s business, if ever it should come to
a warr, is likely to be done, there not being a man that looks or speaks
like a man that will take pains, or use any forecast to serve the King,
at which I am heartily troubled. So home, it raining terribly, but we
still dry, and at the office late discoursing with Sir J. Minnes and
Sir W. Batten, who like a couple of sots receive all I say but to little
purpose. So late home to supper and to bed.
