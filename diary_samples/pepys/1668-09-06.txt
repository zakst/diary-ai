6d. Present the Duke of York, Arlington, Berkeley, Sir J. Minnes, and
myself. They gone, the Duke of York did tell me how hot Clifford is for
Child, and for removing of old Officers, he saying plainly to-night,
that though D. Gawden was a man that had done the best service that he
believed any man, or any ten men, could have done, yet that it was for
the King’s interest not to let it lie too long in one hand, lest nobody
should be able to serve him but one. But the Duke of York did openly
tell him that he was not for removing of old servants that have done
well, neither in this place, nor in any other place, which is very nobly
said. It being 7 or 8 at night, I home with Backewell by coach, and so
walked to D. Gawden’s, but he not at home, and so back to my chamber,
the boy to read to me, and so to supper and to bed.
