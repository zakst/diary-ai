4th (Lordâ€™s day). Busy at my Office from morning till night, in writing
with my own hand fair our large general account of the expence and debt
of the Navy, which lasted me till night to do, that I was almost blind,
and Mr. Gibson with me all day long, and dined with me, and excellent
discourse I had with him, he understanding all the business of the Navy
most admirably. To walk a little with my wife at night in the garden, it
being very hot weather again, and so to supper and to bed.
