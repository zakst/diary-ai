31st. Up, and at the office all the morning. At noon home to dinner with
my people, and afternoon to the office again, and then to my chamber
with Gibson to do more about my great answer for the Duke of York, and
so at night after supper to bed well pleased with my advance thereon.
This day my Lord Anglesey was at the Office, and do seem to make nothing
of this business of his suspension, resolving to bring it into the
Council, where he seems not to doubt to have right, he standing upon his
defence and patent, and hath put in his caveats to the several Offices:
so, as soon as the King comes back again, which will be on Tuesday next,
he will bring it into the Council. So ends this month with some quiet to
my mind, though not perfect, after the greatest falling out with my poor
wife, and through my folly with the girl, that ever I had, and I have
reason to be sorry and ashamed of it, and more to be troubled for the
poor girlâ€™s sake, whom I fear I shall by this means prove the ruin of,
though I shall think myself concerned both to love and be a friend to
her. This day Roger Pepys and his son Talbot, newly come to town, come
and dined with me, and mighty glad I am to see them.
