3rd. Sir W. Pen and I by coach to St. James’s, and there to the Duke’s
Chamber, who had been a-hunting this morning and is come back again.
Thence to Westminster, where I met Mr. Moore, and hear that Mr. Watkins’
is suddenly dead since my going. To dinner to my Lady Sandwich, and Sir
Thomas Crew’s children coming thither, I took them and all my Ladys to
the Tower and showed them the lions

     [The Tower Menagerie was not abolished until the reign of
     William IV.]

and all that was to be shown, and so took them to my house, and there
made much of them, and so saw them back to my Lady’s. Sir Thomas Crew’s
children being as pretty and the best behaved that ever I saw of their
age. Thence, at the goldsmith’s, took my picture in little,--[Miniature
by Savill]--which is now done, home with me, and pleases me exceedingly
and my wife. So to supper and to bed, it being exceeding hot.
