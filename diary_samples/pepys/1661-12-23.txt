23rd. Early up and by coach (before daylight) to the Wardrobe, and took
up Mr. Moore, and he and I to Chelsy to my Lord Privy Seal, and there
sealed some things, he being to go out of town for all Christmas
to-morrow. So back again to Westminster, and from thence by water to
the Treasury Office, where I found Sir W. Pen paying off the Sophia and
Griffen, and there I staid with him till noon, and having sent for some
collar of beef and a mince pie, we eat and drank, and so I left him
there and to my brother’s by appointment to meet Prior, but he came not,
so I went and saw Mrs. Turner who continues weak, and by and by word was
brought me that Prior’s man was come to Tom’s, and so I went and told
out L128 which I am to receive of him, but Prior not coming I went away
and left the money by his desire with my brother all night, and they
to come to me to-morrow morning. So I took coach, and lighting at my
bookseller’s in Paul’s Churchyard, I met with Mr. Crumlum and the second
master of Paul’s School, and thence I took them to the Starr, and there
we sat and talked, and I had great pleasure in their company, and very
glad I was of meeting him so accidentally, I having omitted too long to
go to see him. Here in discourse of books I did offer to give the school
what books he would choose of L5. So we parted, and I home, and to Mr.
Selden, and then to bed.
