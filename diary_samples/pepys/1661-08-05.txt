5th. Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton
because of the rain, and there borrowed a coat of a man for 6d., and so
he rode all the way, poor man, without any. Staid at Huntingdon for a
little, but the judges are not come hither: so I went to Brampton, and
there found my father very well, and my aunt gone from the house, which
I am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money, viz. L10. Here
I dined, and after dinner took horse and rode to Yelling, to my cozen
Nightingaleâ€™s, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all
she could tell me concerning my business, and has given me some light by
her discourse how I may get a surrender made for Graveley lands. Hence
to Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chancler and Jackson (one
of my tenants for Cotton closes) and another with whom I had a great
deal of discourse, much to my satisfaction. Hence back again to Brampton
and after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a
content to us.
