19th (Easter day). Up and this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit,
which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled
sword, is very handsome. To church alone, and so to dinner, where my
father and brother Tom dined with us, and after dinner to church again,
my father sitting below in the chancel. After church done, where the
young Scotchman preaching I slept all the while, my father and I to see
my uncle and aunt Wight, and after a stay of an hour there my father to
my brother’s and I home to supper, and after supper fell in discourse of
dancing, and I find that Ashwell hath a very fine carriage, which
makes my wife almost ashamed of herself to see herself so outdone, but
to-morrow she begins to learn to dance for a month or two. So to prayers
and to bed. Will being gone, with my leave, to his father’s this day for
a day or two, to take physique these holydays.
