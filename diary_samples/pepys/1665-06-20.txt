20th. Thankes-giving-day for victory over ye Dutch. Up, and to the
office, where very busy alone all the morning till church time, and
there heard a mean sorry sermon of Mr. Mills. Then to the Dolphin
Taverne, where all we officers of the Navy met with the Commissioners
of the Ordnance by agreement, and dined: where good musique at my
direction. Our club--[share]

             [“Next these a sort of Sots there are,
               Who crave more wine than they can bear,
               Yet hate, when drunk, to pay or spend
               Their equal Club or Dividend,
               But wrangle, when the Bill is brought,
               And think they’re cheated when they’re not.”

--come to 34s. a man, nine of us. Thence after dinner, to White Hall
with Sir W. Berkely in his coach, and so walked to Herbert’s and there
spent a little time.... Thence by water to Fox-hall, and there walked
an hour alone, observing the several humours of the citizens that were
there this holyday, pulling of cherries,--[The game of bob-cherry]--and
God knows what, and so home to my office, where late, my wife not being
come home with my mother, who have been this day all abroad upon the
water, my mother being to go out of town speedily. So I home and to
supper and to bed, my wife come home when I come from the office. This
day I informed myself that there died four or five at Westminster of the
plague in one alley in several houses upon Sunday last, Bell Alley, over
against the Palace-gate; yet people do think that the number will be
fewer in the towne than it was the last weeke! The Dutch are come out
again with 20 sail under Bankert; supposed gone to the Northward to
meete their East India fleete.
