19th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon dined
at home very pleasantly with my wife, and after dinner with a great deal
of pleasure had her sing, which she begins to do with some pleasure
to me, more than I expected. Then to the office again, where all the
afternoon close, and at night home to supper and to bed. It comes in my
mind this night to set down how a house was the other day in Bishopsgate
Street blowed up with powder; a house that was untenanted, and between a
flax shop and a-----------, both bad for fire; but, thanks be to God, it
did no more hurt; and all do conclude it a plot. I would also remember
to my shame how I was pleased yesterday, to find the righteous maid of
Magister Griffin sweeping of ‘nostra’ office, ‘elle con the Roman nariz
and bonne’ body which I did heretofore like, and do still refresh me to
think ‘que elle’ is come to us, that I may ‘voir her aliquando’. This
afternoon I am told again that the town do talk of my Lord Arlington’s
being to be Lord Treasurer, and Sir W. Coventry to be Secretary of
State; and that for certain the match is concluded between the Duke of
Richmond and Mrs. Stewart, which I am well enough pleased with; and it
is pretty to consider how his quality will allay people’s talk; whereas,
had a meaner person married her, he would for certain have been reckoned
a cuckold at first-dash.
