31st (Lord’s day). Up, and to church in the morning. At noon I sent for
Mr. Mills and his wife and daughter to dine, and they dined with me, and
W. Hewer, and very good company, I being in good humour. They gone to
church, comes Mr. Tempest, and he and I sang a psalm or two, and so
parted, and I by water to the New Exchange, and there to Mrs. Pierces,
where Knepp, and she, and W. Howe, and Mr. Pierce, and little Betty,
over to Fox Hall, and there walked and supped with great pleasure. Here
was Mrs. Manuel also, and mighty good company, and good mirth in
making W. Howe spend his six or seven shillings, and so they called him
altogether “Cully.” So back, and at Somerset-stairs do understand that
a boy is newly drowned, washing himself there, and they cannot find his
body. So seeing them home, I home by water, W. Howe going with me, and
after some talk he lay at my house, and all to bed. Here I hear that
Mrs. Davis is quite gone from the Duke of York’s house, and Gosnell
comes in her room, which I am glad of. At the play at Court the other
night, Mrs. Davis was there; and when she was to come to dance her jigg,
the Queene would not stay to see it, which people do think it was out of
displeasure at her being the King’s whore, that she could not bear it.
My Lady Castlemayne is, it seems, now mightily out of request, the King
coming little to her, and thus she mighty melancholy and discontented.
