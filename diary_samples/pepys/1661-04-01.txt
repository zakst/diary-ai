April 1st, 1661. This day my waiting at the Privy Seal comes in again.
Up early among my workmen. So to the once, and went home to dinner with
Sir W. Batten, and after that to the Goat tavern by Charing Cross to
meet Dr. Castle, where he and I drank a pint of wine and talked about
Privy Seal business. Then to the Privy Seal Office and there found Mr.
Moore, but no business yet. Then to Whitefryars, and there saw part of
“Rule a wife and have a wife,” which I never saw before, but do not like
it. So to my father, and there finding a discontent between my
father and mother about the maid (which my father likes and my mother
dislikes), I staid till 10 at night, persuading my mother to understand
herself, and that in some high words, which I was sorry for, but she is
grown, poor woman, very froward. So leaving them in the same discontent
I went away home, it being a brave moonshine, and to bed.
