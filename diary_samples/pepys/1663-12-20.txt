20th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and alone to church, where a common sermon of Mr.
Mills, and so home to dinner in our parler, my wife being clean, and
the first time we have dined here a great while together, and in the
afternoon went to church with me also, and there begun to take her place
above Mrs. Pen, which heretofore out of a humour she was wont to
give her as an affront to my Lady Batten. After a dull sermon of the
Scotchman, home, and there I found my brother Tom and my two cozens
Scotts, he and she, the first time they were ever here. And by and by
in comes my uncle. Wight and Mr. Norbury, and they sat with us a while
drinking, of wine, of which I did give them plenty. But the two would
not stay supper, but the other two did. And we were as merry as I could
be with people that I do wish well to, but know not what discourse
either to give them or find from them. We showed them our house from top
to bottom, and had a good Turkey roasted for our supper, and store of
wine, and after supper sent them home on foot, and so we to prayers and
to bed.
