5th. At the office all the morning, do hear that Will Pen, Sir W. Pen’s
son, is come from Ireland, but I have not seen him yet. At noon to
the ‘Change, where did little, but so home again and to dinner with my
clerks with me, and very good discourse and company they give me, and so
to the office all the afternoon till late, and so home to supper and to
bed. This day, not for want, but for good husbandry, I sent my father,
by his desire, six pair of my old shoes, which fit him, and are good;
yet, methought, it was a thing against my mind to have him wear my old
things.
