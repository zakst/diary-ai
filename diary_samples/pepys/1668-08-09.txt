9th (Lord’s day). Up, and walked to Holborne, where got John Powell’s
coach at the Black Swan, and he attended me at St. James’s, where waited
on the Duke of York: and both by him and several of the Privy-Council,
beyond expectation, I find that my going to Sir Thomas Allen was looked
upon as a thing necessary: and I have got some advantage by it, among
them. Thence to White Hall, and thence to visit Lord Brouncker, and
back to White Hall, where saw the Queen and ladies; and so, with Mr.
Slingsby, to Mrs. Williams’s, thinking to dine with Lord Brouncker
there, but did not, having promised my wife to come home, though here
I met Knepp, to my great content. So home; and, after dinner, I took my
wife and Deb. round by Hackney, and up and down to take the ayre; and
then home, and made visits to Mrs. Turner, and Mrs. Mercer, and Sir W.
Pen, who is come from Epsom not well, and Sir J. Minnes, who is not well
neither. And so home to supper, and to set my books a little right, and
then to bed. This day Betty Michell come and dined with us, the first
day after her lying in, whom I was glad to see.
