9th. Called up, as I had appointed, by H. Russell, between two and three
o’clock, and I and my boy Tom by water with a gally down to the Hope, it
being a fine starry night. Got thither by eight o’clock, and there, as
expected, found the Charles, her mainmast setting. Commissioner Pett
aboard. I up and down to see the ship I was so well acquainted with,
and a great worke it is, the setting so great a mast. Thence the
Commissioner and I on board Sir G. Ascue, in the Henery, who lacks men
mightily, which makes me think that there is more believed to be in
a man that hath heretofore been employed than truly there is; for one
would never have thought, a month ago, that he would have wanted 1000
men at his heels. Nor do I think he hath much of a seaman in him: for
he told me, says he, “Heretofore, we used to find our ships clear and
ready, everything to our hands in the Downes. Now I come, and must look
to see things done like a slave, things that I never minded, nor
cannot look after.” And by his discourse I find that he hath not minded
anything in her at all. Thence not staying, the wind blowing hard, I
made use of the Jemmy yacht and returned to the Tower in her, my boy
being a very droll boy and good company. Home and eat something, and
then shifted myself, and to White Hall, and there the King being in his
Cabinet Council (I desiring to speak with Sir G. Carteret), I was called
in, and demanded by the King himself many questions, to which I did
give him full answers. There were at this Council my Lord Chancellor,
Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Treasurer, the two Secretarys, and Sir G.
Carteret. Not a little contented at this chance of being made known to
these persons, and called often by my name by the King, I to Mr. Pierces
to take leave of him, but he not within, but saw her and made very
little stay, but straight home to my office, where I did business, and
then to supper and to bed. The Duke of York is this day gone away to
Portsmouth.
