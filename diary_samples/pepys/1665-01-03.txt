3rd. Up, and by coach to Sir Ph. Warwicke’s, the streete being full
of footballs, it being a great frost, and found him and Mr. Coventry
walking in St. James’s Parke. I did my errand to him about the felling
of the King’s timber in the forests, and then to my Lord of Oxford,
Justice in Eyre, for his consent thereto, for want whereof my Lord Privy
Seale stops the whole business. I found him in his lodgings, in but an
ordinary furnished house and roome where he was, but I find him to be a
man of good discreet replys. Thence to the Coffee-house, where certain
newes that the Dutch have taken some of our colliers to the North; some
say four, some say seven. Thence to the ‘Change a while, and so home
to dinner and to the office, where we sat late, and then I to write
my letters, and then to Sir W. Batten’s, who is going out of towne to
Harwich to-morrow to set up a light-house there, which he hath lately
got a patent from the King to set up, that will turne much to his
profit. Here very merry, and so to my office again, where very late, and
then home to supper and to bed, but sat up with my wife at cards till
past two in the morning.
