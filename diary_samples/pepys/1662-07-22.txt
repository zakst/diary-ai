22d. Among my workmen early: then to the office, and there I had letters
from the Downs from Mr. Coventry; who tells me of the foul weather they
had last Sunday, that drove them back from near Boulogne, whither they
were going for the Queen, back again to the Downs, with the loss
of their cables, sayles, and masts; but are all safe, only my Lord
Sandwich, who went before with the yachts; they know not what is become
of him, which do trouble me much; but I hope he got ashore before the
storm begun; which God grant! All day at the office, only at home at
dinner, where I was highly angry with my wife for her keys being out
of the way, but they were found at last, and so friends again. All the
afternoon answering letters and writing letters, and at night to Mr.
Coventry an ample letter in answer to all his and the Dukeâ€™s business.
Late at night at the office, where my business is great, being now all
alone in town, but I shall go through it with pleasure. So home and to
bed.
