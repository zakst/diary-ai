18th. To White Hall, to Mr. Montagu’s, where I met with Mr. Pierce, the
purser, to advise about the things to be sent to my Lord for the Queen’s
provision, and was cleared in it, and now there is all haste made, for
the fleet’s going. At noon to my Lord’s to dinner, and in the afternoon,
leaving my wife there, Mr. Moore and I to Mrs. Goldsborough, who
sent for a friend to meet with us, and so we were talking about the
difference between us till 10 at night. I find it very troublesome, and
have brought it into some hopes of an agreement, I offering to forgive
her L10 that is yet due according to my uncle’s accounts to us. So we
left her friend to advise about it, and I hope to hear of her, for I
would not by any means go to law with a woman of so devilish a tongue as
she has. So to my Lady’s, where I left my wife to lie with Mademoiselle
all night, and I by link home and to bed. This night lying alone, and
the weather cold, and having this last 7 or 8 days been troubled with
a tumor... which is now abated by a poultice of a good handful of bran
with half a pint of vinegar and a pint of water boiled till it be thick,
and then a spoonful of honey put to it and so spread in a cloth and laid
to it, I first put on my waistcoat to lie in all night this year, and
do not intend to put it off again till spring. I met with complaints at
home that my wife left no victuals for them all this day.
