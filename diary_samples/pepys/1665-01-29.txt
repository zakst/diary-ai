29th (Lord’s day). Up and to my office, where all the morning, putting
papers to rights which now grow upon my hands. At noon dined at home.
All the afternoon at my business again. In the evening come Mr. Andrews
and Hill, and we up to my chamber and there good musique, though my
great cold made it the less pleasing to me. Then Mr. Hill (the other
going away) and I to supper alone, my wife not appearing, our
discourse upon the particular vain humours of Mr. Povy, which are very
extraordinary indeed. After supper I to Sir W. Batten’s, where I found
him, Sir W. Pen, Sir J. Robinson, Sir R. Ford and Captain Cocke and
Mr. Pen, junior. Here a great deal of sorry disordered talk about the
Trinity House men, their being exempted from land service. But, Lord! to
see how void of method and sense their discourse was, and in what heat,
insomuch as Sir R. Ford (who we judged, some of us, to be a little
foxed) fell into very high terms with Sir W. Batten, and then with
Captain Cocke. So that I see that no man is wise at all times. Thence
home to prayers and to bed.
