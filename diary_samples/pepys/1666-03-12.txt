12th. Up betimes, and called on by abundance of people about business,
and then away by water to Westminster, and there to the Exchequer about
some business, and thence by coach calling at several places, to the
Old Exchange, and there did much business, and so homeward and bought
a silver salt for my ordinary table to use, and so home to dinner, and
after dinner comes my uncle and aunt Wight, the latter I have not seen
since the plague; a silly, froward, ugly woman she is. We made mighty
much of them, and she talks mightily of her fear of the sicknesse, and
so a deale of tittle tattle and I left them and to my office where late,
and so home to supper and to bed. This day I hear my Uncle Talbot Pepys
died the last week, and was buried. All the news now is, that Sir
Jeremy Smith is at Cales--[Cadiz]--with his fleete, and Mings in the
Elve.--[Elbe]--The King is come this noon to towne from Audly End, with
the Duke of Yorke and a fine train of gentlemen.
