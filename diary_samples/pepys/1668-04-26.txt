26th (Lord’s day). Lay long, and then up and to Church, and so home,
where there come and dined with me Harris, Rolt, and Bannister, and
one Bland, that sings well also, and very merry at dinner, and, after
dinner, to sing all the afternoon. But when all was done, I did begin
to think that the pleasure of these people was not worth so often charge
and cost to me, as it hath occasioned me. They being gone I and Balty
walked as far as Charing Cross, and there got a coach and to Hales’s the
painter, thinking to have found Harris sitting there for his picture,
which is drawing for me. But he, and all this day’s company, and Hales,
were got to the Crown tavern, at next door, and thither I to them and
stayed a minute, leaving Captain Grant telling pretty stories of people
that have killed themselves, or been accessory to it, in revenge to
other people, and to mischief other people, and thence with Hales to
his house, and there did see his beginning of Harris’s picture, which I
think will be pretty like, and he promises a very good picture. Thence
with Balty away and got a coach and to Hide Park, and there up and down
and did drink some milk at the Lodge, and so home and to bed.
