30th. Up, and with Sir W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes to the Committee of
the Lords, and there did our business; but, Lord! what a sorry dispatch
these great persons give to business. Thence to the ‘Change, and there
hear the certainty and circumstances of the Dutch having called in their
fleete and paid their men half-pay, the other to be paid them upon their
being ready upon beat of drum to come to serve them again, and in the
meantime to have half-pay. This is said. Thence home to dinner, and so
to my office all the afternoon. In the evening my wife and Sir W. Warren
with me to White Hall, sending her with the coach to see her father and
mother. He and I up to Sir G. Carteret, and first I alone and then both
had discourse with him about things of the Navy, and so I and he calling
my wife at Unthanke’s, home again, and long together talking how to
order things in a new contract for Norway goods, as well to the King’s
as to his advantage. He gone, I to my monthly accounts, and, bless God!
I find I have increased my last balance, though but little; but I hope
ere long to get more. In the meantime praise God for what I have, which
is L1209. So, with my heart glad to see my accounts fall so right in
this time of mixing of monies and confusion, I home to bed.
