12th. This morning, till four in the afternoon, I spent abroad, doing of
many and considerable businesses at Mr. Phillips the lawyer, with Prior,
Westminster, my Lord Crew’s, Wardrobe, &c., and so home about the time
of day to dinner with my mind very highly contented with my day’s work,
wishing I could do so every day. Then to my chamber drawing up writings,
in expectation of my uncle Thomas corning. So to my musique and then to
bed. This night I had half a 100 poor Jack--[The “poor john” is a hake
salted and dried. It is frequently referred to in old authors as poor
fare.]--sent me by Mr. Adis.
