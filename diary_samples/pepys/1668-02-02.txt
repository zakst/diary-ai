2nd (Lordâ€™s day). Wife took physick this day, I all day at home, and all
the morning setting my books in order in my presses, for the following
year, their number being much increased since the last, so as I am fain
to lay by several books to make room for better, being resolved to keep
no more than just my presses will contain. At noon to dinner, my wife
coming down to me, and a very good dinner we had, of a powdered leg of
pork and a loin of lamb roasted, and with much content she and I and
Deb. After dinner, my head combed an hour, and then to work again, and
at it, doing many things towards the setting my accounts and papers in
order, and so in the evening Mr. Pelling supping with us, and to supper,
and so to bed.
