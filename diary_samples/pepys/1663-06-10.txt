10th. Up and all the morning helping my wife to put up her things
towards her going into the country and drawing the wine out of my vessel
to send. This morning came my cozen Thomas Pepys to desire me to furnish
him with some money, which I could not do till his father has wrote to
Piggott his consent to the sale of his lands, so by and by we parted and
I to the Exchange a while and so home and to dinner, and thence to
the Royal Theatre by water, and landing, met with Captain Ferrers his
friend, the little man that used to be with him, and he with us, and sat
by us while we saw “Love in a Maze.” The play is pretty good, but the
life of the play is Lacy’s part, the clown, which is most admirable;
but for the rest, which are counted such old and excellent actors, in my
life I never heard both men and women so ill pronounce their parts, even
to my making myself sick therewith. Thence, Creed happening to be with
us, we four to the Half-Moon Tavern, I buying some sugar and carrying
it with me, which we drank with wine and thence to the whay-house, and
drank a great deal of whay, and so by water home, and thence to see Sir
W. Pen, who is not in much pain, but his legs swell and so immoveable
that he cannot stir them, but as they are lifted by other people and I
doubt will have another fit of his late pain. Played a little at cards
with him and his daughter, who is grown every day a finer and finer
lady, and so home to supper and to bed. When my wife and I came first
home we took Ashwell and all the rest below in the cellar with the
vintner drawing out my wine, which I blamed Ashwell much for and told
her my mind that I would not endure it, nor was it fit for her to make
herself equal with the ordinary servants of the house.
