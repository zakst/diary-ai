22nd. In the morning intended to have gone to Mr. Crew’s to borrow some
money, but it raining I forbore, and went to my Lord’s lodging and look
that all things were well there. Then home and sang a song to my viall,
so to my office and to Will’s, where Mr. Pierce found me out, and told
me that he would go with me to Cambridge, where Colonel Ayre’s regiment,
to which he was surgeon, lieth. Walking in the Hall, I saw Major-General
Brown, who had along time been banished by the Rump, but now with his
beard overgrown, he comes abroad and sat in the House. To my father’s
to dinner, where nothing but a small dish of powdered beef--[Boiled
salt beef. To powder was to sprinkle with salt, and the powdering tub a
vessel in which meat was salted.]--and dish of carrots; they being all
busy to get things ready for my brother John to go to-morrow. After
dinner, my wife staying there, I went to Mr. Crew’s, and got; L5 of Mr.
Andrews, and so to Mrs. Jemimah, who now hath her instrument about her
neck, and indeed is infinitely, altered, and holds her head upright. I
paid her, maid 40s. of the money that I have received of Mr. Andrews.
Hence home to my study, where I only wrote thus much of this day’s
passages to this * and so out again. To White Hall, where I met with
Will. Simons and Mr. Mabbot at Marsh’s, who told me how the House had
this day voted that the gates of the City should be set up at the cost
of the State. And that Major-General Brown’s being proclaimed a traitor
be made void, and several other things of that nature. Home for my
lanthorn and so to my father’s, where I directed John what books to put
for Cambridge. After that to supper, where my Uncle Fenner and my Aunt,
The. Turner, and Joyce, at a brave leg of veal roasted, and were
very merry against John’s going to Cambridge. I observed this day how
abominably Barebone’s windows are broke again last night. At past 9
o’clock my wife and I went home.
