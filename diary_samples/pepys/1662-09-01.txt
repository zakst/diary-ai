September 1st. Up betimes at my lodging and to my office and among my
workmen, and then with Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen by coach to St.
James’s, this being the first day of our meeting there by the Duke’s
order; but when we come, we found him going out by coach with his
Duchess, and he told us he was to go abroad with the Queen to-day (to
Durdans, it seems, to dine with my Lord Barkeley, where I have been very
merry when I was a little boy); so we went and staid a little at Mr.
Coventry’s chamber, and I to my Lord Sandwich’s, who is gone to wait
upon the King and Queen today. And so Mr. Paget being there, Will Howe
and I and he played over some things of Locke’s that we used to play at
sea, that pleased us three well, it being the first music I have heard
a great while, so much has my business of late taken me off from all
my former delights. By and by by water home, and there dined alone, and
after dinner with my brother Tom’s two men I removed all my goods out of
Sir W. Pen’s house into one room that I have with much ado got ready at
my house, and so I am to be quit of any further obligation to him. So to
my office, but missing my key, which I had in my hand just now, makes me
very angry and out of order, it being a thing that I hate in others, and
more in myself, to be careless of keys, I thinking another not fit to be
trusted that leaves a key behind their hole. One thing more vexes me: my
wife writes me from the country that her boy plays the rogue there, and
she is weary of him, and complains also of her maid Sarah, of which I
am also very sorry. Being thus out of temper, I could do little at my
office, but went home and eat a bit, and so to my lodging to bed.
