28th. Up, and with Sir W. Pen to White Hall (setting his lady and
daughter down by the way at a mercer’s in the Strand, where they are
going to lay out some money), where, though it blows hard and rains
hard, yet the Duke of York is gone a-hunting. We therefore lost our
labour, and so back again, and by hackney coach to secure places to get
things ready against dinner, and then home, and did the like there, and
to my great satisfaction: and at noon comes my Lord Hinchingbroke, Sir
Thomas Crew, Mr. John Crew, Mr. Carteret, and Brisband. I had six noble
dishes for them, dressed by a man-cook, and commended, as indeed they
deserved, for exceeding well done. We eat with great pleasure, and I
enjoyed myself in it with reflections upon the pleasures which I at best
can expect, yet not to exceed this; eating in silver plates, and
all things mighty rich and handsome about me. A great deal of fine
discourse, sitting almost till dark at dinner, and then broke up with
great pleasure, especially to myself; and they away, only Mr. Carteret
and I to Gresham College, where they meet now weekly again, and here
they had good discourse how this late experiment of the dog, which is
in perfect good health, may be improved for good uses to men, and other
pretty things, and then broke up. Here was Mr. Henry Howard, that
will hereafter be Duke of Norfolke, who is admitted this day into the
Society, and being a very proud man, and one that values himself upon
his family, writes his name, as he do every where, Henry Howard of
Norfolke. Thence home and there comes my Lady Pen, Pegg, and Mrs.
Turner, and played at cards and supped with us, and were pretty merry,
and Pegg with me in my closet a good while, and did suffer me ‘a la
baiser mouche et toucher ses cosas’ upon her breast, wherein I had great
pleasure, and so spent the evening and then broke up, and I to bed, my
mind mightily pleased with the day’s entertainment.
