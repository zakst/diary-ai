May 1st, 1668. Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy. Then
to Westminster Hall, and there met Sir W. Pen, who labours to have his
answer to his impeachment, and sent down from the Lords’ House, read
by the House of Commons; but they are so busy on other matters, that he
cannot, and thereby will, as he believes, by design, be prevented from
going to sea this year. Here met my cozen Thomas Pepys of Deptford,
and took some turns with him; who is mightily troubled for this Act now
passed against Conventicles, and in few words, and sober, do lament the
condition we are in, by a negligent Prince and a mad Parliament. Thence
I by coach to the Temple, and there set him down, and then to Sir G.
Carteret’s to dine, but he not being at home, I back again to the New
Exchange a little, and thence back again to Hercules Pillars, and there
dined all alone, and then to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The
Surprizall;” and a disorder in the pit by its raining in, from the
cupola at top, it being a very foul day, and cold, so as there are few
I believe go to the Park to-day, if any. Thence to Westminster Hall,
and there I understand how the Houses of Commons and Lords are like to
disagree very much, about the business of the East India Company and one
Skinner; to the latter of which the Lords have awarded L5000 from the
former, for some wrong done him heretofore; and the former appealing
to the Commons, the Lords vote their petition a libell; and so there is
like to follow very hot work. Thence by water, not being able to get a
coach, nor boat but a sculler, and that with company, is being so foul
a day, to the Old Swan, and so home, and there spent the evening, making
Balty read to me, and so to supper and to bed.
