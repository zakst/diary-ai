21st. In the morning again at looking over my last night’s papers, and
by and by comes Mr. Moore, who finds that my papers may do me much good.
He staid and dined with me, and we had a good surloyne of rost beefe,
the first that ever I had of my own buying since I kept house; and after
dinner he and I to the Temple, and there showed Mr. Smallwood my papers,
who likes them well, and so I left them with him, and went with Mr.
Moore to Gray’s Inn to his chamber, and there he shewed me his old
Camden’s “Britannica”, which I intend to buy of him, and so took it away
with me, and left it at St. Paul’s Churchyard to be bound, and so home
and to the office all the afternoon; it being the first afternoon that
we have sat, which we are now to do always, so long as the Parliament
sits, who this day have voted the King L 120,000

     [A mistake.  According to the journals, L1,200,000.  And see Diary,
