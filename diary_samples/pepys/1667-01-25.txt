25th. Lay pretty long, then to the office, where Lord Bruncker and Sir
J. Minnes and I did meet, and sat private all the morning about dividing
the Controller’s work according to the late order of Council, between
them two and Sir W. Pen, and it troubled me to see the poor honest man,
Sir J. Minnes, troubled at it, and yet the King’s work cannot be done
without it. It was at last friendlily ended, and so up and home to
dinner with my wife. This afternoon I saw the Poll Bill, now printed;
wherein I do fear I shall be very deeply concerned, being to be taxed
for all my offices, and then for my money that I have, and my title,
as well as my head. It is a very great tax; but yet I do think it is so
perplexed, it will hardly ever be collected duly. The late invention
of Sir G. Downing’s is continued of bringing all the money into the
Exchequer; and Sir G. Carteret’s three pence is turned for all the money
of this act into but a penny per pound, which I am sorry for. After
dinner to the office again, where Lord Bruncker, [Sir] W. Batten, and
[Sir] W. Pen and I met to talk again about the Controller’s office, and
there [Sir] W. Pen would have a piece of the great office cut out to
make an office for him, which I opposed to the making him very angry,
but I think I shall carry it against him, and then I care not. So a
little troubled at this fray, I away by coach with my wife, and left
her at the New Exchange, and I to my Lord Chancellor’s, and then back,
taking up my wife to my Lord Bellasses, and there spoke with Mr. Moone,
who tells me that the peace between us and Spayne is, as he hears,
concluded on, which I should be glad of, and so home, and after a little
at my office, home to finish my journall for yesterday and to-day, and
then a little supper and to bed. This day the House hath passed the Bill
for the Assessment, which I am glad of; and also our little Bill, for
giving any one of us in the office the power of justice of peace, is
done as I would have it.
