27th. Up, and after a harsh word or two my wife and I good friends, and
so up and to the office, where all the morning. At noon late to dinner,
my wife gone out to Hales’s about her picture, and, after dinner, I
after her, and do mightily like her picture, and think it will be as
good as my Lady Peters’s. So home mightily pleased, and there late at
business and set down my three last days’ journalls, and so to bed,
overjoyed to thinke of the pleasure of the last Sunday and yesterday,
and my ability to bear the charge of these pleasures, and with profit
too, by obliging my Lord, and reconciling Sir George Carteret’s family.
