26th. Up betimes, and prepared to my great satisfaction an account for
the board of my office disbursements, which I had suffered to run on to
almost L120. That done I down by water to Greenwich, where we met the
first day my Lord Bruncker, Sir J. Minnes, and I, and I think we shall
do well there, and begin very auspiciously to me by having my account
abovesaid passed, and put into a way of having it presently paid.
When we rose I find Mr. Andrews and Mr. Yeabsly, who is just come from
Plymouth, at the door, and we walked together toward my Lord Brunker’s,
talking about their business, Yeabsly being come up on purpose to
discourse with me about it, and finished all in a quarter of an hour,
and is gone again. I perceive they have some inclination to be going on
with their victualling-business for a while longer before they resign
it to Mr. Gauden, and I am well contented, for it brings me very good
profit with certainty, yet with much care and some pains. We parted
at my Lord Bruncker’s doore, where I went in, having never been there
before, and there he made a noble entertainment for Sir J. Minnes,
myself, and Captain Cocke, none else saving some painted lady that dined
there, I know not who she is. But very merry we were, and after dinner
into the garden, and to see his and her chamber, where some good
pictures, and a very handsome young woman for my lady’s woman. Thence I
by water home, in my way seeing a man taken up dead, out of the hold
of a small catch that lay at Deptford. I doubt it might be the plague,
which, with the thought of Dr. Burnett, did something disturb me, so
that I did not what I intended and should have done at the office, as
to business, but home sooner than ordinary, and after supper, to read
melancholy alone, and then to bed.
