25th. At the office all the morning, reading Mr. Holland’s’ discourse
of the Navy, lent me by Mr. Turner, and am much pleased with them,
they hitting the very diseases of the Navy, which we are troubled
with now-a-days. I shall bestow writing of them over and much reading
thereof. This morning Sir W. Batten came in to the office and desired
to speak with me; he began by telling me that he observed a strangeness
between him and me of late, and would know the reason of it, telling
me he heard that I was offended with merchants coming to his house and
making contracts there. I did tell him that as a friend I had spoke of
it to Sir W. Pen and desired him to take a time to tell him of it, and
not as a backbiter, with which he was satisfied, but I find that Sir W.
Pen has played the knave with me, and not told it from me as a friend,
but in a bad sense. He also told me that he heard that exceptions were
taken at his carrying his wife down to Portsmouth, saying that the King
should not pay for it, but I denied that I had spoke of it, nor did I.
At last he desired the difference between our wives might not make a
difference between us, which I was exceedingly glad to hear, and do
see every day the fruit of looking after my business, which I pray God
continue me in, for I do begin to be very happy. Dined at home, and so
to the office all the afternoon again, and at night home and to bed.
