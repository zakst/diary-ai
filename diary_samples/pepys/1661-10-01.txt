October 1st. This morning my wife and I lay long in bed, and among other
things fell into talk of musique, and desired that I would let her learn
to sing, which I did consider, and promised her she should. So before
I rose, word was brought me that my singing master, Mr. Goodgroome, was
come to teach me and so she rose and this morning began to learn also.
To the office, where busy all day. So to dinner and then to the office
again till night, and then to my study at home to set matters and papers
in order, which, though I can hardly bring myself to do, yet do please
me much when it is done. So eat a bit of bread and cheese, and to bed.
