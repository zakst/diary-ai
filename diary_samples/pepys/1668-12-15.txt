15th. Up, and to the Office, where sat all the morning, and the new
Treasurers there; and, for my life, I cannot keep Sir J. Minnes and
others of the Board from shewing our weakness, to the dishonour of the
Board, though I am not concerned but it do vex me to the heart to
have it before these people, that would be glad to find out all our
weaknesses. At noon Mrs. Mary Batelier with us, and so, after dinner,
I with W. Hewer all the afternoon till night beginning to draw up our
answer to Middleton, and it proves troublesome, because I have so much
in my head at a time to say, but I must go through with it. So at night
to supper and to bed.
