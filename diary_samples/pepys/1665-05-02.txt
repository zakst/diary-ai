2nd. Up and to the office all day, where sat late, and then to the
office again, and by and by Sir W. Batten and my Lady and my wife and I
by appointment yesterday (my Lady Pen failed us, who ought to have been
with us) to the Rhenish winehouse at the Steelyard, and there eat a
couple of lobsters and some prawns, and pretty merry, especially to see
us four together, while my wife and my Lady did never intend ever to be
together again after a yearâ€™s distance between one another. Hither by
and by come Sir Richard Ford and also Mrs. Esther, that lived formerly
with my Lady Batten, now well married to a priest, come to see my Lady.
Thence toward evening home, and to my office, where late, and then home
to supper and to bed.
