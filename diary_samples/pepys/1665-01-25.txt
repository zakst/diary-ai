25th. Up, and busy all the morning, dined at home upon a hare pye, very
good meat, and so to my office again, and in the afternoon by coach to
attend the Council at White Hall, but come too late, so back with Mr.
Gifford, a merchant, and he and I to the Coffee-house, where I met Mr.
Hill, and there he tells me that he is to be Assistant to the Secretary
of the Prize Office (Sir Ellis Layton), which is to be held at Sir
Richard Fordâ€™s, which, methinks, is but something low, but perhaps may
bring him something considerable; but it makes me alter my opinion of
his being so rich as to make a fortune for Mrs. Pickering. Thence home
and visited Sir J. Minnes, who continues ill, but is something better;
there he told me what a mad freaking fellow Sir Ellis Layton hath been,
and is, and once at Antwerp was really mad. Thence to my office late,
my cold troubling me, and having by squeezing myself in a coach hurt my
testicles, but I hope will cease its pain without swelling. So home out
of order, to supper and to bed.
