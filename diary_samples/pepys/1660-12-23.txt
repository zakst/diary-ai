23rd (Lord’s day). In the morning to Church, where our pew all covered
with rosemary and baize. A stranger made a dull sermon. Home and found
my wife and maid with much ado had made shift to spit a great turkey
sent me this week from Charles Carter, my old colleague, now minister in
Huntingdonshire, but not at all roasted, and so I was fain to stay till
two o’clock, and after that to church with my wife, and a good sermon
there was, and so home. All the evening at my book, and so to supper and
to bed.
