25th (Lord’s day). Up, and to my Office awhile, and thither comes Lead
with my vizard, with a tube fastened within both eyes; which, with
the help which he prompts me to, of a glass in the tube, do content
me mightily. So to church, where a stranger made a dull sermon, but I
mightily pleased to looks upon Mr. Buckworth’s little pretty daughters,
and so home to, dinner, where W. Howe come and dined with us; and then
I to my Office, he being gone, to write down my journal for the last
twelve days: and did it with the help of my vizard and tube fixed to it,
and do find it mighty manageable, but how helpfull to my eyes this trial
will shew me. So abroad with my wife, in the afternoon, to the Park,
where very much company, and the weather very pleasant. I carried my
wife to the Lodge, the first time this year, and there in our coach eat
a cheese-cake and drank a tankard of milk. I showed her this day also
first the Prince of Tuscany, who was in the Park, and many very fine
ladies, and so home, and after supper to bed.
