28th (Lord’s day). Up the first time I have had great while. Home to
dined, and with my boy alone to church anybody to attend me to church a
dinner, and there met Creed, who, and we merry together, as his learning
is such and judgment that I cannot but be pleased with it. After dinner
I took him to church, into our gallery, with me, but slept the best part
of the sermon, which was a most silly one. So he and I to walk to the
‘Change a while, talking from one pleasant discourse to another, and
so home, and thither came my uncle Wight and aunt, and supped with us
mighty merry. And Creed lay with us all night, and so to bed, very merry
to think how Mr. Holliard (who came in this evening to see me) makes
nothing, but proving as a most clear thing that Rome is Antichrist.
