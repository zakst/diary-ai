5th (Lord’s day). About four in the morning took four pills of Dr.
Turberville’s prescribing, for my eyes, and they wrought pretty well
most of the morning, and I did get my wife to spend the morning reading
of Wilkins’s Reall Character. At noon comes W. Hewer and Pelling, and
young Michell and his wife, and dined with us, and most of the afternoon
talking; and then at night my wife to read again, and to supper and to
bed.
