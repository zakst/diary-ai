2nd (Sunday). Up, and all the morning dressing my closet at the office
with my plates, very neatly, and a fine place now it is, and will be
a pleasure to sit in, though I thank God I needed none before. At noon
dined at home, and after dinner to my accounts and cast them up, and
find that though I have spent above L90 this month yet I have saved L17,
and am worth in all above L1450, for which the Lord be praised! In the
evening my Lady Pen and daughter come to see, and supped with us, then a
messenger about business of the office from Sir G. Carteret at Chatham,
and by word of mouth did send me word that the business between my Lord
and him is fully agreed on,

     [The arrangements for the marriage of Lady Jemimah Montagu to Philip
     Carteret were soon settled, for the wedding took place on July 31st]

and is mightily liked of by the King and the Duke of Yorke, and that
he sent me this word with great joy; they gone, we to bed. I hear this
night that Sir J. Lawson was buried late last night at St. Dunstanâ€™s by
us, without any company at all, and that the condition of his family
is but very poor, which I could be contented to be sorry for, though he
never was the man that ever obliged me by word or deed.
