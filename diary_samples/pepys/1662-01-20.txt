20th. This morning Sir Win. Batten and Pen and I did begin the examining
the Treasurer’s accounts, the first time ever he had passed in the
office, which is very long, and we were all at it till noon, and then
to dinner, he providing a fine dinner for us, and we eat it at Sir W.
Batten’s, where we were very merry, there being at table the Treasurer
and we three, Mr. Wayth, Ferrer, Smith, Turner, and Mr. Morrice, the
wine cooper, who this day did divide the two butts, which we four did
send for, of sherry from Cales, and mine was put into a hogshead, and
the vessel filled up with four gallons of Malaga wine, but what it will
stand us in I know not: but it is the first great quantity of wine that
I ever bought. And after dinner to the office all the afternoon till
late at night, and then home, where my aunt and uncle Wight and Mrs.
Anne Wight came to play at cards (at gleek which she taught me and my
wife last week) and so to supper, and then to cards and so good night.
Then I to my practice of musique and then at 12 o’clock to bed. This day
the workmen began to make me a sellar door out of the back yard, which
will much please me.
