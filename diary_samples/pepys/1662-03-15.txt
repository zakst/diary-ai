15th. With Sir G. Carteret and both the Sir Williams at Whitehall to
wait on the Duke in his chamber, which we did about getting money for
the Navy and other things. So back again to the office all the morning.
Thence to the Exchange to hire a ship for the Maderas, but could get
none. Then home to dinner, and Sir G. Carteret and I all the afternoon
by ourselves upon business in the office till late at night. So to write
letters and home to bed. Troubled at my maidâ€™s being ill.
