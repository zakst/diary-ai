5th: Up among my workmen and so to the office, and then to Sir W. Pen’s
with the other Sir William and Sir John Lawson to dinner, and after
that, with them to Mr. Lucy’s, a merchant, where much good company, and
there drank a great deal of wine, and in discourse fell to talk of
the weight of people, which did occasion some wagers, and where, among
others, I won half a piece to be spent. Then home, and at night to Sir
W. Batten’s, and there very merry with a good barrell of oysters, and
this is the present life I lead. Home and to bed.
