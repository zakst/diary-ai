16th. Up, and to several places, to pay what I owed. Among others, to
my mercer, to pay for my fine camlott cloak, which costs me, the very
stuff, almost L6; and also a velvet coat-the outside cost me above
L8. And so to Westminster, where I find the House mighty busy upon a
petition against my Lord Gerard, which lays heavy things to his charge,
of his abusing the King in his Guards; and very hot the House is upon
it. I away home to dinner alone with wife and girle, and so to the
office, where mighty busy to my great content late, and then home to
supper, talk with my wife, and to bed. It was doubtful to-day whether
the House should be adjourned to-morrow or no.
