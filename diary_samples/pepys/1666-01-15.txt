15th. Busy all the morning in my chamber in my old cloth suit, while my
usuall one is to my taylor’s to mend, which I had at noon again, and an
answer to a letter I had sent this morning to Mrs. Pierce to go along
with my wife and I down to Greenwich to-night upon an invitation to Mr.
Boreman’s to be merry to dance and sing with Mrs. Knipp. Being dressed,
and having dined, I took coach and to Mrs. Pierce, to her new house in
Covent-Garden, a very fine place and fine house. Took her thence home
to my house, and so by water to Boreman’s by night, where the greatest
disappointment that ever I saw in my life, much company, a good supper
provided, and all come with expectation of excesse of mirthe, but
all blank through the waywardnesse of Mrs. Knipp, who, though she
had appointed the night, could not be got to come. Not so much as her
husband could get her to come; but, which was a pleasant thing in all my
anger, I asking him, while we were in expectation what answer one of our
many messengers would bring, what he thought, whether she would come or
no, he answered that, for his part, he could not so much as thinke. By
and by we all to supper, which the silly master of the feast commended,
but, what with my being out of humour, and the badnesse of the meate
dressed, I did never eat a worse supper in my life. At last, very late,
and supper done, she came undressed, but it brought me no mirthe at
all; only, after all being done, without singing, or very little, and no
dancing, Pierce and I to bed together, and he and I very merry to find
how little and thin clothes they give us to cover us, so that we were
fain to lie in our stockings and drawers, and lay all our coates and
clothes upon the bed. So to sleep.
