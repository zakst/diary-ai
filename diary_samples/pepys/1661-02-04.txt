4th. Early up to Court with Sir W. Pen, where, at Mr. Coventry’s
chamber, we met with all our fellow officers, and there after a hot
debate about the business of paying off the Fleet, and how far we
should join with the Commissioners of Parliament, which is now the great
business of this month more to determine, and about which there is
a great deal of difference between us, and then how far we should be
assistants to them therein. That being done, he and I back again home,
where I met with my father and mother going to my cozen Snow’s to
Blackwall, and had promised to bring me and my wife along with them,
which we could not do because we are to go to the Dolphin to-day to a
dinner of Capt. Tayler’s. So at last I let my wife go with them, and
I to the tavern, where Sir William Pen and the Comptroller and several
others were, men and women; and we had a very great and merry dinner;
and after dinner the Comptroller begun some sports, among others the
naming of people round and afterwards demanding questions of them that
they are forced to answer their names to, which do make very good sport.
And here I took pleasure to take the forfeits of the ladies who would
not do their duty by kissing of them; among others a pretty lady, who I
found afterwards to be wife to Sir W. Batten’s son. Home, and then with
my wife to see Sir W. Batten, who could not be with us this day being
ill, but we found him at cards, and here we sat late, talking with my
Lady and others and Dr. Whistler,
