19th. Slept till 8 o’clock, and then up and met with letters from the
King and Lord Arlington, for the removal of our office to Greenwich. I
also wrote letters, and made myself ready to go to Sir G. Carteret, at
Windsor; and having borrowed a horse of Mr. Blackbrough, sent him to
wait for me at the Duke of Albemarle’s door: when, on a sudden, a letter
comes to us from the Duke of Albemarle, to tell us that the fleete is
all come back to Solebay, and are presently to be dispatched back again.
Whereupon I presently by water to the Duke of Albemarle to know what
news; and there I saw a letter from my Lord Sandwich to the Duke of
Albemarle, and also from Sir W. Coventry and Captain Teddiman; how my
Lord having commanded Teddiman with twenty-two ships

     [A news letter of August 19th (Salisbury), gives the following
     account of this affair:--“The Earl of Sandwich being on the Norway
     coast, ordered Sir Thomas Teddeman with 20 ships to attack 50 Dutch
     merchant ships in Bergen harbour; six convoyers had so placed
     themselves that only four or five of the ships could be reached at
     once.  The Governor of Bergen fired on our ships, and placed 100
     pieces of ordnance and two regiments of foot on the rocks to attack
     them, but they got clear without the loss of a ship, only 500 men
     killed or wounded, five or six captains among them. The fleet has
     gone to Sole Bay to repair losses and be ready to encounter the
     Dutch fleet, which is gone northward” (“Calendar of State Papers,”
