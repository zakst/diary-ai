5th. Home all the morning. Several people came to me about business,
among others the great Tom Fuller, who came to desire a kindness for
a friend of his, who hath a mind to go to Jamaica with these two ships
that are going, which I promised to do. So to Whitehall to my Lady, whom
I found at dinner and dined with her, and staid with her talking all
the afternoon, and thence walked to Westminster Hall. So to Will’s, and
drank with Spicer, and thence by coach home, staying a little in Paul’s
Churchyard, to bespeak Ogilby’s AEsop’s Fables and Tully’s Officys to be
bound for me. So home and to bed.
