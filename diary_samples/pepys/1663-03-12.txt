12th. Up betimes and to my office all the morning with Captain Cocke
ending their account of their Riga contract for hemp. So home to dinner,
my head full of business against the office. After dinner comes my uncle
Thomas with a letter to my father, wherein, as we desire, he and his son
do order their tenants to pay their rents to us, which pleases me well.
In discourse he tells me my uncle Wight thinks much that I do never see
them, and they have reason, but I do apprehend that they have been too
far concerned with my uncle Thomas against us, so that I have had no
mind hitherto, but now I shall go see them. He being gone, I to the
office, where at the choice of maisters and chyrurgeons for the fleet
now going out, I did my business as I could wish, both for the persons
I had a mind to serve, and in getting the warrants signed drawn by my
clerks, which I was afeard of. Sat late, and having done I went home,
where I found Mary Ashwell come to live with us, of whom I hope well,
and pray God she may please us, which, though it cost me something,
yet will give me much content. So to supper and to bed, and find by her
discourse and carriage to-night that she is not proud, but will do
what she is bid, but for want of being abroad knows not how to give the
respect to her mistress, as she will do when she is told it, she having
been used only to little children, and there was a kind of a mistress
over them. Troubled all night with my cold, I being quite hoarse with it
that I could not speak to be heard at all almost.
