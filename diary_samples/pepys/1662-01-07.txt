7th. Long in bed, and then rose and went along with Sir W. Pen on foot
to Stepny to Mrs. Chappell’s (who has the pretty boy to her son), and
there met my wife and Sir W. Pen’s children all, and Mrs. Poole and her
boy, and there dined and’ were very merry, and home again by coach and
so to the office. In the afternoon and at night to Sir W. Pen’s, there
supped and played at cards with them and were merry, the children being
to go all away to school again to-morrow. Thence home and to bed.
