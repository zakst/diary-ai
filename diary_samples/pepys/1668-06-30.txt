30th. Up, and at the Office all the morning: then home to dinner, where
a stinking leg of mutton, the weather being very wet and hot to keep
meat in. Then to the Office again, all the afternoon: we met about the
Victuallerâ€™s new contract. And so up, and to walk all the evening with
my wife and Mrs. Turner in the garden, till supper, about eleven at
night; and so, after supper, parted, and to bed, my eyes bad, but not
worse, only weary with working. But, however, I very melancholy under
the fear of my eyes being spoiled, and not to be recovered; for I am
come that I am not able to readout a small letter, and yet my sight good
for the little while I can read, as ever they were, I think.
