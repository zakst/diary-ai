30th. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning, and at noon
home to dinner, and then to the office again, where late, very busy,
and dispatching much business. Mr. Hater staying most of the afternoon
abroad, he come to me, poor man, to make excuse, and it was that he had
been looking out for a little house for his family. His wife being much
frightened in the country with the discourses of troubles and disorders
like to be, and therefore durst not be from him, and therefore he is
forced to bring her to towne that they may be together. This is now the
general apprehension of all people; particulars I do not know, but my
owne fears are also great, and I do think it time to look out to save
something, if a storm should come. At night home to supper, and singing
with my wife, who hath lately begun to learn, and I think will come
to do something, though her eare is not good, nor I, I confess, have
patience enough to teach her, or hear her sing now and then a note out
of tune, and am to blame that I cannot bear with that in her which is
fit I should do with her as a learner, and one that I desire much could
sing, and so should encourage her. This I was troubled at, for I do find
that I do put her out of heart, and make her fearfull to sing before me.
So after supper to bed.
