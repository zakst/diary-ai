13th. Up, and to my office, and thence by water to White Hall to attend
the Council, but did not, and so home to dinner, and so out with my
wife, and Deb., and W. Hewer towards Cooper’s, but I ‘light and walked
to Ducke Lane, and there to the bookseller’s; at the Bible, whose moher
je have a mind to, but elle no erat dentro, but I did there look upon
and buy some books, and made way for coming again to the man, which
pleases me. Thence to Reeves’s, and there saw some, and bespoke a little
perspective, and was mightily pleased with seeing objects in a dark
room. And so to Cooper’s, and spent the afternoon with them; and it will
be an excellent picture. Thence my people all by water to Deptford, to
see Balty, while I to buy my espinette,

     [Espinette is the French term for a small harpsichord, at that time
     called in England a spinet.  It was named from a fancied resemblance
     of its quill plectra to spines or thorns.]

which I did now agree for, and did at Haward’s meet with Mr. Thacker,
and heard him play on the harpsicon, so as I never heard man before,
I think. So home, it being almost night, and there find in the garden
Pelling, who hath brought Tempest, Wallington, and Pelham, to sings and
there had most excellent musick late, in the dark, with great pleasure.
Made them drink and eat; and so with much pleasure to bed, but above
all with little Wallington. This morning I was let blood, and did bleed
about fourteen ounces, towards curing my eyes.
