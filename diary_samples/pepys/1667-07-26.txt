26th. Up, and betimes to the office, where Mr. Hater and I together all
the morning about the perfecting of my abstract book of contracts and
other things to my great content. At noon home to dinner, and then to
the office again all the afternoon doing of other good things there,
and being tired, I then abroad with my wife and left her at the New
Exchange, while I by water thence to Westminster to the Hall, but shops
were shut up, and so to White Hall by water, and thence took up my wife
at Unthankeâ€™s, and so home, mightily tired with the dust in riding in a
coach, it being mighty troublesome. So home and to my office, and there
busy very late, and then to walk a little with my wife, and then to
supper and to bed. No news at all this day what we have done to the
enemy, but that the enemy is fallen down, and we after them, but to
little purpose.
