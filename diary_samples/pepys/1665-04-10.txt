10s., which is very much, and I do much value myself upon the account,
and herein I with great joy find myself to have gained this month above
L100 clear, and in the whole to be worth above L1400, the greatest sum I
ever yet was worth. Thence home to dinner, and there find poor Mr. Spong
walking at my door, where he had knocked, and being told I was at the
office staid modestly there walking because of disturbing me, which
methinks was one of the most modest acts (of a man that hath no need of
being so to me) that ever I knew in my life. He dined with me, and then
after dinner to my closet, where abundance of mighty pretty discourse,
wherein, in a word, I find him the man of the world that hath of his own
ingenuity obtained the most in most things, being withall no scholler.
He gone, I took boat and down to Woolwich and Deptford, and made it
late home, and so to supper and to bed. Thus I end this month in great
content as to my estate and gettings: in much trouble as to the pains I
have taken, and the rubs I expect yet to meet with, about the business
of Tangier. The fleete, with about 106 ships upon the coast of Holland,
in sight of the Dutch, within the Texel. Great fears of the sickenesse
here in the City, it being said that two or three houses are already
shut up. God preserve as all!
