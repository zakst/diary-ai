10th. Up, and entered all my Journall since the 28th of October, having
every day’s passages well in my head, though it troubles me to remember
it, and which I was forced to, being kept from my lodging, where my
books and papers are, for several days. So to my office, where till two
or three o’clock busy before I could go to my lodging to dinner, then
did it and to my office again. In the evening newes is brought me my
wife is come: so I to her, and with her spent the evening, but with
no great pleasure, I being vexed about her putting away of Mary in my
absence, but yet I took no notice of it at all, but fell into other
discourse, and she told me, having herself been this day at my house
at London, which was boldly done, to see Mary have her things, that Mr.
Harrington, our neighbour, an East country merchant, is dead at Epsum of
the plague, and that another neighbour of ours, Mr. Hollworthy, a very
able man, is also dead by a fall in the country from his horse, his foot
hanging in the stirrup, and his brains beat out. Here we sat talking,
and after supper to bed.
