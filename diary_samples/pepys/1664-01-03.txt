3rd (Lordâ€™s day). Lay long in bed, and then rose and with a fire in my
chamber staid within all day, looking over and settling my accounts in
good order, by examining all my books, and the kitchen books, and I find
that though the proper profit of my last year was but L305, yet I did by
other gain make it up L444., which in every part of it was unforeseen
of me, and therefore it was a strange oversight for lack of examining my
expenses that I should spend L690 this year, but for the time to come
I have so distinctly settled all my accounts in writing and the
particulars of all my several layings out, that I do hope I shall
hereafter make a better judgment of my spendings than ever. I dined with
my wife in her chamber, she in bed, and then down again and till 11 at
night, and broke up and to bed with great content, but could not make
an end of writing over my vows as I purposed, but I am agreed in every
thing how to order myself for the year to come, which I trust in God
will be much for my good. So up to prayers and to bed. This evening Sir
W. Pen came to invite me against next Wednesday, being Twelfth day, to
his usual feast, his wedding day.
