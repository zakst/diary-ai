2nd (Lord’s day). Up betimes, and down to my chamber without trimming
myself, or putting on clean linen, thinking only to keep to my chamber
and do business to-day, but when I come there I find that without being
shaved I am not fully awake, nor ready to settle to business, and so
was fain to go up again and dress myself, which I did, and so down to
my chamber, and fell roundly to business, and did to my satisfaction by
dinner go far in the drawing up a state of my accounts of Tangier for
the new Lords Commissioners. So to dinner, and then to my business again
all the afternoon close, when Creed come to visit me, but I did put him
off, and to my business, till anon I did make an end, and wrote it fair
with a letter to the Lords to accompany my accounts, which I think will
be so much satisfaction and so soon done (their order for my doing it
being dated but May 30) as they will not find from any hand else. Being
weary and almost blind with writing and reading so much to-day, I took
boat at the Old Swan, and there up the river all alone as high as Putney
almost, and then back again, all the way reading, and finishing Mr.
Boyle’s book of Colours, which is so chymical, that I can understand but
little of it, but understand enough to see that he is a most excellent
man. So back and home, and there to supper, and so to bed.
