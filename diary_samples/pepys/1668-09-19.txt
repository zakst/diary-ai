19th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning busy, and so dined
with my people at home, and then to the King’s playhouse, and there saw
“The Silent Woman;” the best comedy, I think, that ever was wrote; and
sitting by Shadwell the poet, he was big with admiration of it. Here was
my Lord Brouncker and W. Pen and their ladies in the box, being grown
mighty kind of a sudden; but, God knows, it will last but a little
while, I dare swear. Knepp did her part mighty well. And so home
straight, and to work, and particularly to my cozen Roger, who, W.
Hewer and my wife writes me, do use them with mighty plenty and noble
entertainment: so home to supper, and to bed. All the news now is, that
Mr. Trevor is for certain now to be Secretary, in Morrice’s place, which
the Duke of York did himself tell me yesterday; and also that Parliament
is to be adjourned to the 1st of March, which do please me well, hoping
thereby to get my things in a little better order than I should have
done; and the less attendances at that end of the town in winter. So
home to supper and to bed.
