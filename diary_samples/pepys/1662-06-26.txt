26th. Up and took physique, but such as to go abroad with, only to
loosen me, for I am bound. So to the office, and there all the morning
sitting till noon, and then took Commissioner Pett home to dinner with
me, where my stomach was turned when my sturgeon came to table, upon
which I saw very many little worms creeping, which I suppose was through
the staleness of the pickle. He being gone, comes Mr. Nicholson, my old
fellow-student at Magdalene, and we played three or four things upon
the violin and basse, and so parted, and I to my office till night, and
there came Mr. Shepley and Creed in order to settling some accounts of
my Lord to-night, and so to bed.
