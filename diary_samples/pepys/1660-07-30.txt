30th. Sat at our office to-day, and my father came this day the first
time to see us at my new office. And Mrs. Crisp by chance came in and
sat with us, looked over our house and advised about the furnishing of
it. This afternoon I got my L50, due to me for my first quarter’s salary
as Secretary to my Lord, paid to Tho. Hater for me, which he received
and brought home to me, of which I am full glad. To Westminster and
among other things met with Mr. Moore, and took him and his friend, a
bookseller of Paul’s Churchyard, to the Rhenish Winehouse, and drinking
there the sword-bearer of London (Mr. Man) came to ask for us, with whom
we sat late, discoursing about the worth of my office of Clerk of the
Acts, which he hath a mind to buy, and I asked four years’ purchase. We
are to speak more of it to-morrow. Home on foot, and seeing him at home
at Butler’s merry, he lent me a torch, which Will carried, and so home.
