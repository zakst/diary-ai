23rd (Lord’s day). Up and alone to church, and meeting Nan Wright at the
gate had opportunity to take two or three ‘baisers’, and so to church,
where a vain fellow with a periwigg preached, Chaplain, as by his prayer
appeared, to the Earl of Carlisle? Home, and there dined with us Betty
Michell and her husband. After dinner to White Hall by coach, and took
them with me. And in the way I would have taken ‘su main’ as I did the
last time, but she did in a manner withhold it. So set them down at
White Hall, and I to the Chapel to find Dr. Gibbons, and from him to the
Harp and Ball to transcribe the treble which I would have him to set
a bass to. But this took me so much time, and it growing night, I was
fearful of missing a coach, and therefore took a coach and to rights
to call Michell and his wife at their father Howlett’s, and so home, it
being cold, and the ground all snow.... They gone I to my chamber, and
with my brother and wife did number all my books in my closet, and took
a list of their names, which pleases me mightily, and is a jobb I wanted
much to have done. Then to supper and to bed.
