11th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and by water to White Hall, there met Mr.
Coventry coming out, going along with the Commissioners of the Ordnance
to the water side to take barge, they being to go down to the Hope. I
returned with them as far as the Tower in their barge speaking with Sir
W. Coventry and so home and to church, and at noon dined and then to
my chamber, where with great pleasure about one business or other till
late, and so to supper and to bed.
