25th. All the morning at the office. At noon home and eat a bit myself,
and then followed my wife and girls to the Duke of York’s house, and
there before one, but the house infinite full, where, by and by, the
King and Court come, it being a new play, or an old one new vamped, by
Shadwell, called “The Royall Shepherdesse;” but the silliest for words
and design, and everything, that ever I saw in my whole life, there
being nothing in the world pleasing in it, but a good martial dance of
pikemen, where Harris and another do handle their pikes in a dance to
admiration; but never less satisfied with a play in my life. Thence to
the office I, and did a little business, and so home to supper with my
girls, and pretty merry, only my eyes, which continue very bad, and my
cold, that I cannot speak at all, do trouble me.
