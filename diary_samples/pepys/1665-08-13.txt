13th (Lord’s day). Up betimes and to my chamber, it being a very wet
day all day, and glad am I that we did not go by water to see “The
Soveraigne”

     [“The Sovereign of the Seas” was built at Woolwich in 1637 of timber
     which had been stripped of its bark while growing in the spring, and
     not felled till the second autumn afterwards; and it is observed by
     Dr. Plot (“Phil.  Trans.”  for 1691), in his discourse on the most
     seasonable time for felling timber, written by the advice of Pepys,
     that after forty-seven years, “all the ancient timber then remaining
     in her, it was no easy matter to drive a nail into it” (“Quarterly
     Review,” vol. viii., p. 35).--B.]

to-day, as I intended, clearing all matters in packing up my papers
and books, and giving instructions in writing to my executors, thereby
perfecting the whole business of my will, to my very great joy; so that
I shall be in much better state of soul, I hope, if it should please
the Lord to call me away this sickly time. At night to read, being
weary with this day’s great work, and then after supper to bed, to rise
betimes to-morrow, and to bed with a mind as free as to the business of
the world as if I were not worth L100 in the whole world, every thing
being evened under my hand in my books and papers, and upon the whole I
find myself worth, besides Brampton estate, the sum of L2164, for which
the Lord be praised!
