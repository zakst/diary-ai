20th. Up before day, and wrote some letters to go to my Lord, among
others that about W. Howe, which I believe will turn him out, and so
took horse for Nonesuch, with two men with me, and the ways very bad,
and the weather worse, for wind and rayne. But we got in good time
thither, and I did get my tallys got ready, and thence, with as many as
could go, to Yowell, and there dined very well, and I saw my Besse, a
very well-favoured country lass there, and after being very merry and
having spent a piece I took horse, and by another way met with a very
good road, but it rained hard and blew, but got home very well. Here
I find Mr. Deering come to trouble me about business, which I soon
dispatched and parted, he telling me that Luellin hath been dead this
fortnight, of the plague, in St. Martinâ€™s Lane, which much surprised me.
