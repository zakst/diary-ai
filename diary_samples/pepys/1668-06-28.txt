28th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and to church, and then home to dinner, where
Betty Turner, Mercer, and Captain Deane, and after dinner to sing, Mr.
Pelting coming. Then, they gone, Deane and I all the afternoon till
night to talk of navy matters and ships with great pleasure, and so at
night, he gone, I to supper, Pelling coming again and singing a while,
then to bed. Much talk of the French setting out their fleete afresh;
but I hear nothing that our King is alarmed at it, at all, but rather
making his fleete less.
