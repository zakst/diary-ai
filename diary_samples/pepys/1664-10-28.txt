28th. Slept ill all night, having got a very great cold the other day at
Woolwich in [my] head, which makes me full of snot. Up in the morning,
and my tailor brings me home my fine, new, coloured cloth suit, my
cloake lined with plush, as good a suit as ever I wore in my life,
and mighty neat, to my great content. To my office, and there all
the morning. At noon to Nellson’s, and there bought 20 pieces more of
Bewpers, and hope to go on with him to a contract. Thence to the ‘Change
a little, and thence home with Luellin to dinner, where Mr. Deane met
me by appointment, and after dinner he and I up to my chamber, and
there hard at discourse, and advising him what to do in his business at
Harwich, and then to discourse of our old business of ships and taking
new rules of him to my great pleasure, and he being gone I to my office
a little, and then to see Sir W. Batten, who is sick of a greater cold
than I, and thither comes to me Mr. Holliard, and into the chamber to
me, and, poor man (beyond all I ever saw of him), was a little drunk,
and there sat talking and finding acquaintance with Sir W. Batten and my
Lady by relations on both sides, that there we staid very long. At last
broke up, and he home much overcome with drink, but well enough to get
well home. So I home to supper and to bed.
