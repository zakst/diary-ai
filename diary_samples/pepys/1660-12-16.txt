16th. In the morning to church, and then dined at home. In the afternoon
I to White Hall, where I was surprised with the news of a plot against
the King’s person and my Lord Monk’s; and that since last night there
are about forty taken up on suspicion; and, amongst others, it was my
lot to meet with Simon Beale, the Trumpeter, who took me and Tom Doling
into the Guard in Scotland Yard, and showed us Major-General Overton,
where I heard him deny that he is guilty of any such things; but that
whereas it is said that he is found to have brought many arms to town,
he says it is only to sell them, as he will prove by oath. From thence
with Tom Doling and Boston and D. Vines (whom we met by the way) to
Price’s, and there we drank, and in discourse I learnt a pretty trick to
try whether a woman be a maid or no, by a string going round her head to
meet at the end of her nose, which if she be not will come a great way
beyond. Thence to my Lady’s and staid with her an hour or two talking of
the Duke of York and his lady, the Chancellor’s daughter, between whom,
she tells me, that all is agreed and he will marry her. But I know not
how true yet. It rained hard, and my Lady would have had me have the
coach, but I would not, but to my father’s, where I met my wife, and
there supped, and after supper by link home and to bed.
