3rd. Up betimes to work again, and then met at the Office, where to
our great business of this answer to the Parliament; where to my great
vexation I find my Lord Brouncker prepared only to excuse himself, while
I, that have least reason to trouble myself, am preparing with great
pains to defend them all: and more, I perceive, he would lodge the
beginning of discharging ships by ticket upon me; but I care not, for
I believe I shall get more honour by it when the Parliament, against my
will, shall see how the whole business of the Office was done by me. At
noon rose and to dinner. My wife abroad with Mercer and Deb. buying of
things, but I with my clerks home to dinner, and thence presently down
with Lord Brouncker, W. Pen, T. Harvy, T. Middleton, and Mr. Tippets,
who first took his place this day at the table, as a Commissioner, in
the room of Commissioner Pett. Down by water to Deptford, where the
King, Queene, and Court are to see launched the new ship built by Mr.
Shish, called “The Charles.” 2 God send her better luck than the former!
Here some of our brethren, who went in a boat a little before my boat,
did by appointment take opportunity of asking the King’s leave that
we might make full use of the want of money, in our excuse to the
Parliament for the business of tickets, and other things they will lay
to our charge, all which arose from nothing else: and this the King did
readily agree to, and did give us leave to make our full use of it.
The ship being well launched, I back again by boat, setting [Sir] T.
Middleton and Mr. Tippets on shore at Ratcliffe, I home and there to my
chamber with Mr. Gibson, and late up till midnight preparing more things
against our defence on Thursday next to my content, though vexed that
all this trouble should be on me. So to supper and to bed.
