I find by Hayes that they did expect great glory in coming home in so
good condition as they did with the fleete, and therefore I the less
wonder that the Prince was distasted with my discourse the other day
about the bad state of the fleete. But it pleases me to hear that he did
expect great thanks, and lays the fault of the want of it upon the fire,
which deadened everything, and the glory of his services. About seven at
night home, and called my wife, and, it being moonshine, took her into
the garden, and there layed open our condition as to our estate, and the
danger of my having it [his money] all in the house at once, in case of
any disorder or troubles in the State, and therefore resolved to remove
part of it to Brampton, and part some whither else, and part in my owne
house, which is very necessary, and will tend to our safety, though I
shall not think it safe out of my owne sight. So to the office, and then
to supper and to bed.
