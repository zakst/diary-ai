18th (Lord’s day). Up and to church all of us. At noon comes Anthony
and W. Joyce (their wives being in the country with my father) and dined
with me very merry as I can be in such company. After dinner walked
to Westminster (tiring them by the way, and so left them, Anthony
in Cheapside and the other in the Strand), and there spent all the
afternoon in the Cloysters as I had agreed with Jane Welsh, but she came
not, which vexed me, staying till 5 o’clock, and then walked homeward,
and by coach to the old Exchange, and thence to my aunt Wight’s, and
invited her and my uncle to supper, and so home, and by and by they
came, and we eat a brave barrel of oysters Mr. Povy sent me this
morning, and very merry at supper, and so to prayers and to bed. Last
night it seems my aunt Wight did send my wife a new scarfe, laced, as a
token for her many givings to her. It is true now and then we give them
some toys, as oranges, &c., but my aime is to get myself something more
from my uncle’s favour than this.
