11th inst., as related by Rugge:--“That about eight of the clock at
     night he escaped by a rope tied fast to his window, by which he slid
     down, and in each hand he had a handkerchief; and six men were ready
     to receive him, who had a barge to hasten him away.  She who made
     the bed, being privy to his escape, that night, to blind the warder
     when he came to lock the chamber-door, went to bed, and possessed
     Colonel Lambert’s place, and put on his night-cap.  So, when the
     said warder came to lock the door, according to his usual manner, he
     found the curtains drawn, and conceiving it to be Colonel John
     Lambert, he said, ‘Good night, my Lord.’  To which a seeming voice
     replied, and prevented all further jealousies.  The next morning, on
     coming to unlock the door, and espying her face, he cried out, ‘In
     the name of God, Joan, what makes you here?  Where is my Lord
     Lambert?’  She said, ‘He is gone; but I cannot tell whither.’
     Whereupon he caused her to rise, and carried her before the officer
     in the Tower, and [she] was committed to custody.  Some said that a
     lady knit for him a garter of silk, by which he was conveyed down,
     and that she received L100 for her pains.”--B]

My Lord is chosen at Waymouth this morning; my Lord had his freedom
brought him by Captain Tiddiman of the port of Dover, by which he is
capable of being elected for them. This day I heard that the Army had in
general declared to stand by what the next Parliament shall do. At night
supped with my Lord.
