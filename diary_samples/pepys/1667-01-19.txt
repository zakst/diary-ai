19th. Up, and at the office all the morning. Sir W. Batten tells me to
my wonder that at his coming to my Lord Ashly, yesterday morning, to
tell him what prize-goods he would have saved for the Navy, and not
sold, according to the King’s order on the 17th, he fell quite out with
him in high terms; and he says, too, that they did go on to the sale
yesterday, even of the very hempe, and other things, at which I am
astonished, and will never wonder at the ruine of the King’s affairs, if
this be suffered. At noon dined, and Mr. Pierce come to see me, he newly
come from keeping his Christmas in the country. So to the office, where
very busy, but with great pleasure till late at night, and then home to
supper and to bed.
