11th. Musique, then my brother Tom came, and spoke to him about selling
of Sturtlow, he consents to, and I think will be the best for him,
considering that he needs money, and has no mind to marry. Dined at
home, and at the office in the afternoon. So home to musique, my mind
being full of our alteracons in the garden, and my getting of things
in the office settled to the advantage of my clerks, which I found Mr.
Turner much troubled at, and myself am not quiet in mind. But I hope by
degrees to bring it to it. At night begun to compose songs, and begin
with “Gaze not on Swans.” So to bed.
