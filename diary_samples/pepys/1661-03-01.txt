March 1st. All the morning at the office. Dined at home only upon fish,
and Mr. Shepley and Tom Hater with me. After dinner Mr. Shepley and I
in private talking about my Lord’s intentions to go speedily into the
country, but to what end we know not. We fear he is to go to sea with
this fleet now preparing. But we wish that he could get his L4000 per
annum settled before he do go. Then he and I walked into London, he
to the Wardrobe and I to Whitefryars, and saw “The Bondman” acted; an
excellent play and well done. But above all that ever I saw, Betterton
do the Bond man the best. Then to my father’s and found my mother ill.
After staying a while with them, I went home and sat up late, spending
my thoughts how to get money to bear me out in my great expense at the
Coronacion, against which all provide, and scaffolds setting up in every
street. I had many designs in my head to get some, but know not which
will take. To bed.
