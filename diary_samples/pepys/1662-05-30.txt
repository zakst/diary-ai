30th. This morning I made up my accounts, and find myself ‘de claro’
worth about L530, and no more, so little have I increased it since my
last reckoning; but I confess I have laid out much money in clothes.
Upon a suddaine motion I took my wife, and Sarah and Will by water, with
some victuals with us, as low as Gravesend, intending to have gone into
the Hope to the Royal James, to have seen the ship and Mr. Shepley, but
meeting Mr. Shepley in a hoy, bringing up my Lord’s things, she and I
went on board, and sailed up with them as far as half-way tree, very
glad to see Mr. Shepley. Here we saw a little Turk and a negroe, which
are intended for pages to the two young ladies. Many birds and other
pretty noveltys there was, but I was afeard of being louzy, and so
took boat again, and got to London before them, all the way, coming and
going, reading in the “Wallflower” with great pleasure. So home, and
thence to the Wardrobe, where Mr. Shepley was come with the things.
Here I staid talking with my Lady, who is preparing to go to-morrow to
Hampton Court. So home, and at ten o’clock at night Mr. Shepley came to
sup with me. So we had a dish of mackerell and pease, and so he bid us
good night, going to lie on board the hoy, and I to bed.
