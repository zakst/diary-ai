July 1st. This morning came home my fine Camlett cloak,

     [Camlet was a mixed stuff of wool and silk.  It was very expensive,
     and later Pepys gave L24 for a suit.  (See June 1st, 1664.)]

with gold buttons, and a silk suit, which cost me much money, and I pray
God to make me able to pay for it. I went to the cook’s and got a good
joint of meat, and my wife and I dined at home alone. In the afternoon
to the Abbey, where a good sermon by a stranger, but no Common Prayer
yet. After sermon called in at Mrs. Crisp’s, where I saw Mynheer Roder,
that is to marry Sam Hartlib’s sister, a great fortune for her to
light on, she being worth nothing in the world. Here I also saw Mrs.
Greenlife, who is come again to live in Axe Yard with her new husband
Mr. Adams. Then to my Lord’s, where I staid a while. So to see for Mr.
Creed to speak about getting a copy of Barlow’s patent. To my Lord’s,
where late at night comes Mr. Morland, whom I left prating with my Lord,
and so home.
