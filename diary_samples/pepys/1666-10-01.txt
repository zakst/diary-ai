October 1st, 1666. Up, and all the morning at the office, getting
the list of all the ships and vessels employed since the war, for the
Committee of Parliament. At noon with it to Sir W. Coventry’s chamber,
and there dined with him and [Sir] W. Batten, and [Sir] W. Pen, and
after dinner examined it and find it will do us much right in the number
of men rising to near the expense we delivered to the Parliament.
[Sir] W. Coventry and I (the others going before the Committee) to Lord
Bruncker’s for his hand, and find him simply mighty busy in a council of
the Queen’s. He come out and took in the papers to sign, and sent them
mighty wisely out again. Sir W. Coventry away to the Committee, and I to
the Mercer’s, and there took a bill of what I owe of late, which comes
to about L17. Thence to White Hall, and there did hear Betty Michell
was at this end of the towne, and so without breach of vowe did stay to
endeavour to meet with her and carry her home; but she did not come, so
I lost my whole afternoon. But pretty! how I took another pretty woman
for her, taking her a clap on the breech, thinking verily it had been
her. Staid till [Sir] W. Batten and [Sir] W. Pen come out, and so away
home by water with them, and to the office to do some business, and then
home, and my wife do tell me that W. Hewer tells her that Mercer hath
no mind to come. So I was angry at it, and resolved with her to have
Falconbridge’s girle, and I think it will be better for us, and will
please me better with singing. With this resolution, to supper and to
bed.
