9th. Up and to my office all the morning, and there saw several things
done in my work to my great content, and at noon home to dinner, and
after dinner in Sir W. Pen’s coach he set my wife and I down at the New
Exchange, and after buying some things we walked to my Lady Sandwich’s,
who, good lady, is now, thanks be to God! so well as to sit up, and sent
to us, if we were not afeard, to come up to her. So we did; but she was
mightily against my wife’s coming so near her; though, poor wretch! she
is as well as ever she was, as to the meazles, and nothing can I see
upon her face. There we sat talking with her above three hours, till six
o’clock, of several things with great pleasure and so away, and home
by coach, buying several things for my wife in our way, and so after
looking what had been done in my office to-day, with good content home
to supper and to bed. But, strange, how I cannot get any thing to take
place in my mind while my work lasts at my office. This day my wife and
I in our way to Paternoster Row to buy things called upon Mr. Hollyard
to advise upon her drying up her issue in her leg, which inclines of
itself to dry up, and he admits of it that it should be dried up.
