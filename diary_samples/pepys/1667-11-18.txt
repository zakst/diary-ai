18th. Up, and all the morning at my office till 3 after noon with Mr.
Hater about perfecting my little pocket market book of the office, till
my eyes were ready to fall out of my head, and then home to dinner,
glad that I had done so much, and so abroad to White Hall, to the
Commissioners of the Treasury, and there did a little business with
them, and so home, leaving multitudes of solicitors at their door, of
one sort or other, complaining for want of such despatch as they had in
my Lord Treasurer’s time, when I believe more business was despatched,
but it was in his manner to the King’s wrong. Among others here was
Gresham College coming about getting a grant of Chelsey College for
their Society, which the King, it seems, hath given them his right in;
but they met with some other pretences, I think; to it, besides the
King’s. Thence took up my wife, whom I had left at her tailor’s, and
home, and there, to save my eyes, got my wife at home to read again,
as last night, in the same book, till W. Batelier come and spent the
evening talking with us, and supped with us, and so to bed.
