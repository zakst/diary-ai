11th. At the office all the morning, Sir W. Batten, Sir W. Pen, and I
about the Victualler’s accounts. Then home to dinner and to the office
again all the afternoon, Mr. Hater and I writing over my Alphabet
fair, in which I took great pleasure to rule the lines and to have the
capitall words wrote with red ink. So home and to supper. This evening
Savill the Paynter came and did varnish over my wife’s picture and mine,
and I paid him for my little picture L3, and so am clear with him. So
after supper to bed. This day I had a letter from my father that he is
got down well, and found my mother pretty well again. So that I am
vexed with all my heart at Pall for writing to him so much concerning my
mother’s illness (which I believe was not so great), so that he should
be forced to hasten down on the sudden back into the country without
taking leave, or having any pleasure here.
