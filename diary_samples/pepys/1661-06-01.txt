June 1st. Having taken our leaves of Sir W. Batten and my Lady, who are
gone this morning to keep their Whitsuntide, Sir W. Pen and I and Mr.
Gauden by water to Woolwich, and there went from ship to ship to give
order for and take notice of their forwardness to go forth, and then to
Deptford and did the like, having dined at Woolwich with Captain Poole
at the tavern there. From Deptford we walked to Redriffe, calling at the
half-way house, and there come into a room where there was infinite of
new cakes placed that are made against Whitsuntide, and there we were
very merry. By water home, and there did businesses of the office. Among
others got my Lord’s imprest of L1000 and Mr. Creed’s of L10,000 against
this voyage their bills signed. Having wrote letters into the country
and read some things I went to bed.
