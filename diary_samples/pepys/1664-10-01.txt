October 1st. Up and at the office both forenoon and afternoon very busy,
and with great pleasure in being so. This morning Mrs. Lane (now Martin)
like a foolish woman, came to the Horseshoe hard by, and sent for me
while I was: at the office; to come to speak with her by a note sealed
up, I know to get me to do something for her husband, but I sent her an
answer that I would see her at Westminster, and so I did not go, and she
went away, poor soul. At night home to supper, weary, and my eyes sore
with writing and reading, and to bed. We go now on with great vigour
in preparing against the Dutch, who, they say, will now fall upon us
without doubt upon this high newes come of our beating them so, wholly
in Guinny.
