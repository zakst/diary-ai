18th. At the office all the morning, and at noon Sir G. Carteret, Mr.
Coventry, and I by invitation to dinner to Sheriff Maynellâ€™s, the great
money-man; he, Alderman Backwell, and much noble and brave company,
with the privilege of their rare discourse, which is great content to me
above all other things in the world. And after a great dinner and much
discourse, we arose and took leave, and home to the business of my
office, where I thank God I take delight, and in the evening to my
lodging and to bed. Among other discourse, speaking concerning the great
charity used in Catholic countrys, Mr. Ashburnham did tell us, that this
last year, there being great want of corn in Paris, and so a collection
made for the poor, there was two pearls brought in, nobody knew from
whom (till the Queen, seeing them, knew whose they were, but did not
discover it), which were sold for 200,000 crownes.
