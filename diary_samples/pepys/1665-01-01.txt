January 1st (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, having been busy late last
night, then up and to my office, where upon ordering my accounts
and papers with respect to my understanding my last year’s gains and
expense, which I find very great, as I have already set down yesterday.
Now this day I am dividing my expense, to see what my clothes and every
particular hath stood me in: I mean all the branches of my expense. At
noon a good venison pasty and a turkey to ourselves without any body
so much as invited by us, a thing unusuall for so small a family of my
condition: but we did it and were very merry. After dinner to my office
again, where very late alone upon my accounts, but have not brought them
to order yet, and very intricate I find it, notwithstanding my care all
the year to keep things in as good method as any man can do. Past 11
o’clock home to supper and to bed.
