14th. Up betimes and to my office, where we sat all the morning, and a
great rant I did give to Mr. Davis, of Deptford, and others about
their usage of Michell, in his Bewpers,--[Bewpers is the old name for
bunting.]--which he serves in for flaggs, which did trouble me, but
yet it was in defence of what was truth. So home to dinner, where Creed
dined with me, and walked a good while in the garden with me after
dinner, talking, among other things, of the poor service which Sir J.
Lawson did really do in the Streights, for which all this great fame
and honour done him is risen. So to my office, where all the afternoon
giving maisters their warrants for this voyage, for which I hope
hereafter to get something at their coming home. In the evening my
wife and I and Ashwell walked in the garden, and I find she is a pretty

     ingenuous by which the former indicates mental, and the second moral
     qualities, was not made in Pepysâ€™s day.]

girl at all sorts of fine work, which pleases me very well, and I hope
will be very good entertainment for my wife without much cost. So to
write by the post, and so home to supper and to bed.
