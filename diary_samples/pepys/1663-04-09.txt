9th. Up betimes and to my office, and anon we met upon finishing the
Treasurer’s accounts. At noon dined at home and am vexed to hear my wife
tell me how our maid Mary do endeavour to corrupt our cook maid, which
did please me very well, but I am resolved to rid the house of her as
soon as I can. To the office and sat all the afternoon till 9 at night,
and an hour after home to supper and bed. My father lying at Tom’s
to-night, he dining with my uncle Fenner and his sons and a great many
more of the gang at his own cost to-day. To bed vexed also to think
of Sir J. Minnes finding fault with Mr. Hater for what he had done the
other day, though there be no hurt in the thing at all but only the old
fool’s jealousy, made worse by Sir W. Batten.
