15th. From my father’s, it being a very foul morning for the King and
Lords to go to Windsor, I went to the office and there met Mr. Coventry
and Sir Robt. Slingsby, but did no business, but only appoint to go to
Deptford together tomorrow. Mr. Coventry being gone, and I having at
home laid up L200 which I had brought this morning home from Alderman
Backwell’s, I went home by coach with Sir R. Slingsby and dined with
him, and had a very good dinner. His lady’ seems a good woman and very
desirous they were to hear this noon by the post how the election has
gone at Newcastle, wherein he is concerned, but the letters are not come
yet. To my uncle Wight’s, and after a little stay with them he and I to
Mr. Rawlinson’s, and there staid all the afternoon, it being very foul,
and had a little talk with him what good I might make of these ships
that go to Portugal by venturing some money by them, and he will give me
an answer to it shortly. So home and sent for the Barber, and after that
to bed.
