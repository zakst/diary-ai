7th. W. Howe called me up to give him a letter to carry to my Lord that
came to me to-day, which I did and so to, sleep again. About three
in the morning the people began to wash the deck, and the water came
pouring into my mouth, which waked me, and I was fain to rise and get
on my gown, and sleep leaning on my table. This morning Mr. Montagu went
away again. After dinner come Mr. John Wright and Mr. Moore, with the
sight of whom my heart was very glad. They brought an order for my
Lord’s coming up to London, which my Lord resolved to do tomorrow. All
the afternoon getting my things in order to set forth to-morrow. At
night walked up and down with Mr. Moore, who did give me an account of
all things at London. Among others, how the Presbyterians would be angry
if they durst, but they will not be able to do any thing. Most of the
Commanders on board and supped with my Lord. Late at night came Mr. Edw.
Pickering from London, but I could not see him this night. I went with
Mr. Moore to the Master’s cabin, and saw him there in order to going to
bed. After that to my own cabin to put things in order and so to bed.
