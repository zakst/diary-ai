28th. Up early among my workmen, then Mr. Creed coming to see me I went
along with him to Sir Robert Slingsby (he being newly maister of that
title by being made a Baronett) to discourse about Mr. Creed’s accounts
to be made up, and from thence by coach to my cozen Thomas Pepys, to
borrow L1000 for my Lord, which I am to expect an answer to tomorrow.
So to my Lord’s, and there staid and dined, and after dinner did get my
Lord to view Mr. Shepley’s accounts as I had examined them, and also to
sign me a bond for my L500. Then with Mr. Shepley to the Theatre and saw
“Rollo” ill acted. That done to drink a cup of ale and so by coach to
London, and having set him down in Cheapside I went home, where I found
a great deal of work done to-day, and also L70 paid me by the Treasurer
upon the bill of exchange that I have had hopes of so long, so that, my
heart in great content; I went to bed.
