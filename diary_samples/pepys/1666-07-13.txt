13th. Lay sleepy in bed till 8 in the morning, then up and to the
office, where till about noon, then out to the â€˜Change and several
places, and so home to dinner. Then out again to Sir R. Vines, and there
to my content settled the business of two tallys, so as I shall
have L2000 almost more of my owne money in my hand, which pleases me
mightily, and so home and there to the office, where mighty busy, and
then home to supper and to even my Journall and to bed. Our fleete being
now in all points ready to sayle, but for the carrying of the two or
three new ships, which will keepe them a day or two or three more. It
is said the Dutch is gone off our coast, but I have no good reason to
believe it, Sir W. Coventry not thinking any such thing.
