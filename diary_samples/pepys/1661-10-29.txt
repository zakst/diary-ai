29th. This day I put on my half cloth black stockings and my new coat
of the fashion, which pleases me well, and with my beaver I was (after
office was done) ready to go to my Lord Mayor’s feast, as we are all
invited; but the Sir Williams were both loth to go, because of the
crowd, and so none of us went, and I staid and dined with them, and so
home, and in evening, by consent, we met at the Dolphin, where other
company came to us, and should have been merry, but their wine was so
naught, and all other things out of order, that we were not so, but
staid long at night, and so home and to bed. My mind not pleased
with the spending of this day, because I had proposed a great deal of
pleasure to myself this day at Guildhall. This Lord Mayor, it seems,
brings up again the Custom of Lord Mayors going the day of their
installment to Paul’s, and walking round about the Cross, and offering
something at the altar.
