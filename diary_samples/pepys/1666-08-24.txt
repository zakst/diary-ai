24th. Up, and dispatched several businesses at home in the morning, and
then comes Sympson to set up my other new presses

     [These presses still exist, and, according to Pepys’s wish, they are
     placed in the second court of Magdalene College in a room which they

extraordinary satisfaction; so that I think it will be as noble a
closett as any man hath, and light enough--though, indeed, it would be

Journall, and then to bed with great content in my day’s worke. This
afternoon comes Mrs. Barbary Sheldon, now Mrs. Wood, to see my wife. I
was so busy I would not see her. But she came, it seems, mighty rich in
rings and fine clothes, and like a lady, and says she is matched mighty
well, at which I am very glad, but wonder at her good fortune and the
folly of her husband, and vexed at myself for not paying her the respect
of seeing her, but I will come out of her debt another time.
