30th (Lord’s day). Lay long in bed, and being up, I went with Will to
my Lord’s, calling in at many churches in my way. There I found Mr.
Shepley, in his Venetian cap, taking physique in his chamber, and with
him I sat till dinner. My Lord dined abroad and my Lady in her chamber,
so Mr. Hetly, Child and I dined together, and after dinner Mr. Child and
I spent some time at the lute, and so promising to prick me some lessons
to my theorbo he went away to see Henry Laws, who lies very sick. I to
the Abby and walked there, seeing the great confusion of people that
come there to hear the organs. So home, calling in at my father’s,
but staid not, my father and mother being both forth. At home I fell
a-reading of Fuller’s Church History till it was late, and so to bed.
