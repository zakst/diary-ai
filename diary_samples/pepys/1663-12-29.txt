29th. Up and to the office, where all the morning sitting, at noon to
the ‘change, and there I found and brought home Mr. Pierse the surgeon
to dinner. Where I found also Mr. Luellin and Mount, and merry at
dinner, but their discourse so free.... that I was weary of them. But
after dinner Luellin took me up to my chamber to give me L50 for the
service I did him, though not so great as he expected and I intended.
But I told him that I would not sell my liberty to any man. If he would
give me any thing by another’s hand I would endeavour to deserve it,
but I will never give him himself thanks for it, not acknowledging the
receiving of any, which he told me was reasonable. I did also tell him
that neither this nor any thing should make me to do any thing that
should not be for the King’s service besides. So we parted and left them
three at home with my wife going to cards, and I to my office and there
staid late. Sir W. Pen came like a cunning rogue to sit and talk with me
about office business and freely about the Comptroller’s business of the
office, to which I did give him free answers and let him make the best
of them. But I know him to be a knave, and do say nothing that I fear
to have said again. Anon came Sir W. Warren, and after talking of his
business of the masts and helping me to understand some foul dealing in
the business of Woods we fell to other talk, and particularly to speak
of some means how to part this great familiarity between Sir W. Batten
and Sir J. Minnes, and it is easy to do by any good friend of Sir J.
Minnes to whom it will be a good service, and he thinks that Sir
J. Denham will be a proper man for it, and so do I. So after other
discourse we parted, and I home and to bed.
