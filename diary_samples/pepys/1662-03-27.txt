27th. Early Sir G. Carteret, both Sir Williams and I by coach to
Deptford, it being very windy and rainy weather, taking a codd and some
prawnes in Fish Street with us. We settled to pay the Guernsey, a small
ship, but come to a great deal of money, it having been unpaid ever
since before the King came in, by which means not only the King pays
wages while the ship has lain still, but the poor men have most of them
been forced to borrow all the money due for their wages before they
receive it, and that at a dear rate, God knows, so that many of them
had very little to receive at the table, which grieved me to see it. To
dinner, very merry. Then Sir George to London, and we again to the
pay, and that done by coach home again and to the office, doing some
business, and so home and to bed.
