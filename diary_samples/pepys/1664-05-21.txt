21st. Up, called by Mr. Cholmely, and walked with him in the garden till
others came to another Committee of Tangier, as we did meet as we did
use to do, to see more of Povy’s folly, and so broke up, and at the
office sat all the morning, Mr. Coventry with us, and very hot we are
getting out some ships. At noon to the ‘Change, and there did some
business, and thence home to dinner, and so abroad with my wife by coach
to the New Exchange, and there laid out almost 40s. upon her, and so
called to see my Lady Sandwich, whom we found in her dining-room, which
joyed us mightily; but she looks very thin, poor woman, being mightily
broke. She told us that Mr. Montagu is to return to Court, as she hears,
which I wonder at, and do hardly believe. So home and to my office,
where late, and so home to supper and to bed.
