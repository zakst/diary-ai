12th. Up, and walked to the office, where we sat late, and thence to
dinner home with Sir J. Minnes, and so to the office, where writing
letters, and home in the evening, where my wife shews me a letter from
her brother speaking of their fatherâ€™s being ill, like to die, which,
God forgive me! did not trouble me so much as it should, though I was
indeed sorry for it. I did presently resolve to send him something in a
letter from my wife, viz. 20s. So to bed.
