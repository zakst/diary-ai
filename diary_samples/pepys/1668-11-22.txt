22nd (Lord’s day). My wife and I lay long, with mighty content; and so
rose, and she spent the whole day making herself clean, after four or
five weeks being in continued dirt; and I knocking up nails, and making
little settlements in my house, till noon, and then eat a bit of meat in
the kitchen, I all alone. And so to the Office, to set down my journall,
for some days leaving it imperfect, the matter being mighty grievous to
me, and my mind, from the nature of it; and so in, to solace myself with
my wife, whom I got to read to me, and so W. Hewer and the boy; and so,
after supper, to bed. This day my boy’s livery is come home, the first I
ever had, of greene, lined with red; and it likes me well enough.
