13th. Up, and down to Tower Wharfe; and there, with Batty and labourers
from Deptford, did get my goods housed well at home. So down to Deptford
again to fetch the rest, and there eat a bit of dinner at the Globe,
with the master of the Bezan with me, while the labourers went to
dinner. Here I hear that this poor towne do bury still of the plague
seven or eight in a day. So to Sir G. Carteretâ€™s to work, and there did
to my content ship off into the Bezan all the rest of my goods, saving
my pictures and fine things, that I will bring home in wherrys when the
house is fit to receive them: and so home, and unload them by carts and
hands before night, to my exceeding satisfaction: and so after supper to
bed in my house, the first time I have lain there; and lay with my wife
in my old closett upon the ground, and Batty and his wife in the best
chamber, upon the ground also.
