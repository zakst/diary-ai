6th. To Whitehall by water with Sir W. Batten, and in our passage told
me how Commissioner Pett did pay himself for the entertainment that he
did give the King at Chatham at his coming in, and 20s. a day all the
time he was in Holland, which I wonder at, and so I see there is a great
deal of envy between the two. At Whitehall I met with Commissioner Pett,
who told me how Mr. Coventry and Fairbank his solicitor are falling out,
one complaining of the other for taking too great fees, which is too
true. I find that Commissioner Pett is under great discontent, and is
loth to give too much money for his place, and so do greatly desire me
to go along with him in what we shall agree to give Mr. Coventry, which
I have promised him, but am unwilling to mix my fortune with him that
is going down the wind. We all met this morning and afterwards at the
Admiralty, where our business is to ask provision of victuals ready for
the ships in the Downs, which we did, Mr. Gauden promising to go himself
thither and see it done. Dined Will and I at my Lord’s upon a joint of
meat that I sent Mrs. Sarah for. Afterwards to my office and sent all my
books to my Lord’s, in order to send them to my house that I now dwell
in. Home and to bed.
