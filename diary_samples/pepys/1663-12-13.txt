13th (Lord’s day). Up and made me ready for Church, but my wife and I
had a difference about her old folly that she would fasten lies upon her
mayds, and now upon Jane, which I did not see enough to confirm me in
it, and so would not consent to her. To church, where after sermon
home, and to my office, before dinner, reading my vowes, and so home to
dinner, where Tom came to me and he and I dined together, my wife not
rising all day, and after dinner I made even accounts with him, and
spent all the afternoon in my chamber talking of many things with him,
and about Wheately’s daughter for a wife for him, and then about the
Joyces and their father Fenner, how they are sometimes all honey one
with another and then all turd, and a strange rude life there is among
them. In the evening, he gone, I to my office to read Rushworth upon
the charge and answer of the Duke of Buckingham, which is very fine, and
then to do a little business against to-morrow, and so home to supper to
my wife, and then to bed.
