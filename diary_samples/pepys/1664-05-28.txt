28th. Up pretty well as to pain and wind, and to the office, where we
sat close and did much business. At noon I to the ‘Change, and thence
to Mr. Cutler’s, where I heard Sir W. Rider was, where I found them at
dinner and dined with them, he having yesterday and to-day a fit of a
pain like the gout, the first time he ever had it. A good dinner. Good
discourse, Sir W. Rider especially much fearing the issue of a Dutch
warr, wherein I very highly commend him. Thence home, and at the
office a while, and then with Mr. Deane to a second lesson upon my
Shipwrightry, wherein I go on with great pleasure. He being gone I to
the office late, and so home to supper and to bed. But, Lord! to see
how my very going to the ‘Change, and being without my gowne, presently
brought me wind and pain, till I came home and was well again; but I am
come to such a pass that I shall not know what to do with myself, but
I am apt to think that it is only my legs that I take cold in from my
having so long worn a gowne constantly.
