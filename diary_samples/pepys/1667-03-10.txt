10th (Lord’s day). Having my cold still grown more upon me, so as I am
not able to speak, I lay in bed till noon, and then up and to my chamber
with a good fire, and there spent an hour on Morly’s Introduction to
Musique, a very good but unmethodical book. Then to dinner, my wife and
I, and then all the afternoon alone in my chamber preparing a letter for
Commissioner Taylor to the City about getting his accounts for The Loyal
London,

     [The “Loyal London” was the ship given to the king by the City.  It
     was launched at Deptford on June 10th, 1666]

by him built for them, stated and discharged, they owing him still about
L4000. Towards the evening comes Mr. Spong to see me, whose discourse
about several things I proposed to him was very good, better than I have
had with any body a good while. He gone, I to my business again, and
anon comes my Lady Pen and her son-in law and daughter, and there we
talked all the evening away, and then to supper; and after supper comes
Sir W. Pen, and there we talked together, and then broke up, and so to
bed. He tells me that our Mr. Turner has seen the proclamation against
the Duke of Buckingham, and that therefore it is true what we heard
last night. Yesterday and to-day I have been troubled with a hoarseness
through cold that I could not almost speak.
