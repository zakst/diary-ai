15th. Our victualling ships to set them agoing, and so home, and after
dinner to the King’s playhouse, all alone, and saw “Love’s Maistresse.”
 Some pretty things and good variety in it, but no or little fancy in it.
Thence to the Duke of Albemarle to give him account of my day’s works,
where he shewed me letters from Sir G. Downing, of four days’ date, that
the Dutch are come out and joyned, well-manned, and resolved to board
our best ships, and fight for certain they will. Thence to the Swan at
Herbert’s, and there the company of Sarah a little while, and so
away and called at the Harp and Ball, where the mayde, Mary, is very
‘formosa’--[handsome]--; but, Lord! to see in what readiness I am, upon
the expiring of my vowes this day, to begin to run into all my pleasures
and neglect of business. Thence home, and being sleepy to bed.
