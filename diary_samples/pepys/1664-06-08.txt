8th. All day before dinner with Creed, talking of many things, among
others, of my Lordâ€™s going so often to Chelsy, and he, without my
speaking much, do tell me that his daughters do perceive all, and do
hate the place, and the young woman there, Mrs. Betty Becke; for my
Lord, who sent them thither only for a disguise for his going thither,
will come under pretence to see them, and pack them out of doors to the
Parke, and stay behind with her; but now the young ladies are gone to
their mother to Kensington. To dinner, and after dinner till 10 at night
in my study writing of my old broken office notes in shorthand all in
one book, till my eyes did ake ready to drop out. So home to supper and
to bed.
