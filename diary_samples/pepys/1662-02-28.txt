28th. The boy failing to call us up as I commanded, I was angry, and
resolved to whip him for that and many other faults, to-day. Early with
Sir W. Pen by coach to Whitehall, to the Duke of York’s chamber, and
there I presented him from my Lord a fine map of Tangier, done by one
Captain Beckman, a Swede, that is with my Lord. We staid looking it over
a great while with the Duke after he was ready. Thence I by water to the
Painter’s, and there sat again for my face in little, and thence home to
dinner, and so at home all the afternoon. Then came Mr. Moore and
staid and talked with me, and then I to the office, there being all the
Admiralty papers brought hither this afternoon from Mr. Blackburne’s,
where they have lain all this while ever since my coming into this
office. This afternoon Mr. Hater received half a year’s salary for me,
so that now there is not owing me but this quarter, which will be out
the next month. Home, and to be as good as my word, I bade Will get me
a rod, and he and I called the boy up to one of the upper rooms of the
Comptroller’s house towards the garden, and there I reckoned all his
faults, and whipped him soundly, but the rods were so small that I fear
they did not much hurt to him, but only to my arm, which I am already,
within a quarter of an hour, not able to stir almost. After supper to
bed.
