24th. To White Hall, where I did acquaint Mr. Watkins with my being
sworn into the Privy Seal, at which he was much troubled, but put it up
and did offer me a kinsman of his to be my clerk, which I did give him
some hope of, though I never intend it. In the afternoon I spent much
time in walking in White Hall Court with Mr. Bickerstaffe, who was very
glad of my Lord’s being sworn, because of his business with his
brother Baron, which is referred to my Lord Chancellor, and to be ended
to-morrow. Baron had got a grant beyond sea, to come in before the
reversionary of the Privy Seal. This afternoon Mr. Mathews came to me,
to get a certificate of my Lord’s and my being sworn, which I put in
some forwardness, and so home and to bed.
