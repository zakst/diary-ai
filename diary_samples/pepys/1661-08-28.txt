28th. At home all the morning setting papers in order. At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr. Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise
with about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely
that we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet. I do
doubt it very much. I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so
home. This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief
that stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.
