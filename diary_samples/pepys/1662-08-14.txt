14th. Up early and to look on my works, and find my house to go on
apace. So to my office to prepare business, and then we met and sat till
noon, and then Commissioner Pett and I being invited, went by Sir John
Winter’s coach sent for us, to the Mitre, in Fenchurch street, to a
venison-pasty; where I found him a very worthy man; and good discourse.
Most of which was concerning the Forest of Dean, and the timber there,
and iron-workes with their great antiquity, and the vast heaps of
cinders which they find, and are now of great value, being necessary for
the making of iron at this day; and without which they cannot work: with
the age of many trees there left at a great fall in Edward the Third’s
time, by the name of forbid-trees, which at this day are called vorbid
trees. Thence to my office about business till late, and so home and to
bed.
