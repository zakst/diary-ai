21st. Early with Mr. Moore by coach to Chelsy, to my Lord Privy Seal’s,
but have missed of coming time enough; and having taken up Mr. Pargiter,
the goldsmith (who is the man of the world that I do most know and
believe to be a cheating rogue), we drank our morning draft there
together of cake and ale, and did make good sport of his losing so much
by the King’s coming in, he having bought much of Crown lands, of which,
God forgive me! I am very glad. At Whitehall, at the Privy Seal, did
with Sir W. Pen take advice about passing of things of his there that
concern his matters of Ireland. Thence to the Wardrobe and dined, and so
against my judgment and conscience (which God forgive, for my very heart
knows that I offend God in breaking my vows herein) to the Opera, which
is now newly begun to act again, after some alteracion of their scene,
which do make it very much worse; but the play, “Love and Honour,” being
the first time of their acting it, is a very good plot, and well done.
So on foot home, and after a little business done in my study and
supper, to bed.
