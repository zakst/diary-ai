5th (Lord’s day). Up, and Mr. Burston bringing me by order my Lord’s
plates, which he has been making this week. I did take coach and to my
Lord Sandwich’s and dined with my Lord; it being the first time he hath
dined at home since his coming from sea: and a pretty odd demand it was
of my Lord to my Lady before me: “How do you, sweetheart? How have you
done all this week?” himself taking notice of it to me, that he had
hardly seen her the week before. At dinner he did use me with the
greatest solemnity in the world, in carving for me, and nobody else, and
calling often to my Lady to cut for me; and all the respect possible.
After dinner looked over the plates, liked them mightily, and indeed I
think he is the most exact man in what he do in the world of that kind.
So home again, and there after a song or two in the evening with Mr.
Hill, I to my office, and then home to supper and to bed.
