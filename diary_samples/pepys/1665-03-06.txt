6th. Up, and with Sir J. Minnes by coach, being a most lamentable cold
day as any this year, to St. Jamesâ€™s, and there did our business with
the Duke. Great preparations for his speedy return to sea. I saw him try
on his buff coat and hatpiece covered with black velvet. It troubles me
more to think of his venture, than of anything else in the whole warr.
Thence home to dinner, where I saw Besse go away; she having of all
wenches that ever lived with us received the greatest love and kindnesse
and good clothes, besides wages, and gone away with the greatest
ingratitude. I then abroad to look after my Hamaccoes, and so home, and
there find our new chamber-mayde, Mary, come, which instead of handsome,
as my wife spoke and still seems to reckon, is a very ordinary wench, I
think, and therein was mightily disappointed. To my office, where busy
late, and then home to supper and to bed, and was troubled all this
night with a pain in my left testicle, that run up presently into my
left kidney and there kept akeing all night. In great pain.
