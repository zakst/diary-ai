23rd. At the office all the morning, whither Sir W. Coventry sent me
word that the Dutch fleete is certainly abroad; and so we are to hasten
all we have to send to our fleete with all speed. But, Lord! to see how
my Lord Bruncker undertakes the despatch of the fire-ships, when he is
no more fit for it than a porter; and all the while Sir W. Pen, who is
the most fit, is unwilling to displease him, and do not look after it;
and so the King’s work is like to be well done. At noon dined at home,
Lovett with us; but he do not please me in his business, for he
keeps things long in hand, and his paper do not hold so good as I
expected--the varnish wiping off in a little time--a very sponge; and
I doubt by his discourse he is an odde kind of fellow, and, in plain
terms, a very rogue. He gone, I to the office (having seen and liked the
upholsters’ work in my roome--which they have almost done), and there
late, and in the evening find Mr. Batelier and his sister there and then
we talked and eat and were merry, and so parted late, and to bed.
