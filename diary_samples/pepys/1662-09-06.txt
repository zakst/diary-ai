6th. Lay long, that is, till 6 and past before I rose, in order to sweat
a little away the cold which I was afraid I might have got yesterday,
but I bless God I am well. So up and to my office, and then we met and
sat till noon, very full of business. Then Sir John Minnes, both Sir
Williams and I to the Trinity House, where we had at dinner a couple of
venison pasties, of which I eat but little, being almost cloyed, having
been at five pasties in three days, namely, two at our own feast,
and one yesterday, and two to-day. So home and at the office all the
afternoon, busy till nine at night, and so to my lodging and to bed.
This afternoon I had my new key and the lock of my office door altered,
having lost my key the other day, which vexed me.
