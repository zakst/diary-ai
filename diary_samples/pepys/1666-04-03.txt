3rd. Up, and Sir W. Warren with me betimes and signed a bond, and
assigned his order on the Exchequer to a blank for me to fill and I did
deliver him L1900. The truth is, it is a great venture to venture so
much on the Act, but thereby I hedge in L300 gift for my service about
some ships that he hath bought, prizes, and good interest besides, and
his bond to repay me the money at six weeks’ warning. So to the office,
where busy all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and there my brother
Balty dined with me and my wife, who is become a good serious man, and
I hope to do him good being sending him a Muster-Master on one of the
squadrons of the fleete. After dinner and he gone I to my accounts hard
all the afternoon till it was quite darke, and I thank God I do come
to bring them very fairly to make me worth L5,000 stocke in the world,
which is a great mercy to me. Though I am a little troubled to find L50
difference between the particular account I make to myself of my
profits and loss in each month and the account which I raise from my
acquittances and money which I have at the end of every month in
my chest and other men’s hands. However I do well believe that I am
effectually L5,000, the greatest sum I ever was in my life yet, and this
day I have as I have said before agreed with Sir W. Warren and got of
him L300 gift. At night a while to the office and then home and supped
and to my accounts again till I was ready to sleepe, there being no
pleasure to handle them, if they are not kept in good order. So to bed.
