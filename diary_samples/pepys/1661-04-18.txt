18th. Up with my workmen and then about 9 oâ€™clock took horse with both
the Sir Williams for Walthamstow, and there we found my Lady and her
daughters all; and a pleasant day it was, and all things else, but that
my Lady was in a bad mood, which we were troubled at, and had she
been noble she would not have been so with her servants, when we came
thither, and this Sir W. Pen took notice of, as well as I. After dinner
we all went to the Church stile, and there eat and drank, and I was as
merry as I could counterfeit myself to be. Then, it raining hard, we
left Sir W. Batten, and we two returned and called at Mr.----and drank
some brave wine there, and then homewards again and in our way met with
two country fellows upon one horse, which I did, without much ado, give
the way to, but Sir W. Pen would not, but struck them and they him, and
so passed away, but they giving him some high words, he went back again
and struck them off their horse, in a simple fury, and without much
honour, in my mind, and so came away. Home, and I sat with him a good
while talking, and then home and to bed.
