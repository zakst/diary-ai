30th. Up, and vexed a little to be forced to pay 40s. for a glass of my
coach, which was broke the other day, nobody knows how, within the door,
while it was down; but I do doubt that I did break it myself with my
knees. After dinner, my wife and I to the Duke’s playhouse, and there
did see King Harry the Eighth; and was mightily pleased, better than I
ever expected, with the history and shows of it. We happened to sit by
Mr. Andrews, our neighbour, and his wife, who talked so fondly to his
little boy. Thence my wife and I to the ‘Change; but, in going, our
neere horse did fling himself, kicking of the coachbox over the pole;
and a great deal of trouble it was to get him right again, and we forced
to ‘light, and in great fear of spoiling the horse, but there was no
hurt. So to the ‘Change, and then home, and there spent the evening
talking, and so to supper and to bed.
