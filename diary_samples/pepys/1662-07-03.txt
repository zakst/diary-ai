3rd. Up by four o’clock and to my office till 8 o’clock, writing over
two copies of our contract with Sir W. Rider, &c., for 500 ton of hempe,
which, because it is a secret, I have the trouble of writing over as
well as drawing. Then home to dress myself, and so to the office, where
another fray between Sir R. Ford and myself about his yarn, wherein
I find the board to yield on my side, and was glad thereof, though
troubled that the office should fall upon me of disobliging Sir Richard.
At noon we all by invitation dined at the Dolphin with the Officers
of the Ordnance; where Sir W. Compton, Mr. O’Neale, and other great
persons, were, and a very great dinner, but I drank as I still do but my
allowance of wine. After dinner, was brought to Sir W. Compton a gun to
discharge seven times, the best of all devices that ever I saw, and
very serviceable, and not a bawble; for it is much approved of, and many
thereof made. Thence to my office all the afternoon as long as I could
see, about setting many businesses in order. In the evening came Mr.
Lewis to me, and very ingeniously did enquire whether I ever did look
into the business of the Chest at Chatham;
