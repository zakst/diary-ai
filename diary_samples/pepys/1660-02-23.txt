23rd. Thursday, my birthday, now twenty-seven years. A pretty fair
morning, I rose and after writing a while in my study I went forth.
To my office, where I told Mr. Hawly of my thoughts to go out of town
to-morrow. Hither Mr. Fuller comes to me and my Uncle Thomas too, thence
I took them to drink, and so put off my uncle. So with Mr. Fuller home
to my house, where he dined with me, and he told my wife and me a great
many stories of his adversities, since these troubles, in being forced
to travel in the Catholic countries, &c. He shewed me his bills, but I
had not money to pay him. We parted, and I to Whitehall, where I was to
see my horse which Mr. Garthwayt lends me to-morrow. So home, where Mr.
Pierce comes to me about appointing time and place where and when to
meet tomorrow. So to Westminster Hall, where, after the House rose, I
met with Mr. Crew, who told me that my Lord was chosen by 73 voices,
to be one of the Council of State. Mr. Pierpoint had the most, 101,
and himself the next, too. He brought me in the coach home. He and Mr.
Anslow being in it. I back to the Hall, and at Mrs. Michellâ€™s shop staid
talking a great while with her and my Chaplain, Mr. Mumford, and drank
a pot or two of ale on a wager that Mr. Prin is not of the Council. Home
and wrote to my Lord the news of the choice of the Council by the post,
and so to bed.
