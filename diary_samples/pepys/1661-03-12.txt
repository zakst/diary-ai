12th. At the office about business all the morning, so to the Exchange,
and there met with Nick Osborne lately married, and with him to the
Fleece, where we drank a glass of wine. So home, where I found Mrs. Hunt
in great trouble about her husband’s losing of his place in the Excise.
From thence to Guildhall, and there set my hand to the book before
Colonel King for my sea pay, and blessed be God! they have cast me at
midshipman’s pay, which do make my heart very glad. So, home, and there
had Sir W. Batten and my Lady and all their company and Capt. Browne and
his wife to a collation at my house till it was late, and then to bed.
