6th. At my office all alone all the morning, and the smith being with me
about other things, did open a chest that hath stood ever since I came
to the office, in my office, and there we found a modell of a fine ship,
which I long to know whether it be the King’s or Mr. Turner’s. At noon
to the Wardrobe by appointment to meet my father, who did come and was
well treated by my Lady, who tells me she has some thoughts to send her
two little boys to our house at Brampton, but I have got leave for them
to go along with me and my wife to Hampton Court to-morrow or Sunday.
Thence to my brother Tom’s, where we found a letter from Pall that my
mother is dangerously ill in fear of death, which troubles my father
and me much, but I hope it is otherwise, the letter being four days old
since it was writ. Home and at my office, and with Mr. Hater set things
in order till evening, and so home and to bed by daylight. This day at
my father’s desire I lent my brother Tom L20, to be repaid out of the
proceeds of Sturtlow when we can sell it. I sent the money all in new
money by my boy from Alderman Backwell’s.
