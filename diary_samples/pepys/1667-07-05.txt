5th. Up, and to the office, where Sir W. Batten, [Sir] W. Pen, [Sir]
T. Harvy and I met upon Mr. Gawden’s accounts, and was at it all the
morning. This morning Sir G. Carteret did come to us, and walked in the
garden. It was to talk with me about some thing of my Lord Sandwich’s,
but here he told us that the great seale is passed to my Lord Annesly
[Anglesey] for Treasurer of the Navy: so that now he do no more belong
to us: and I confess, for his sake, I am glad of it, and do believe the
other will have little content in it. At noon I home to dinner with my
wife, and after dinner to sing, and then to the office a little and Sir
W. Batten’s, where I am vexed to hear that Nan Wright, now Mrs. Markham,
Sir W. Pen’s mayde and whore, is come to sit in our pew at church, and
did so while my Lady Batten was there. I confess I am very much vexed at
it and ashamed. By and by out with [Sir] W. Pen to White Hall, where
I staid not, but to the New Exchange to buy gloves and other little
errands, and so home and to my office busy till night, and then walked
in the garden with my wife, and then to supper and to sing, and so to
bed. No news, but that the Dutch are gone clear from Harwich northward,
and have given out they are going to Yarmouth.
