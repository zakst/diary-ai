16th. Up and to my workmen, and then to the office, and there we sat
till noon; then to the Exchange, and in my way met with the housekeeper
of this office, and he did give me so good an account of my chamber in
my house about which I am so much troubled that I am well at ease in my
mind. At my office all the afternoon alone. In the evening Sir J. M. and
I walked together a good while in the garden, very pleasant, and takes
no notice that he do design any further trouble to me about my house. At
night eat a bit of bread and cheese, and so to my lodgings and to bed,
my mind ill at ease for these particulars: my house in dirt, and like to
lose my best chamber. My wife writes me from the country that she is not
pleased there with my father nor mother, nor any of her servants, and
that my boy is turned a very rogue. I have L30 to pay to the cavaliers:
then a doubt about my being forced to leave all my business here, when I
am called to the court at Brampton; and lastly, my law businesses, which
vex me to my heart what I shall be able to do next term, which is near
at hand.
