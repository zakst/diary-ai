2nd. Up, and to the office, where busy all the morning; at noon home,
and after dinner my wife and Willett and I to the King’s playhouse, and
there saw “Henry the Fourth:” and contrary to expectation, was pleased
in nothing more than in Cartwright’s speaking of Falstaffe’s speech
about “What is Honour?” The house full of Parliament-men, it being
holyday with them: and it was observable how a gentleman of good habit,
sitting just before us, eating of some fruit in the midst of the play,
did drop down as dead, being choked; but with much ado Orange Moll did
thrust her finger down his throat, and brought him to life again. After
the play, we home, and I busy at the office late, and then home to
supper and to bed.
