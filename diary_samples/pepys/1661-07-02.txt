2nd. To Westminster Hall and there walked up and down, it being Term
time. Spoke with several, among others my cozen Roger Pepys, who was
going up to the Parliament House, and inquired whether I had heard from
my father since he went to Brampton, which I had done yesterday, who
writes that my uncle is by fits stupid, and like a man that is drunk,
and sometimes speechless. Home, and after my singing master had done,
took coach and went to Sir William Davenant’s Opera; this being the
fourth day that it hath begun, and the first that I have seen it. To-day
was acted the second part of “The Siege of Rhodes.” We staid a very
great while for the King and the Queen of Bohemia. And by the breaking
of a board over our heads, we had a great deal of dust fell into the
ladies’ necks and the men’s hair, which made good sport. The King being
come, the scene opened; which indeed is very fine and magnificent, and
well acted, all but the Eunuch, who was so much out that he was hissed
off the stage. Home and wrote letters to my Lord at sea, and so to bed.
