22nd. All the morning at the office. Dined at home, and then to White
Hall with Symson the joyner, and after attending at the Committee of the
Navy about the old business of tickets, where the only expedient they
have found is to bind the Commanders and Officers by oaths. The Duke
of York told me how the Duke of Buckingham, after the Council the other
day, did make mirth at my position, about the sufficiency of present
rules in the business of tickets; and here I took occasion to desire
a private discourse with the Duke of York, and he granted it to me on
Friday next. So to shew Symson the Kingâ€™s new lodgings for his chimnies,
which I desire to have one built in that mode, and so I home, and with
little supper, to bed. This day a falling out between my wife and Deb.,
about a hood lost, which vexed me.
