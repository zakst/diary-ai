11th. Up, after much pleasant discourse with my wife, and to the office,
where we sat all the morning, and did much business, and some much to
my content by prevailing against Sir W. Batten for the Kingâ€™s profit. At
noon home to dinner, my wife and I hand to fist to a very fine pig. This
noon Mr. Falconer came and visited my wife, and brought her a present, a
silver state-cup and cover, value about L3 or L4, for the courtesy I did
him the other day. He did not stay dinner with me. I am almost sorry
for this present, because I would have reserved him for a place to go in
summer a-visiting at Woolwich with my wife.
