10th. All the morning clearing our cellars, and breaking in pieces all
my old lumber, to make room, and to prevent fire. And then to Sir W.
Batten’s, and dined; and there hear that Sir W. Rider says that the
towne is full of the report of the wealth that is in his house, and
would be glad that his friends would provide for the safety of their
goods there. This made me get a cart; and thither, and there brought
my money all away. Took a hackney-coach myself (the hackney-coaches now
standing at Allgate). Much wealth indeed there is at his house. Blessed
be God, I got all mine well thence, and lodged it in my office; but
vexed to have all the world see it. And with Sir W. Batten, who would
have taken away my hands before they were stowed. But by and by comes
brother Balty from sea, which I was glad of; and so got him, and Mr.
Tooker, and the boy, to watch with them all in the office all night,
while I upon Jane’s coming went down to my wife, calling at Deptford,
intending to see Bagwell, but did not ‘ouvrir la porte comme je’ did
expect. So down late to Woolwich, and there find my wife out of humour
and indifferent, as she uses upon her having much liberty abroad.
