13th. This morning I was sent for by my uncle Fenner to come and advise
about the buriall of my aunt, the butcher, who died yesterday; and from
thence to the Anchor, by Doctor’s Commons, and there Dr. Williams and I
did write a letter for my purpose to Mr. Sedgewick, of Cambridge, about
Gravely business, and after that I left him and an attorney with him and
went to the Wardrobe, where I found my wife, and thence she and I to
the water to spend the afternoon in pleasure; and so we went to old
George’s, and there eat as much as we would of a hot shoulder of mutton,
and so to boat again and home. So to bed, my mind very full of business
and trouble.
