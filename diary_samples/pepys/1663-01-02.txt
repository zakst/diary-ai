2nd. Lay long in bed, and so up and to the office, where all the morning
alone doing something or another. So dined at home with my wife, and in
the afternoon to the Treasury office, where Sir W. Batten was paying off
tickets, but so simply and arbitrarily, upon a dull pretence of doing
right to the King, though to the wrong of poor people (when I know
there is no man that means the King less right than he, or would trouble
himself less about it, but only that he sees me stir, and so he would
appear doing something, though to little purpose), that I was weary of
it. At last we broke up, and walk home together, and I to see Sir W.
Pen, who is fallen sick again. I staid a while talking with him, and so
to my office, practising some arithmetique, and so home to supper and
bed, having sat up late talking to my poor wife with great content.
