17th. Up, and to the Office all the morning, where the new Treasurers
come, their second time, and before they sat down, did discourse with
the Board, and particularly my Lord Brouncker, about their place,
which they challenge, as having been heretofore due, and given to their
predecessor; which, at last, my Lord did own hath been given him only
out of courtesy to his quality, and that he did not take it as a right
at the Board: so they, for the present, sat down, and did give him
the place, but, I think, with an intent to have the Duke of Yorkâ€™s
directions about it. My wife and maids busy now, to make clean the house
above stairs, the upholsters having done there, in her closet and the
blue room, and they are mighty pretty. At my office all the afternoon
and at night busy, and so home to my wife, and pretty pleasant, and at
mighty ease in my mind, being in hopes to find Deb., and without trouble
or the knowledge of my wife. So to supper at night and to bed.
