21st. This morning going to my father’s I met him, and so he and I went
and drank our morning draft at the Samson in Paul’s Churchyard, and eat
some gammon of bacon, &c., and then parted, having bought some green
Say--[A woollen cloth. “Saye clothe serge.”--Palsgrave.]--for curtains
in my parler. Home, and so to the Exchequer, where I met with my uncle
Wight, and home with him to dinner, where among others (my aunt being
out of town), Mr. Norbury and I did discourse of his wife’s house and
land at Brampton, which I find too much for me to buy. Home, and in the
afternoon to the office, and much pleased at night to see my house begin
to be clean after all the dirt.
