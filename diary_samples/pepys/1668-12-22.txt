22nd. At the office all the morning, and at noon to the ‘Change,
thinking to meet with Langford about my father’s house in Fleet Streete,
but I come too late, and so home to dinner, and all the afternoon at
the office busy, and at night home to supper and talk, and with mighty
content with my wife, and so to bed.
