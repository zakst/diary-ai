17th. Up, and it being bitter cold, and frost and snow, which I had
thought had quite left us, I by coach to Povy’s, where he told me, as I
knew already, how he was handled the other day, and is still, by my Lord
Barkeley, and among other things tells me, what I did not know, how
my Lord Barkeley will say openly, that he hath fought more set
fields--[Battles or actions]--than any man in England hath done. I did
my business with him, which was to get a little sum of money paid, and
so home with Mr. Andrews, who met me there, and there to the office. At
noon home and there found Lewellin, which vexed me out of my old jealous
humour. So to my office, where till 12 at night, being only a little
while at noon at Sir W. Batten’s to see him, and had some high words
with Sir J. Minnes about Sir W. Warren, he calling him cheating knave,
but I cooled him, and at night at Sir W. Pen’s, he being to go to
Chatham to-morrow. So home to supper and to bed.
