February 1st. Up, and to the office pretty betimes, and the Board
not meeting as soon as I wished, I was forced to go to White Hall in
expectation of a Committee for Tangier, but when I come it was put off,
and so home again to the office, and sat till past two o’clock; where at
the Board some high words passed between Sir W. Pen and I, begun by me,
and yielded to by him, I being in the right in finding fault with him
for his neglect of duty. At noon home to dinner, and after dinner out
with my wife, thinking to have gone to the Duke of York’s playhouse,
but was, to my great content in the saving my vow, hindered by coming a
little too late; and so, it being a fine day, we out to Islington, and
there to the old house and eat cheese-cakes and drank and talked, and so
home in the evening, the ways being mighty bad, so as we had no pleasure
in being abroad at all almost, but only the variety of it, and so to
the office, where busy late, and then home to supper and to bed, my head
mighty full of business now on my hands: viz., of finishing my Tangier
Accounts; of auditing my last year’s Accounts; of preparing answers to
the Commissioners of Accounts; of drawing up several important letters
to the Duke of York and the Commissioners of the Treasury; the marrying
of my sister; the building of a coach and stables against summer, and
the setting many things in the Office right; and the drawing up a new
form of Contract with the Victualler of the Navy, and several other
things, which pains, however, will go through with, among others the
taking care of Kate Joyce in that now she is in at present for saving
her estate.
