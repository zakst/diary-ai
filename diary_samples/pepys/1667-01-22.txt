22nd. Up, and there come to me Darnell the fiddler, one of the Duke’s
house, and brought me a set of lessons, all three parts, I heard them
play to the Duke of York after Christmas at his lodgings, and bid him
get me them. I did give him a crowne for them, and did enquire after
the musique of the “Siege of Rhodes,” which, he tells me, he can get me,
which I am mighty glad of. So to the office, where among other things
I read the Councill’s order about my Lord Bruncker and Sir W. Pen to
be assistants to the Comptroller, which quietly went down with Sir J.
Minnes, poor man, seeming a little as if he would be thought to have
desired it, but yet apparently to his discontent; and, I fear, as the
order runs, it will hardly do much good. At noon to dinner, and there
comes a letter from Mrs. Pierce, telling me she will come and dine with
us on Thursday next, with some of the players, Knipp, &c., which I was
glad of, but my wife vexed, which vexed me; but I seemed merry, but know
not how to order the matter, whether they shall come or no. After
dinner to the office, and there late doing much business, and so home to
supper, and to bed.
