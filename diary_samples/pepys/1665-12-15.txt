15th. Up, and spent all the morning with my Surveyors of the Ports for
the Victualling, and there read to them what instructions I had provided
for them and discoursed largely much of our business and the business
of the pursers. I left them to dine with my people, and to my Lord
Bruncker’s where I met with a great good dinner and Sir T. Teddiman,
with whom my Lord and I were to discourse about the bringing of W. Howe
to a tryall for his jewells, and there till almost night, and so away
toward the office and in my way met with Sir James Bunce; and after
asking what newes, he cried “Ah!” says he (I know [not] whether in
earnest or jest), “this is the time for you,” says he, “that were for
Oliver heretofore; you are full of employment, and we poor Cavaliers sit
still and can get nothing;” which was a pretty reproach, I thought, but
answered nothing to it, for fear of making it worse. So away and I to
see Mrs. Penington, but company being to come to her, I staid not, but
to the office a little and so home, and after supper to bed.
