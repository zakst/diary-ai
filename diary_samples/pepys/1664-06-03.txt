3rd. Up, still in a constant pain in my back, which much afflicts me
with fear of the consequence of it. All the morning at the office, we
sat at the office extraordinary upon the business of our stores, but,
Lord! what a pitiful account the Surveyor makes of it grieves my heart.
This morning before I came out I made a bargain with Captain Taylor for
a ship for the Commissioners for Tangier, wherein I hope to get L40 or
L50. To the ‘Change, and thence home and dined, and then by coach to
White Hall, sending my wife to Mrs. Hunt’s. At the Committee for Tangier
all the afternoon, where a sad consideration to see things of so great
weight managed in so confused a manner as it is, so as I would not
have the buying of an acre of land bought by the Duke of York and Mr.
Coventry, for ought I see, being the only two that do anything like men;
Prince Rupert do nothing but swear and laugh a little, with an oathe or
two, and that’s all he do. Thence called my wife and home, and I late
at my office, and so home to supper and to bed, pleased at my hopes of
gains by to-day’s work, but very sad to think of the state of my health.
