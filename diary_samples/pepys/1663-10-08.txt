8th. So, keeping myself warm, to the office, and at noon home to dinner,
my pain coming again by breaking no wind nor having any stool. So to Mr.
Holliard, and by his direction, he assuring me that it is nothing of the
stone, but only my constitution being costive, and that, and cold from
without, breeding and keeping the wind, I took some powder that he did
give me in white wine, and sat late up, till past eleven at night, with
my wife in my chamber till it had done working, which was so weakly that
I could hardly tell whether it did work or no. My mayds being at this
time in great dirt towards getting of all my house clean, and weary and
having a great deal of work to do therein to-morrow and next day, were
gone to bed before my wife and I, who also do lie in our room more like
beasts than Christians, but that is only in order to having of the house
shortly in a cleaner, or rather very clean condition. Some ease I had so
long as this did keep my body loose, and I slept well.
