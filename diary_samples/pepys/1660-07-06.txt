6th. In the morning with my Lord at Whitehall, got the order of the
Council for us to act. From thence to Westminster Hall, and there met
with the Doctor that shewed us so much kindness at the Hague, and took
him to the Sun tavern, and drank with him. So to my Lord’s and dined
with W. Howe and Sarah, thinking it might be the last time that I
might dine with them together. In the afternoon my Lord and I, and
Mr. Coventry and Sir G. Carteret, went and took possession of the Navy
Office, whereby my mind was a little cheered, but my hopes not great.
From thence Sir G. Carteret and I to the Treasurer’s Office, where he
set some things in order. And so home, calling upon Sir Geoffry Palmer,
who did give me advice about my patent, which put me to some doubt to
know what to do, Barlow being alive. Afterwards called at Mr. Pim’s,
about getting me a coat of velvet, and he took me to the Half Moon, and
the house so full that we staid above half an hour before we could get
anything. So to my Lord’s, where in the dark W. Howe and I did sing
extemporys, and I find by use that we are able to sing a bass and a
treble pretty well. So home, and to bed.
