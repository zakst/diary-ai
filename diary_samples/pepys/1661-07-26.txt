26th. At home all the morning, and walking met with Mr. Hill of
Cambridge at Pope’s Head Alley with some women with him whom he took and
me into the tavern there, and did give us wine, and would fain seem to
be very knowing in the affairs of state, and tells me that yesterday put
a change to the whole state of England as to the Church; for the King
now would be forced to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him:
but I heed not what he says, though upon enquiry I do find that things
in the Parliament are in a great disorder. Home at noon and there found
Mr. Moore, and with him to an ordinary alone and dined, and there he and
I read my uncle’s will, and I had his opinion on it, and still find
more and more trouble like to attend it. Back to the office all the
afternoon, and that done home for all night. Having the beginning of
this week made a vow to myself to drink no wine this week (finding it to
unfit me to look after business), and this day breaking of it against my
will, I am much troubled for it, but I hope God will forgive me.
