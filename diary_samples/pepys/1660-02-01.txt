February 1st. In the morning went to my office where afterwards the
old man brought me my letters from the carrier. At noon I went home and
dined with my wife on pease porridge and nothing else. After that I
went to the Hall and there met with Mr. Swan and went with him to Mr.
Downing’s Counsellor, who did put me in very little hopes about the
business between Mr. Downing and Squib, and told me that Squib would
carry it against him, at which I was much troubled, and with him went
to Lincoln’s Inn and there spoke with his attorney, who told me the
day that was appointed for the trial. From thence I went to Sir
Harry Wright’s and got him to give me his hand for the L60 which I am
to-morrow to receive from Mr. Calthrop and from thence to Mrs. Jem and
spoke with Madam Scott and her husband who did promise to have the thing
for her neck done this week. Thence home and took Gammer East, and James
the porter, a soldier, to my Lord’s lodgings, who told me how they were
drawn into the field to-day, and that they were ordered to march away
to-morrow to make room for General Monk; but they did shut their Colonel
Fitch, and the rest of the officers out of the field, and swore they
would not go without their money, and if they would not give it them,
they would go where they might have it, and that was the City. So the
Colonel went to the Parliament, and commanded what money could be got,
to be got against to-morrow for them, and all the rest of the soldiers
in town, who in all places made a mutiny this day, and do agree
together. Here I took some bedding to send to Mrs. Ann for her to lie
in now she hath her fits of the ague. Thence I went to Will’s and staid
like a fool there and played at cards till 9 o’clock and so came home,
where I found Mr. Hunt and his wife who staid and sat with me till 10
and so good night.
