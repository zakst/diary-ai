23rd. Up and to my office, where close all the morning about my Lord
Treasurerâ€™s accounts, and at noon home to dinner, and then to the office
all the afternoon very busy till very late at night, and then to supper
and to bed. This evening Mr. Hollyard came to me and told me that he
hath searched my boy, and he finds he hath a stone in his bladder, which
grieves me to the heart, he being a good-natured and well-disposed boy,
and more that it should be my misfortune to have him come to my house.
Sir G. Carteret was here this afternoon; and strange to see how we plot
to make the charge of this warr to appear greater than it is, because of
getting money.
