20th. Up, and to the office, where Mrs. Daniel comes.... All the morning
at the office. Dined at home, then with Mr. Colvill to the new Excise
Office in Aldersgate Street, and thence back to the Old Exchange, to see
a very noble fine lady I spied as I went through, in coming; and there
took occasion to buy some gloves, and admire her, and a mighty fine fair
lady indeed she was. Thence idling all the afternoon to Duck Lane, and
there saw my bookseller’s moher, but get no ground there yet; and here
saw Mrs. Michell’s daughter married newly to a bookseller, and she
proves a comely little grave woman. So to visit my Lord Crew, who is
very sick, to great danger, by an irisipulus;--[Erysipelas.]--the first
day I heard of it, and so home, and took occasion to buy a rest for my
espinette at the ironmonger’s by Holborn Conduit, where the fair pretty
woman is that I have lately observed there, and she is pretty, and je
credo vain enough. Thence home and busy till night, and so to bed.
