17th. Up by five o’clock as I have long done and to my office all the
morning, at noon home to dinner with my father with us. Our dinner, it
being Good Friday, was only sugarsopps and fish; the only time that
we have had a Lenten dinner all this Lent. This morning Mr. Hunt, the
instrument maker, brought me home a Basse Viall to see whether I like
it, which I do not very well, besides I am under a doubt whether I had
best buy one yet or no, because of spoiling my present mind and love to
business. After dinner my father and I walked into the city a little,
and parted and to Paul’s Church Yard, to cause the title of my English
“Mare Clausum”

     [Selden’s work was highly esteemed, and Charles I. made an order in
     council that a copy should be kept in the Council chest, another in
     the Court of Exchequer, and a third in the Court of Admiralty.  The
     book Pepys refers to is Nedham’s translation, which was entitled,
     “Of the Dominion or Ownership of the Sea.  Two Books...,
     written at first in Latin and entituled Mare Clausum, by John
     Selden.  Translated into English by Marchamont Nedham.  London,
