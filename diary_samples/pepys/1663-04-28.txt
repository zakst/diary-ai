28th. Up betimes and to my office, and there all the morning, only
stepped up to see my wife and her dancing master at it, and I think
after all she will do pretty well at it. So to dinner, Mr. Hunt dining
with us, and so to the office, where we sat late, and then I to my
office casting up my Lordâ€™s sea accounts over again, and putting them in
order for payment, and so home to supper and to bed.
