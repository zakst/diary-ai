23rd. St. George’s day and Coronacion, the King and Court being at
Windsor, at the installing of the King of Denmark by proxy and the Duke
of Monmouth. I up betimes, and with my father, having a fire made in my
wife’s new closet above, it being a wet and cold day, we sat there all
the morning looking over his country accounts ever since his going
into the country. I find his spending hitherto has been (without
extraordinary charges) at full L100 per annum, which troubles me, and
I did let him apprehend it, so as that the poor man wept, though he did
make it well appear to me that he could not have saved a farthing of
it. I did tell him how things stand with us, and did shew my distrust of
Pall, both for her good nature and housewifery, which he was sorry for,
telling me that indeed she carries herself very well and carefully,
which I am glad to hear, though I doubt it was but his doting and
not being able to find her miscarriages so well nowadays as he could
heretofore have done. We resolve upon sending for Will Stankes up to
town to give us a right understanding in all that we have in Brampton,
and before my father goes to settle every thing so as to resolve how to
find a living for my father and to pay debts and legacies, and also to
understand truly how Tom’s condition is in the world, that we may know
what we are like to expect of his doing ill or well. So to dinner,
and after dinner to the office, where some of us met and did a little
business, and so to Sir W. Batten’s to see a little picture drawing of
his by a Dutchman which is very well done. So to my office and put a
few things in order, and so home to spend the evening with my father. At
cards till late, and being at supper, my boy being sent for some mustard
to a neat’s tongue, the rogue staid half an hour in the streets, it
seems at a bonfire, at which I was very angry, and resolve to beat him
to-morrow.
