7th. Up in the morning and to my uncle Fenner’s, thinking to have
met Peg Kite about her business but she comes not, so I went to Dr.
Williams, where I found him sick in bed and was sorry for it. So about
business all day, troubled in my mind till I can hear from Brampton, how
things go on at Sturtlow, at the Court, which I was cleared in at night
by a letter, which tells me that my cozen Tom was there to be admitted,
in his father’s name, as heir-at-law, but that he was opposed, and I was
admitted by proxy, which put me out of great trouble of mind.
