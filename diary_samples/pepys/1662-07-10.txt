10th. Up by four o’clock, and before I went to the office I practised my
arithmetique, and then, when my wife was up, did call her and Sarah, and
did make up a difference between them, for she is so good a servant as
I am loth to part with her. So to the office all the morning, where very
much business, but it vexes me to see so much disorder at our table,
that, every man minding a several business, we dispatch nothing. Dined
at home with my wife, then to the office again, and being called by
Sir W. Batten, walked to the Victualler’s office, there to view all the
several offices and houses to see that they were employed in order to
give the Council an account thereof. So after having taken an oath or
two of Mr. Lewes and Captain Brown and others I returned to the office,
and there sat despatching several businesses alone till night, and so
home and by daylight to bed.
