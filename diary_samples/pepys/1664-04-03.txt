3rd (Lordâ€™s day). Being weary last night lay long, and called up by W.
Joyce. So I rose, and his business was to ask advice of me, he being
summonsed to the House of Lords to-morrow, for endeavouring to arrest my
Lady Peters

     [Elizabeth, daughter of John Savage, second Earl Rivers, and first
     wife to William, fourth Lord Petre, who was, in 1678, impeached by
     the Commons of high treason, and died under confinement in the
     Tower, January 5th, 1683, s. p.--B.]

for a debt. I did give him advice, and will assist him. He staid all the
morning, but would not dine with me. So to my office and did business.
At noon home to dinner, and being set with my wife in the kitchen my
father comes and sat down there and dined with us. After dinner gives me
an account of what he had done in his business of his house and goods,
which is almost finished, and he the next week expects to be going down
to Brampton again, which I am glad of because I fear the children of my
Lord that are there for fear of any discontent. He being gone I to my
office, and there very busy setting papers in order till late at night,
only in the afternoon my wife sent for me home, to see her new laced
gowne, that is her gown that is new laced; and indeed it becomes her
very nobly, and is well made. I am much pleased with it. At night to
supper, prayers, and to bed.
