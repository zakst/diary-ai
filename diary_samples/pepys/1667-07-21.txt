21st (Lord’s day). Up betimes, and all the morning, and then to dinner
with my wife alone, and then all the afternoon in like manner, in my
chamber, making up my Tangier accounts and drawing a letter, which
I have done at last to my full content, to present to the Lords
Commissioners for Tangier tomorrow; and about seven at night, when
finished my letter and weary, I and my wife and Mercer up by water to
Barne Elmes, where we walked by moonshine, and called at Lambeth, and
drank and had cold meat in the boat, and did eat, and sang, and down
home, by almost twelve at night, very fine and pleasant, only could not
sing ordinary songs with the freedom that otherwise I would. Here Mercer
tells me that the pretty maid of the Ship tavern I spoke of yesterday is
married there, which I am glad of. So having spent this night, with much
serious pleasure to consider that I am in a condition to fling away an
angell

     [The angel coin was so called from the figure of the Archangel
     Michael in conflict with the dragon on the obverse.  On the reverse
     was a representation of a ship with a large cross as a mast.  The
     last angel coined was in Charles I.’s reign, and the value varied
     from 6s. 8d. to 10s.]

in such a refreshment to myself and family, we home and to bed, leaving
Mercer, by the way, at her own door.
