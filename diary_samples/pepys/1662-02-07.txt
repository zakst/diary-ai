7th. Among my workmen this morning. By and by by water to Westminster
with Commissioner Pett (landing my wife at Black Friars) where I
hear the prisoners in the Tower that are to die are come to the
Parliament-house this morning. To the Wardrobe to dinner with my Lady;
where a civitt cat, parrot, apes, and many other things are come from my
Lord by Captain Hill, who dined with my Lady with us to-day. Thence to
the Paynterâ€™s, and am well pleased with our pictures. So by coach
home, where I found the joyners putting up my chimney-piece in the
dining-room, which pleases me well, only the frame for a picture they
have made so massy and heavy that I cannot tell what to do with it. This
evening came my she cozen Porter to see us (the first time that we had
seen her since we came to this end of the town) and after her Mr. Hart,
who both staid with us a pretty while and so went away. By and by,
hearing that Mr. Turner was much troubled at what I do in the office,
and do give ill words to Sir W. Pen and others of me, I am much troubled
in my mind, and so went to bed; not that I fear him at all, but the
natural aptness I have to be troubled at any thing that crosses me.
