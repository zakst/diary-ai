18th. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning; at noon to the
‘Change, and thence to the Royall Oake taverne in Lumbard Streete,
where Sir William Petty and the owners of the double-bottomed boat (the
Experiment) did entertain my Lord Brunkard, Sir R. Murrey, myself, and
others, with marrow bones and a chine of beefe of the victuals they have
made for this ship; and excellent company and good discourse: but,
above all, I do value Sir William Petty. Thence home; and took my Lord
Sandwich’s draught of the harbour of Portsmouth down to Ratcliffe, to
one Burston, to make a plate for the King, and another for the Duke, and
another for himself; which will be very neat. So home, and till almost
one o’clock in the morning at my office, and then home to supper and
to bed. My Lord Sandwich, and his fleete of twenty-five ships in the
Downes, returned from cruising, but could not meet with any Dutchmen.
