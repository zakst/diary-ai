8th (Lord’s day). In bed all the morning thinking to take physique,
but it being a frost my wife would not have me. So to dinner at the
Wardrobe, and after a great deal of good discourse with my Lady after
dinner, and among other things of the great christening yesterday at Mr.
Rumbell’s, and courtiers and pomp that was there, which I wonder at, I
went away up and down into all the churches almost between that place
and my house, and so home. And then came my brother Tom, and staid and
talked with me, and I hope he will do very well and get money. So
to supper and to bed. This morning as I was in bed, one brings me T.
Trice’s answer to my bill in chancery from Mr. Smallwood, which I am
glad to see, though I am afraid it will do me hurt.
