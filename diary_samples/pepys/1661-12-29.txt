29th (Lord’s day). Long in bed with my wife, and though I had determined
to go to dine with my wife at my Lady’s, (chiefly to put off dining with
Sir W. Pen to-day because Holmes dined there), yet I could not get a
coach time enough to go thither, and so I dined at home, and my brother
Tom with me, and then a coach came and I carried my wife to Westminster,
and she went to see Mrs. Hunt, and I to the Abbey, and there meeting
with Mr. Hooper, he took me in among the quire, and there I sang with
them their service, and so that being done, I walked up and down till
night for that Mr. Coventry was not come to Whitehall since dinner
again. At last I went thither and he was come, and I spoke with him
about some business of the office, and so took leave of him, and sent
for my wife and the coach, and so to the Wardrobe and supped, and staid
very long talking with my Lady, who seems to doat every day more and
more upon us. So home and to prayers, and to bed.
