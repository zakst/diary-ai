30th (Whitsunday). By water to White Hall, and thence to Sir W.
Coventry, where all the morning by his bed-side, he being indisposed.
Our discourse was upon the notes I have lately prepared for Commandersâ€™
Instructions; but concluded that nothing will render them effectual,
without an amendment in the choice of them, that they be seamen, and not
gentleman above the command of the Admiral, by the greatness of their
relations at Court. Thence to White Hall, and dined alone with Mr.
Chevins his sister: whither by and by come in Mr. Progers and Sir Thomas
Allen, and by and by fine Mrs. Wells, who is a great beauty; and there
I had my full gaze upon her, to my great content, she being a woman of
pretty conversation. Thence to the Duke of York, who, with the officers
of the Navy, made a good entrance on my draught of my new Instructions
to Commanders, as well expressing general [views] of a reformation among
them, as liking of my humble offers towards it. Thence being called
by my wife, Mr. Gibson and I, we to the Park, whence the rain suddenly
home.
