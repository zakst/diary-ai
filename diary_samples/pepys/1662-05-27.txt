27th. To my Lord this morning, and thence to my brother’s, where I found
my father, poor man, come, which I was glad to see. I staid with him
till noon, and then he went to my cozen Scott’s to dinner, who had
invited him. He tells me his alterations of the house and garden at
Brampton, which please me well. I could not go with him, and so we
parted at Ludgate, and I home to dinner, and to the office all the
afternoon, and musique in my chamber alone at night, and so to bed.
