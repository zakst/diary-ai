6th. At the office sat all the morning, where, in the absence of Sir W.
Batten, Sir G. Carteret being angry about the business of tickets, spoke
of Sir W. Batten for speaking some words about the signing of tickets,
and called Sir W. Batten in his discourse at the table to us (the
clerks being withdrawn) “shitten foole,” which vexed me. At noon to the
‘Change, and there set my business of lighters’ buying for the King, to
Sir W. Warren, and I think he will do it for me to very great advantage,
at which I am mightily rejoiced. Home and after a mouthfull of dinner to
the office, where till 6 o’clock, and then to White Hall, and there
with Sir G. Carteret and my Lord Brunkerd attended the Duke of Albemarle
about the business of money. I also went to Jervas’s, my barber, for my
periwigg that was mending there, and there do hear that Jane is quite
undone, taking the idle fellow for her husband yet not married, and lay
with him several weeks that had another wife and child, and she is now
going into Ireland. So called my wife at the ‘Change and home, and at my
office writing letters till one o’clock in the morning, that I was
ready to fall down asleep again. Great talke of a new Comett; and it is
certain one do now appear as bright as the late one at the best; but I
have not seen it myself.
