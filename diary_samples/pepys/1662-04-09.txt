9th. At my office betimes, and by and by we sat, and at noon Mr.
Coventry, Sir J. Minnes, Mr. Pett, and myself by water to Deptford,
where we met Sir G. C., Sir W. B., and Sir W. P. At the pay of a ship,
and we dined together on a haunch of good venison boiled, and after
dinner returned again to the office, and there met several tradesmen by
our appointment to know of them their lowest rates that they will take
for their several provisions that they sell to us, for I do resolve to
know that, and to buy no dearer, that so when we know the lowest rate,
it shall be the Treasurer’s fault, and not ours, that we pay dearer.
This afternoon Sir John Minnes, Mr. Coventry, and I went into Sir John’s
lodgings, where he showed us how I have blinded all his lights, and
stopped up his garden door, and other things he takes notice of that
he resolves to abridge me of, which do vex me so much that for all this
evening and all night in my bed, so great a fool I am, and little master
of my passion, that I could not sleep for the thoughts of my losing the
privilege of the leads, and other things which in themselves are small
and not worth half the trouble. The more fool am I, and must labour
against it for shame, especially I that used to preach up Epictetus’s
rule:

     [“Some things are in our power, others are not” Pepys means,
     “I ought not to vex myself about what I cannot control.”]

Late at my office, troubled in mind, and then to bed, but could hardly
sleep at night.
