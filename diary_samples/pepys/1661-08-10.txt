10th. This morning came the maid that my wife hath lately hired for
a chamber maid. She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but
otherwise she seems very good. But however she do come about three weeks
hence, when my wife comes back from Brampton, if she go with my father.
By and by came my father to my house, and so he and I went and found out
my uncle Wight at the Coffee House, and there did agree with him to
meet the next week with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain’s will
before them both for their satisfaction. Having done with him I went
to my Lady’s and dined with her, and after dinner took the two young
gentlemen and the two ladies and carried them and Captain Ferrers to the
Theatre, and shewed them “The merry Devill of Edmunton,” which is a very
merry play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well. And
that being done I took them all home by coach to my house and there
gave them fruit to eat and wine. So by water home with them, and so home
myself.
