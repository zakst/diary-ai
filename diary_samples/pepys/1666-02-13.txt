13th. Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon to the ‘Change, and
thence after business dined at the Sheriffe’s [Hooker], being carried by
Mr. Lethulier, where to my heart’s content I met with his wife, a most
beautifull fat woman. But all the house melancholy upon the sickness of
a daughter of the house in childbed, Mr. Vaughan’s lady. So all of them
undressed, but however this lady a very fine woman. I had a salute of
her, and after dinner some discourse the Sheriffe and I about a parcel
of tallow I am buying for the office of him. I away home, and there at
the office all the afternoon till late at night, and then away home to
supper and to bed. Ill newes this night that the plague is encreased
this week, and in many places else about the towne, and at Chatham and
elsewhere. This day my wife wanting a chambermaid with much ado got our
old little Jane to be found out, who come to see her and hath lived
all this while in one place, but is so well that we will not desire her
removal, but are mighty glad to see the poor wench, who is very well and
do well.
