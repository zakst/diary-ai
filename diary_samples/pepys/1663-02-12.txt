12 at night. Now as my mind was but very ill satisfied with these two
plays themselves, so was I in the midst of them sad to think of the
spending so much money and venturing upon the breach of my vow, which
I found myself sorry for, I bless God, though my nature would well be
contented to follow the pleasure still. But I did make payment of my
forfeiture presently, though I hope to save it back again by forbearing
two plays at Court for this one at the Theatre, or else to forbear that
to the Theatre which I am to have at Easter. But it being my birthday
and my day of liberty regained to me, and lastly, the last play that is
likely to be acted at Court before Easter, because of the Lent coming
in, I was the easier content to fling away so much money. So to bed.
This day I was told that my Lady Castlemaine hath all the Kingâ€™s
Christmas presents, made him by the peers, given to her, which is a
most abominable thing; and that at the great ball she was much richer in
jewells than the Queen and Duchess put both together.
