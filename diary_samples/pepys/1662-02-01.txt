February 1st. This morning within till 11 o’clock, and then with
Commissioner Pett to the office; and he staid there writing, while I and
Sir W. Pen walked in the garden talking about his business of putting
his son to Cambridge; and to that end I intend to write to-night to Dr.
Fairebrother, to give me an account of Mr. Burton of Magdalene. Thence
with Mr. Pett to the Paynter’s; and he likes our pictures very well, and
so do I. Thence he and I to the Countess of Sandwich, to lead him to her
to kiss her hands: and dined with her, and told her the news (which Sir
W. Pen told me to-day) that express is come from my Lord with letters,
that by a great storm and tempest the mole of Argier is broken down, and
many of their ships sunk into the mole. So that God Almighty hath now
ended that unlucky business for us; which is very good news. After
dinner to the office, where we staid late, and so I home, and late
writing letters to my father and Dr. Fairebrother, and an angry letter
to my brother John for not writing to me, and so to bed.
