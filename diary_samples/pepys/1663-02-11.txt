11th. Took a clyster in the morning and rose in the afternoon. My wife
and I dined on a pullet and I eat heartily, having eat nothing since
Sunday but water gruel and posset drink, but must needs say that our new
maid Mary has played her part very well in her readiness and discretion
in attending me, of which I am very glad. In the afternoon several
people came to see me, my uncle Thomas, Mr. Creed, Sir J. Minnes (who
has been, God knows to what end, mighty kind to me and careful of me in
my sickness). At night my wife read Sir H. Vaneâ€™s tryall to me, which
she began last night, and I find it a very excellent thing, worth
reading, and him to have been a very wise man. So to supper and to bed.
