5th. This morning the Proposal which I wrote the last night I showed to
the officers this morning, and was well liked of, and I wrote it fair
for Sir. G. Carteret to show to the King, and so it is to go to the
Parliament. I dined at home, and after dinner I went to the new Theatre
and there I saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor” acted, the humours of the
country gentleman and the French doctor very well done, but the rest but
very poorly, and Sir J. Falstaffe t as bad as any. From thence to Mr.
Will. Montagu’s chamber to have sealed some writings tonight between Sir
R. Parkhurst and myself about my Lord’s L2000, but he not coming, I went
to my father’s and there found my mother still ill of the stone, and
had just newly voided one, which she had let drop into the chimney, and
looked and found it to shew it me. From thence home and to bed.
