16th (Lordâ€™s day). All the morning at my Office with W. Hewer, there
drawing up my Report to the Duke of York, as I have promised, about
the faults of this Office, hoping thereby to have opportunity of doing
myself [something]. At noon to dinner, and again with him to work all
the afternoon till night, till I was weary and had despatched a good
deal of business, and so to bed after hearing my wife read a little.
