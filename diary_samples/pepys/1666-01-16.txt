16th. Up, and leaving the women in bed together (a pretty black and
white) I to London to the office, and there forgot, through business, to
bespeake any dinner for my wife and Mrs. Pierce. However, by noon they
come, and a dinner we had, and Kate Joyce comes to see us, with whom
very merry. After dinner she and I up to my chamber, who told me her
business was chiefly for my advice about her husband’s leaving off his
trade, which though I wish enough, yet I did advise against, for he is
a man will not know how to live idle, and employment he is fit for none.
Thence anon carried her and Mrs. Pierce home, and so to the Duke of
Albemarle, and mighty kind he to me still. So home late at my letters,
and so to bed, being mightily troubled at the newes of the plague’s
being encreased, and was much the saddest news that the plague hath
brought me from the beginning of it; because of the lateness of the
year, and the fear, we may with reason have, of its continuing with us
the next summer. The total being now 375, and the plague 158.
