10th. Up, and to the office, and there busy sitting till noon. I find at
home Mrs. Pierce and Knipp come to dine with me. We were mighty merry;
and, after dinner, I carried them and my wife out by coach to the New
Exchange, and there I did give my valentine, Mrs. Pierce, a dozen payre
of gloves, and a payre of silke stockings, and Knipp for company’s sake,
though my wife had, by my consent, laid out 20s. upon her the other day,
six payre of gloves. Thence to Hales’s to have seen our pictures, but
could not get in, he being abroad, and so to the Cakehouse hard by, and
there sat in the coach with great pleasure, and eat some fine cakes and
so carried them to Pierces and away home. It is a mighty fine witty
boy, Mrs. Pierces little boy. Thence home and to the office, where late
writing letters and leaving a great deale to do on Monday, I home to
supper and to bed. The truth is, I do indulge myself a little the more
in pleasure, knowing that this is the proper age of my life to do it;
and out of my observation that most men that do thrive in the world,
do forget to take pleasure during the time that they are getting their
estate, but reserve that till they have got one, and then it is too late
for them to enjoy it with any pleasure.
