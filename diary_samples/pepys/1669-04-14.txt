14th. Up, and with W. Hewer to White Hall, and there I did speak with
the Duke of York, the Council sitting in the morning, and it was to
direct me to have my business ready of the Administration of the Office
against Saturday next, when the King would have a hearing of it. Thence
home, W. Hewer with me, and then out with my own coach to the Duke
of York’s play-house, and there saw “The Impertinents,” a play which
pleases me well still; but it is with great trouble that I now see
a play, because of my eyes, the light of the candles making it very
troublesome to me. After the play; my wife and I towards the Park, but
it being too late we to Creed’s, and there find him and her [his wife]
together alone, in their new house, where I never was before, they
lodging before at the next door, and a pretty house it is; but I do
not see that they intend to keep any coach. Here they treat us like
strangers, quite according to the fashion--nothing to drink or eat,
which is a thing that will spoil our ever having any acquaintance with
them; for we do continue the old freedom and kindness of England to all
our friends. But they do here talk mightily of my Lady Paulina making a
very good end, and being mighty religious in her lifetime; and hath left
many good notes of sermons and religion; wrote with her own hand, hand,
which nobody ever knew of; which I am glad of: but she was always a
peevish lady. Thence home, and there to talk and to supper and to bed,
all being very safe as to my seeing of poor Deb. yesterday.
