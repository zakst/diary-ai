31st (Lord’s day). All the morning in my chamber, writing fair the state
of my Tangier accounts, and so dined at home. In the afternoon to the
Duke of Albemarle and thence back again by water, and so to my chamber
to finish the entry of my accounts and to think of the business I am
next to do, which is the stating my thoughts and putting in order my
collections about the business of pursers, to see where the fault of our
present constitution relating to them lies and what to propose to mend
it, and upon this late and with my head full of this business to bed.
Thus ends this year, to my great joy, in this manner. I have raised
my estate from L1300 in this year to L4400. I have got myself greater
interest, I think, by my diligence, and my employments encreased by that
of Treasurer for Tangier, and Surveyour of the Victualls. It is true we
have gone through great melancholy because of the great plague, and I
put to great charges by it, by keeping my family long at Woolwich,
and myself and another part of my family, my clerks, at my charge at
Greenwich, and a mayde at London; but I hope the King will give us some
satisfaction for that. But now the plague is abated almost to nothing,
and I intending to get to London as fast as I can. My family, that is
my wife and maids, having been there these two or three weeks. The Dutch
war goes on very ill, by reason of lack of money; having none to
hope for, all being put into disorder by a new Act that is made as an
experiment to bring credit to the Exchequer, for goods and money to
be advanced upon the credit of that Act. I have never lived so merrily
(besides that I never got so much) as I have done this plague time,
by my Lord Bruncker’s and Captain Cocke’s good company, and the
acquaintance of Mrs. Knipp, Coleman and her husband, and Mr. Laneare,
and great store of dancings we have had at my cost (which I was willing
to indulge myself and wife) at my lodgings. The great evil of this
year, and the only one indeed, is the fall of my Lord of Sandwich, whose
mistake about the prizes hath undone him, I believe, as to interest at
Court; though sent (for a little palliating it) Embassador into Spayne,
which he is now fitting himself for. But the Duke of Albemarle goes with
the Prince to sea this next year, and my Lord very meanly spoken of;
and, indeed, his miscarriage about the prize goods is not to be excused,
to suffer a company of rogues to go away with ten times as much as
himself, and the blame of all to be deservedly laid upon him.

     [According to Granville Penn (“Memorials of Sir W. Penn,” ii. 488 n.)
     L2000 went to Lord Sandwich and L8000 among eight others.]

My whole family hath been well all this while, and all my friends I
know of, saving my aunt Bell, who is dead, and some children of my cozen
Sarah’s, of the plague. But many of such as I know very well, dead;
yet, to our great joy, the town fills apace, and shops begin to be open
again. Pray God continue the plague’s decrease! for that keeps the Court
away from the place of business, and so all goes to rack as to publick
matters, they at this distance not thinking of it.
