17th (Lord’s day). A most tedious, unreasonable, and impertinent sermon,
by an Irish Doctor. His text was “Scatter them, O Lord, that delight in
war.” Sir Wm. Batten and I very much angry with the parson. And so I to
Westminster as soon as I came home to my Lord’s, where I dined with
Mr. Shepley and Howe. After dinner (without speaking to my Lord), Mr.
Shepley and I into the city, and so I home and took my wife to my uncle
Wight’s, and there did sup with them, and so home again and to bed.
