2nd. All this morning at Pegg Kite’s with my uncle Fenner, and two
friends of his, appraising her goods that her mother has left; but
the slut is like to prove so troublesome that I am out of heart with
troubling myself in her business. After we had done we all went to a
cook’s shop in Bishopsgate Street and dined, and then I took them to the
tavern and did give them a quart of sack, and so parted. I home and then
took my wife out, and in a coach of a gentlewoman’s that had been to
visit my Lady Batten and was going home again our way, we went to the
Theatre, but coming late, and sitting in an ill place, I never had so
little pleasure in a play in my life, yet it was the first time that
ever I saw it, “Victoria Corombona.” Methinks a very poor play. Then at
night troubled to get my wife home, it being very dark, and so we were
forced to have a coach. So to supper and to bed.
