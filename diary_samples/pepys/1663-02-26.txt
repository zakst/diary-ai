26th. Up and drinking a draft of wormewood wine with Sir W. Batten at
the Steelyard, he and I by water to the Parliament-house: he went
in, and I walked up and down the Hall. All the news is the great odds
yesterday in the votes between them that are for the Indulgence to the
Papists and Presbyters, and those that are against it, which did carry
it by 200 against 30. And pretty it is to consider how the King would
appear to be a stiff Protestant and son of the Church; and yet would
appear willing to give a liberty to these people, because of his promise
at Breda. And yet all the world do believe that the King would not have
this liberty given them at all. Thence to my Lord’s, who, I hear, has
his ague again, for which I am sorry, and Creed and I to the King’s Head
ordinary, where much good company. Among the rest a young gallant lately
come from France, who was full of his French, but methought not very
good, but he had enough to make him think himself a wise man a great
while. Thence by water from the New Exchange home to the Tower, and so
sat at the office, and then writing letters till 11 at night. Troubled
this evening that my wife is not come home from Chelsey, whither she
is gone to see the play at the school where Ashwell is, but she came
at last, it seems, by water, and tells me she is much pleased with
Ashwell’s acting and carriage, which I am glad of. So home and to supper
and bed.
