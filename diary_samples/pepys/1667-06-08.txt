8th. Up, and to the office, where all the news this morning is, that the
Dutch are come with a fleete of eighty sail to Harwich, and that
guns were heard plain by Sir W. Riderâ€™s people at Bednallgreene, all
yesterday even. So to the office, we all sat all the morning, and then
home to dinner, where our dinner a ham of French bacon, boiled with
pigeons, an excellent dish. Here dined with us only W. Hewer and his
mother. After dinner to the office again, where busy till night, and
then home and to read a little and then to bed. The news is confirmed
that the Dutch are off of Harwich, but had done nothing last night. The
King hath sent down my Lord of Oxford to raise the countries there; and
all the Westerne barges are taken up to make a bridge over the River,
about the Hope, for horse to cross the River, if there be occasion.
