23rd. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, and at noon home to
dinner, and all the afternoon also busy till late preparing things to
fortify myself and fellows against the Parliament; and particularly
myself against what I fear is thought, that I have suppressed the Order
of the Board by which the discharging the great ships off at Chatham by
tickets was directed; whereas, indeed, there was no such Order. So home
at night to supper and to bed.
