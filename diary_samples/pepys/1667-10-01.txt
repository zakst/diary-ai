October 1st. All the morning busy at the office, pleased mightily with
my girle that we have got to wait on my wife. At noon dined with Sir G.
Carteret and the rest of our officers at his house in Broad Street, they
being there upon his accounts. After dinner took coach and to my wife,
who was gone before into the Strand, there to buy a nightgown, where
I found her in a shop with her pretty girle, and having bought it away
home, and I thence to Sir G. Carteretâ€™s again, and so took coach
alone, it now being almost night, to White Hall, and there in the
Boarded-gallery did hear the musick with which the King is presented
this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his musick; both
instrumentall--I think twenty-four violins--and vocall; an English song
upon Peace. But, God forgive me! I never was so little pleased with
a concert of musick in my life. The manner of setting of words and
repeating them out of order, and that with a number of voices, makes
me sick, the whole design of vocall musick being lost by it. Here was a
great press of people; but I did not see many pleased with it, only the
instrumental musick he had brought by practice to play very just. So
thence late in the dark round by the wall home by coach, and there to
sing and sup with my wife, and look upon our pretty girle, and so to
bed.
