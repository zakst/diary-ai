6th. Col. Slingsby and I at the office getting a catch ready for the
Prince de Ligne to carry his things away to-day, who is now going home
again. About noon comes my cozen H. Alcock, for whom I brought a letter
for my Lord to sign to my Lord Broghill for some preferment in Ireland,
whither he is now a-going. After him comes Mr. Creed, who brought me
some books from Holland with him, well bound and good books, which I
thought he did intend to give me, but I found that I must pay him. He
dined with me at my house, and from thence to Whitehall together, where
I was to give my Lord an account of the stations and victualls of the
fleet in order to the choosing of a fleet fit for him to take to sea,
to bring over the Queen, but my Lord not coming in before 9 at night I
staid no longer for him, but went back again home and so to bed.
