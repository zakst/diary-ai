28th. I observe that Will, whom I used to call two or three times in
a morning, would now wake of himself and rise without calling. Which
though angry I was glad to see. So I rose and among my workmen, in my
gown, without a doublet, an hour or two or more, till I was afraid of
getting an ague, and so to the office, and there we sat all the morning,
and at noon Mr. Coventry and I dined at Sir W. Battenâ€™s, where I have
now dined three days together, and so in the afternoon again we sat,
which we intend to do two afternoons in a week besides our other
sitting. In the evening we rose, and I to see how my work goes on, and
so to my office, writing by the post and doing other matters, and so
home and to bed late.
