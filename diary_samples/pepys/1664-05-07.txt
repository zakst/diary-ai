7th. Betimes at my office with the joyners, and giving order for other
things about it. By and by we sat all the morning. At noon to dinner,
and after dinner comes Deane of Woolwich, and I spent, as I had
appointed, all the afternoon with him about instructions which he
gives me to understand the building of a ship, and I think I shall soon
understand it. In the evening a little to my office to see how the work
goes forward there, and then home and spent the evening also with Mr.
Deane, and had a good supper, and then to bed, he lying at my house.
