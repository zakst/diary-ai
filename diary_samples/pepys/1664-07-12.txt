12th. And so rose, called up by my Lord Peterborough’s gentleman about
getting his Lord’s money to-day of Mr. Povy, wherein I took such order,
that it was paid, and I had my L50 brought me, which comforts my heart.
We sat at the office all the morning, then at home. Dined alone; sad for
want of company and not being very well, and know not how to eat alone.
After dinner down with Sir G. Carteret, Sir J. Minnes, and Sir W. Batten
to view, and did like a place by Deptford yard to lay masts in. By
and by comes Mr. Coventry, and after a little stay he and I down to
Blackwall, he having a mind to see the yarde, which we did, and fine
storehouses there are and good docks, but of no great profit to him that
oweth them for ought we see.

     [For “owneth.”  This sense is very common in Shakespeare.  In the
     original edition of the authorized version of the Bible we read: “So
     shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that oweth this girdle”
      (Acts xxi.  I i) Nares’s Glossary.]

So home by water with him, having good discourse by the way, and so I to
the office a while, and late home to supper and to bed.
