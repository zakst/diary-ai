12th. Though it was an office day, yet I was forced to go to the Privy
Seal, at which I was all the morning, and from thence to my Lady’s to
dinner at the Wardrobe; and in my way upon the Thames, I saw the King’s
new pleasure-boat that is come now for the King to take pleasure in
above bridge; and also two Gundaloes

     [“Two long boats that were made in Venice, called gondolas, were by
     the Duke of Venice (Dominico Contareni) presented to His Majesty;
     and the attending watermen, being four, were in very rich clothes,
     crimson satin; very big were their breeches and doublets; they wore
     also very large shirts of the same satin, very richly laced.”

that are lately brought, which are very rich and fine. After dinner
I went into my Lady’s chamber where I found her up now out of her
childbed, which I was glad to see, and after an hour’s talk with her I
took leave and to Tom Trice again, and sat talking and drinking with him
about our business a great while. I do find I am likely to be forced to
pay interest for the L200. By and by in comes my uncle Thomas, and as he
was always a close cunning fellow, so he carries himself to me, and says
nothing of what his endeavours are, though to my trouble I know that he
is about recovering of Gravely, but neither I nor he began any discourse
of the business. From thence to Dr. Williams (at the little blind
alehouse in Shoe Lane, at the Gridiron, a place I am ashamed to be seen
to go into), and there with some bland counsel of his we discuss our
matters, but I find men of so different minds that by my troth I know
not what to trust to. It being late I took leave, and by link home and
called at Sir W. Batten’s, and there hear that Sir W. Pen do take our
jest of the tankard very ill, which Pam sorry for.
