8th. All the morning busy. After dinner come several persons of honour,
as my Lord St. John and others, for convoy to Flushing, and great giving
of them salutes. My Lord and we at nine-pins: I lost 9s. While we were
at play Mr. Cook brings me word of my wife. He went to Huntsmore to see
her, and brought her and my father Bowyer to London, where he left her
at my father’s, very well, and speaks very well of her love to me.
My letters to-day tell me how it was intended that the King should be
proclaimed to-day in London, with a great deal of pomp. I had also news
who they are that are chosen of the Lords and Commons to attend the
King. And also the whole story of what we did the other day in the
fleet, at reading of the King’s declaration, and my name at the bottom
of it. After supper some musique and to bed. I resolving to rise betimes
to-morrow to write letters to London.
