8th. Up, and to White Hall, to the King’s side, to find Sir T. Clifford,
where the Duke of York come and found me, which I was sorry for, for
fear he should think I was making friends on that side. But I did put it
off the best I could, my being there: and so, by and by, had opportunity
alone to shew Sir T. Clifford the fair account I had drawn up of the
Customes, which he liked, and seemed mightily pleased with me; and so
away to the Excise-Office, to do a little business there, and so to the
Office, where all the morning. At noon home to dinner, and then to
the office again till the evening, and then with my wife by coach to
Islington, to pay what we owe there, for the late dinner at Jane’s
wedding; and so round by Kingsland and Hogsden home, pleased with my
wife’s singing with me, by the way, and so to the office again a
little, and then home to supper and to bed. Going this afternoon through
Smithfield, I did see a coach run over the coachman’s neck, and stand
upon it, and yet the man rose up, and was well after it, which I thought
a wonder.
