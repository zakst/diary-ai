30th. All the morning at the office; at noon to the â€˜Change, where great
talke of a rich present brought by an East India ship from some of the
Princes of India, worth to the King L70,000 in two precious stones.
After dinner to the office, and there all the afternoon making an end
of several things against the end of the month, that I may clear all my
reckonings tomorrow; also this afternoon, with great content, I finished
the contracts for victualling of Tangier with Mr. Lanyon and the rest,
and to my comfort got him and Andrews to sign to the giving me L300 per
annum, by which, at least, I hope to be a L100 or two the better. Wrote
many letters by the post to ease my mind of business and to clear my
paper of minutes, as I did lately oblige myself to clear every thing
against the end of the month. So at night with my mind quiet and
contented to bed. This day I sent a side of venison and six bottles of
wine to Kate Joyce.
