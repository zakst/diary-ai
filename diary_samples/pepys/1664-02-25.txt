25th. Up and to the office, where we sat, and thence with Mr. Coventry
by coach to the glasshouse and there dined, and both before and after
did my Lord Peterborough’s accounts. Thence home to the office, and
there did business till called by Creed, and with him by coach (setting
my wife at my brother’s) to my Lord’s, and saw the young ladies, and
talked a little with them, and thence to White Hall, a while talking
but doing no business, but resolved of going to meet my Lord tomorrow,
having got a horse of Mr. Coventry to-day. So home, taking up my wife,
and after doing something at my office home, God forgive me, disturbed
in my mind out of my jealousy of my wife tomorrow when I am out of town,
which is a hell to my mind, and yet without all reason. God forgive me
for it, and mend me. So home, and getting my things ready for me, weary
to bed.
