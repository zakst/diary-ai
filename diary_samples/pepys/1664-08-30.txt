30th. Up and to the office, where sat long, and at noon to dinner at
home; after dinner comes Mr. Pen to visit me, and staid an houre talking
with me. I perceive something of learning he hath got, but a great
deale, if not too much, of the vanity of the French garbe and affected
manner of speech and gait. I fear all real profit he hath made of his
travel will signify little. So, he gone, I to my office and there very
busy till late at night, and so home to supper and to bed.
