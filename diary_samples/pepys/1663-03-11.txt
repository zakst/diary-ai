11th. Up betimes, and to my office, walked a little in the garden with
Sir W. Batten, talking about the difference between his Lady and my wife
yesterday, and I doubt my wife is to blame. About noon had news by Mr.
Wood that Butler, our chief witness against Field, was sent by him to
New England contrary to our desire, which made me mad almost; and so
Sir J. Minnes, Sir W. Pen, and I dined together at Trinity House, and
thither sent for him to us and told him our minds, which he seemed not
to value much, but went away. I wrote and sent an express to Walthamstow
to Sir W. Pen, who is gone thither this morning, to tell him of it.
However, in the afternoon Wood sends us word that he has appointed
another to go, who shall overtake the ship in the Downes. So I was
late at the office, among other things writing to the Downes, to the
Commander-in-Chief, and putting things into the surest course I could to
help the business. So home and to bed.
