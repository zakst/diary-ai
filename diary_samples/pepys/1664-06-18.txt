18th. From morning till 11 at night (only a little at dinner at home)
at my office very busy, setting many businesses in order to my great
trouble, but great content in the end. So home to supper and to bed.
Strange to see how pert Sir W. Pen is to-day newly come from Portsmouth
with his head full of great reports of his service and the state of the
ships there. When that is over he will be just as another man again or
worse. But I wonder whence Mr. Coventry should take all this care for
him, to send for him up only to look after his Irish business with my
Lord Ormond and to get the Dukeâ€™s leave for him to come with so much
officiousness, when I am sure he knows him as well as I do as to his
little service he do.
