19th. A great deal of business all this day, and Burr being gone to
shore without my leave did vex me much. At dinner news was brought us
that my Lord was chosen at Dover. This afternoon came one Mr. Mansell on
board as a Reformado, to whom my Lord did shew exceeding great respect,
but upon what account I do not yet know. This day it has rained much, so
that when I came to go to bed I found it wet through, so I was fain to
wrap myself up in a dry sheet, and so lay all night.
