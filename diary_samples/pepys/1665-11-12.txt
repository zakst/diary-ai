12th (Lord’s day). Up, and invited by Captain Cocke to dinner. So after
being ready I went to him, and there he and I and Mr. Yard (one of the
Guinny Company) dined together and very merry. After dinner I by water
to the Duke of Albemarle, and there had a little discourse and business
with him, chiefly to receive his commands about pilotts to be got for
our Hambro’ ships, going now at this time of the year convoy to the
merchant ships, that have lain at great pain and charge, some three,
some four months at Harwich for a convoy. They hope here the plague will
be less this weeke. Thence back by water to Captain Cocke’s, and there
he and I spent a great deale of the evening as we had done of the day
reading and discoursing over part of Mr. Stillingfleet’s “Origines
Sacrae,” wherein many things are very good and some frivolous. Thence by
and by he and I to Mrs. Penington’s, but she was gone to bed. So we back
and walked a while, and then to his house and to supper, and then broke
up, and I home to my lodging to bed.
