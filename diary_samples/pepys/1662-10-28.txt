28th (Lord’s day). Up and, with my wife to church, and coming out, went
out both before my Lady Batten, he not being there, which I believe
will vex her. After dinner my wife to church again, and I to the French
church, where I heard an old man make a tedious, long sermon, till they
were fain to light candles to baptize the children by. So homewards,
meeting my brother Tom, but spoke but little with him, and calling also
at my uncle Wight’s, but met him and her going forth, and so I went
directly home, and there fell to the renewing my last year’s oaths,
whereby it has pleased God so much to better myself and practise, and so
down to supper, and then prayers and bed.
