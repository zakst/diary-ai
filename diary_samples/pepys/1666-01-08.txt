8th. Up, and my wife and I by coach to Bennett’s, in Paternoster Row,
few shops there being yet open, and there bought velvett for a coate,
and camelott for a cloake for myself; and thence to a place to look over
some fine counterfeit damasks to hang my wife’s closett, and pitched
upon one, and so by coach home again, I calling at the ‘Change, and so
home to dinner and all the afternoon look after my papers at home and
my office against to-morrow, and so after supper and considering the
uselessness of laying out so much money upon my wife’s closett, but only
the chamber, to bed.
