11th (Lord’s day). Lay long talking pleasant with my wife, then up and
to church, the pew being quite full with strangers come along with Sir
W. Batten and Sir J. Minnes, so after a pitifull sermon of the
young Scott, home to dinner. After dinner comes a footman of my Lord
Sandwich’s (my Lord being come to town last night) with a letter from my
father, in which he presses me to carry on the business for Tom with his
late mistress, which I am sorry to see my father do, it being so much
out of our power or for his advantage, as it is clear to me it is,
which I shall think of and answer in my next. So to my office all the
afternoon writing orders myself to have ready against to-morrow, that
I might not appear negligent to Mr. Coventry. In the evening to Sir W.
Pen’s, where Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Batten, and afterwards came Sir
G. Carteret. There talked about business, and afterwards to Sir W.
Batten’s, where we staid talking and drinking Syder, and so I went away
to my office a little, and so home and to bed.
