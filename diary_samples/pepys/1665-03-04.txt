4th. Up very betimes, and walked, it being bitter cold, to Ratcliffe,
to the plate-maker’s and back again. To the office, where we sat all the
morning, I, with being empty and full of ayre and wind, had some pain
to-day. Dined alone at home, my wife being gone abroad to buy some more
things. All the afternoon at the office. William Howe come to see me,
being come up with my Lord from sea: he is grown a discreet, but very
conceited fellow. He tells me how little respectfully Sir W. Pen did
carry it to my Lord onboard the Duke’s ship at sea; and that Captain
Minnes, a favourite of Prince Rupert’s, do shew my Lord little respect;
but that every body else esteems my Lord as they ought. I am sorry for
the folly of the latter, and vexed at the dissimulation of the former.
At night home to supper and to bed. This day was proclaimed at the
‘Change the war with Holland.
