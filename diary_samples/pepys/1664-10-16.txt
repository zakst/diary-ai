16th (Lord’s day). It raining, we set out, and about nine o’clock got
to Hatfield in church-time; and I ‘light and saw my simple Lord Salsbury
sit there in his gallery. Staid not in the Church, but thence mounted
again and to Barnett by the end of sermon, and there dined at the Red
Lyon very weary again, but all my weariness yesterday night and to-day
in my thighs only, the rest of my weariness in my shoulders and arms
being quite gone. Thence home, parting company at my cozen Anth.
Joyce’s, by four o’clock, weary, but very well, to bed at home, where I
find all well. Anon my wife came to bed, but for my ease rose again and
lay with her woman.
