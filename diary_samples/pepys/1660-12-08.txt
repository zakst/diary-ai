8th. To Whitehall to the Privy Seal, and thence to Mr. Pierces the
Surgeon to tell them that I would call by and by to go to dinner. But I
going into Westminster Hall met with Sir G. Carteret and Sir W. Pen (who
were in a great fear that we had committed a great error of L100,000 in
our late account gone into the Parliament in making it too little), and
so I was fain to send order to Mr. Pierces to come to my house; and also
to leave the key of the chest with Mr. Spicer; wherein my Lordâ€™s money
is, and went along with Sir W. Pen by water to the office, and there
with Mr. Huchinson we did find that we were in no mistake. And so I
went to dinner with my wife and Mr. and Mrs. Pierce the Surgeon to Mr.
Pierce, the Purser (the first time that ever I was at his house) who
does live very plentifully and finely. We had a lovely chine of beef and
other good things very complete and drank a great deal of wine, and her
daughter played after dinner upon the virginals,

     [All instruments of the harpsichord and spinet kind were styled
     virginals.]

and at night by lanthorn home again, and Mr. Pierce and his wife being
gone home I went to bed, having drunk so much wine that my head was
troubled and was not very well all night, and the wind I observed was
rose exceedingly before I went to bed.
