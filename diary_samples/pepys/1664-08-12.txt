12th. Up, and all the morning busy at the office with Sir W. Warren
about a great contract for New England masts, where I was very hard with
him, even to the making him angry, but I thought it fit to do it as well
as just for my owne [and] the King’s behalf. At noon to the ‘Change
a little, and so to dinner and then out by coach, setting my wife and
mayde down, going to Stevens the silversmith to change some old silver
lace and to go buy new silke lace for a petticoat; I to White Hall and
did much business at a Tangier Committee; where, among other things,
speaking about propriety of the houses there, and how we ought to let
the Portugeses I have right done them, as many of them as continue, or
did sell the houses while they were in possession, and something further
in their favour, the Duke in an anger I never observed in him before,
did cry, says he, “All the world rides us, and I think we shall never
ride anybody.” Thence home, and, though late, yet Pedro being there, he
sang a song and parted. I did give him 5s., but find it burdensome and
so will break up the meeting. At night is brought home our poor Fancy,
which to my great grief continues lame still, so that I wish she had not
been brought ever home again, for it troubles me to see her.
