21st. To Westminster by coach with Sir W. Pen, and in our way saw the
city begin to build scaffolds against the Coronacion. To my Lord, and
there found him out of doors. So to the Hall and called for some caps
that I have a making there, and here met with Mr. Hawley, and with him
to Willâ€™s and drank, and then by coach with Mr. Langley our old friend
into the city. I set him down by the way, and I home and there staid all
day within, having found Mr. Moore, who staid with me till late at night
talking and reading some good books. Then he went away, and I to bed.
