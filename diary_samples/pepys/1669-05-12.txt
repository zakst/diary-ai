12th. Up, and to Westminster Hall, where the term is, and this the first
day of my being there, and here by chance met Roger Pepys, come to town
the last night: I was glad to see him. After some talk with him and
others, and among others Sir Charles Harbord and Sidney Montagu, the
latter of whom is to set out to-morrow towards Flanders and Italy, I
invited them to dine with me to-morrow, and so to Mrs. Martin’s lodging,
who come to town last night, and there je did hazer her, she having been
a month, I think, at Portsmouth with her husband, newly come home
from the Streights. But, Lord! how silly the woman talks of her great
entertainment there, and how all the gentry come to visit her, and that
she believes her husband is worth L6 or L700, which nevertheless I am
glad of, but I doubt they will spend it a fast. Thence home, and after
dinner my wife and I to the Duke of York’s playhouse, and there, in
the side balcony, over against the musick, did hear, but not see, a
new play, the first day acted, “The Roman Virgin,” an old play, and but
ordinary, I thought; but the trouble of my eyes with the light of the
candles did almost kill me. Thence to my Lord Sandwich’s, and there had
a promise from Sidney to come and dine with me to-morrow; and so my wife
and I home in our coach, and there find my brother John, as I looked
for, come to town from Ellington, where, among other things, he tell
me the first news that my [sister Jackson] is with child, and fat gone,
which I know not whether it did more trouble or please me, having
no great care for my friends to have children; though I love other
people’s. So, glad to see him, we to supper, and so to bed.
