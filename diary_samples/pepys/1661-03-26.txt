26th. Up early to do business in my study. This is my great day that
three years ago I was cut of the stone, and, blessed be God, I do yet
find myself very free from pain again. All this morning I staid at home
looking after my workmen to my great content about my stairs, and
at noon by coach to my father’s, where Mrs. Turner, The. Joyce, Mr.
Morrice, Mr. Armiger, Mr. Pierce, the surgeon, and his wife, my father
and mother, and myself and my wife. Very merry at dinner; among other
things, because Mrs. Turner and her company eat no flesh at all this
Lent, and I had a great deal of good flesh which made their mouths
water. After dinner Mrs. Pierce and her husband and I and my wife to
Salisbury Court, where coming late he and she light of Col. Boone that
made room for them, and I and my wife sat in the pit, and there met with
Mr. Lewes and Tom Whitton, and saw “The Bondman” done to admiration. So
home by coach, and after a view of what the workmen had done to-day I
went to bed.
