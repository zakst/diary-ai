20th. Up and walked to Deptford, where after doing something at the yard
I walked, without being observed, with Bagwell home to his house, and
there was very kindly used, and the poor people did get a dinner for me
in their fashion, of which I also eat very well. After dinner I found
occasion of sending him abroad, and then alone ‘avec elle je tentais
a faire ce que je voudrais et contre sa force je le faisais biens que
passe a mon contentment’. By and by he coming back again I took leave
and walked home, and then there to dinner, where Dr. Fayrebrother come
to see me and Luellin. We dined, and I to the office, leaving them,
where we sat all the afternoon, and I late at the office. To supper and
to the office again very late, then home to bed.
