6th. Waked in the morning before 4 o’clock with great pain to piss, and
great pain in pissing by having, I think, drank too great a draught of
cold drink before going to bed. But by and by to sleep again, and then
rose and to the office, where very busy all the morning, and at noon
to dinner with Sir G. Carteret to his house with all our Board, where a
good pasty and brave discourse. But our great fear was some fresh news
of the fleete, but not from the fleete, all being said to be well and
beaten the Dutch, but I do not give much belief to it, and indeed the
news come from Sir W. Batten at Harwich, and writ so simply that we
all made good mirth of it. Thence to the office, where upon Sir G.
Carteret’s accounts, to my great vexation there being nothing done by
the Controller to right the King therein. I thence to my office and
wrote letters all the afternoon, and in the evening by coach to Sir Ph.
Warwicke’s about my Tangier business to get money, and so to my Lady
Sandwich’s, who, poor lady, expects every hour to hear of my Lord; but
in the best temper, neither confident nor troubled with fear, that
I ever did see in my life. She tells me my Lord Rochester is now
declaredly out of hopes of Mrs. Mallett, and now she is to receive
notice in a day or two how the King stands inclined to the giving leave
for my Lord Hinchingbroke to look after her, and that being done to
bring it to an end shortly. Thence by coach home, and to my office a
little, and so before 12 o’clock home and to bed.
