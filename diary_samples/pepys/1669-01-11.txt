11th. Up, and with W. Hewer, my guard, to White Hall, where no Committee
of Tangier met, so up and down the House talking with this and that man,
and so home, calling at the New Exchange for a book or two to send to
Mr. Shepley and thence home, and thence to the ‘Change, and there did a
little business, and so walked home to dinner, and then abroad with my
wife to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Joviall Crew,” but ill
acted to what it was heretofore, in Clun’s time, and when Lacy could
dance. Thence to the New Exchange, to buy some things; and, among
others, my wife did give me my pair of gloves, which, by contract, she
is to give me in her L30 a-year. Here Mrs. Smith tells us of the great
murder thereabouts, on Saturday last, of one Captain Bumbridge, by one
Symons, both of her acquaintance; and hectors that were at play, and in
drink: the former is killed, and is kinsman to my Lord of Ormond, which
made him speak of it with so much passion, as I overheard him this
morning, but could not make anything of it till now, but would they
would kill more of them. So home; and there at home all the evening;
and made Tom to prick down some little conceits and notions of mine,
in musique, which do mightily encourage me to spend some more thoughts
about it; for I fancy, upon good reason, that I am in the right way of
unfolding the mystery of this matter, better than ever yet.
