19th. Up and to St. James’s, where long with Mr. Coventry, Povy, &c., in
their Tangier accounts, but such the folly of that coxcomb Povy that we
could do little in it, and so parted for the time, and I to walk with
Creed and Vernaty in the Physique Garden in St. James’s Parke; where I
first saw orange-trees, and other fine trees. So to Westminster Hall,
and thence by water to the Temple, and so walked to the ‘Change, and
there find the ‘Change full of news from Guinny, some say the Dutch have
sunk our ships and taken our fort, and others say we have done the same
to them. But I find by our merchants that something is done, but is yet
a secret among them. So home to dinner, and then to the office, and
at night with Captain Tayler consulting how to get a little money by
letting him the Elias to fetch masts from New England. So home to supper
and to bed.
