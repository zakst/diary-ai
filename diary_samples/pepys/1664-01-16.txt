16th. Up, and having paid some money in the morning to my uncle Thomas
on his yearly annuity, to the office, where we sat all the morning.
At noon I to the ‘Change about some pieces of eight for Sir J. Lawson.
There I hear that Collonell Turner is found guilty of felony at the
Sessions in Mr. Tryan’s business, which will save his life. So home and
met there J. Hasper come to see his kinswoman our Jane. I made much of
him and made him dine with us, he talking after the old simple manner
that he used to do. He being gone, I by water to Westminster Hall, and
there did see Mrs. Lane..... So by coach home and to my office, where
Browne of the Minerys brought me an Instrument made of a Spyral line
very pretty for all questions in Arithmetique almost, but it must be
some use that must make me perfect in it. So home to supper and to bed,
with my mind ‘un peu troubled pour ce que fait’ to-day, but I hope it
will be ‘la dernier de toute ma vie.’
