10th. Up early. Sir Wm. Batten and I to make up an account of the wages
of the officers and mariners at sea, ready to present to the Committee
of Parliament this afternoon. Afterwards came the Treasurer and
Comptroller, and sat all the morning with us till the business was done.
So we broke up, leaving the thing to be wrote over fair and carried to
Trinity House for Sir Wm. Batten’s hand. When staying very long I found
(as appointed) the Treasurer and Comptroller at Whitehall, and so we
went with a foul copy to the Parliament house, where we met with
Sir Thos. Clarges and Mr. Spry, and after we had given them good
satisfaction we parted. The Comptroller and I to the coffee-house,
where he shewed me the state of his case; how the King did owe him about
L6000. But I do not see great likelihood for them to be paid, since they
begin already in Parliament to dispute the paying of the just sea-debts,
which were already promised to be paid, and will be the undoing of
thousands if they be not paid. So to Whitehall to look but could not
find Mr. Fox, and then to Mr. Moore at Mr. Crew’s, but missed of him
also. So to Paul’s Churchyard, and there bought Montelion, which this
year do not prove so good as the last was; so after reading it I burnt
it. After reading of that and the comedy of the Rump, which is also very
silly, I went to bed. This night going home, Will and I bought a goose.
