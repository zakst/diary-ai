29th. Up about 6 o’clock, and found the people to have just done,
and Hannah not gone to bed yet, but was making clean of the yard and
kitchen. Will newly gone to bed. So I to my office, and having given
some order to Tom Hater, to whom I gave leave for his recreation to go
down to Portsmouth this Pay, I went down to Wapping to Sir W. Warren,
and there staid an hour or two discoursing of some of his goods and then
things in general relating to this office, &c., and so home, and there
going to Sir William Batten (having no stomach to dine at home, it being
yet hardly clean of last night’s [mess])and there I dined with my Lady
and her daughter and son Castle, and mighty kind she is and I kind to
her, but, Lord! how freely and plainly she rails against Commissioner
Pett, calling him rogue, and wondering that the King keeps such a fellow
in the Navy. Thence by and by walked to see Sir W. Pen at Deptford,
reading by the way a most ridiculous play, a new one, called “The
Politician Cheated.” After a little sitting with him I walked to the
yard a little and so home again, my Will with me, whom I bade to stay in
the yard for me, and so to bed. This morning my brother Tom was with me,
and we had some discourse again concerning his country mistress, but I
believe the most that is fit for us to condescend to, will not content
her friends.
