17th. In the morning to Whitehall, where I inquired at the Privy
Seal Office for a form for a nobleman to make one his Chaplain. But I
understanding that there is not any, I did draw up one, and so to my
Lord’s, and there I did give him it to sign for Mr. Turner to be his
first Chaplain. I did likewise get my Lord to sign my last sea accounts,
so that I am even to this day when I have received the balance of Mr.
Creed. I dined with my Lady and my Lady Pickering, where her son John
dined with us, who do continue a fool as he ever was since I knew him.
His mother would fain marry him to get a portion for his sister Betty
but he will not hear of it. Hither came Major Hart this noon, who tells
me that the Regiment is now disbanded, and that there is some money
coming to me for it. I took him to my Lord to Mr. Crew’s, and from
thence with Mr. Shepley and Mr. Moore to the Devil Tavern, and there we
drank. So home and wrote letters by the post. Then to my lyra viall,

     [The lyre viol is a viol with extra open bass strings, holding the
     same relation to the viol as the theorbo does to the lute.  A volume
     entitled “Musick’s Recreation on the Lyra Viol,” was printed by John
     Playford in 1650.]

and to bed.
