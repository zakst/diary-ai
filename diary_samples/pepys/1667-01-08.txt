8th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning. At noon home
to dinner, where my uncle Thomas with me to receive his quarterage. He
tells me his son Thomas is set up in Smithfield, where he hath a shop--I
suppose, a booth. Presently after dinner to the office, and there set
close to my business and did a great deal before night, and am resolved
to stand to it, having been a truant too long. At night to Sir W.
Batten’s to consider some things about our prizes, and then to other
talk, and among other things he tells me that he hears for certain that
Sir W. Coventry hath resigned to the King his place of Commissioner of
the Navy, the thing he bath often told me that he had a mind to do, but
I am surprised to think that he hath done it, and am full of thoughts
all this evening after I heard it what may be the consequences of it to
me. So home and to supper, and then saw the catalogue of my books, which
my brother had wrote out, now perfectly alphabeticall, and so to bed.
Sir Richard Ford did this evening at Sir W. Batten’s tell us that upon
opening the body of my Lady Denham it is said that they found a vessel
about her matrix which had never been broke by her husband, that caused
all pains in her body. Which if true is excellent invention to clear
both the Duchesse from poison or the Duke from lying with her.
