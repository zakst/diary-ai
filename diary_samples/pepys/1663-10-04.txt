4th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and to church, my house being miserably overflooded
with rayne last night, which makes me almost mad. At home to dinner with
my wife, and so to talk, and to church again, and so home, and all the
evening most pleasantly passed the time in good discourse of our fortune
and family till supper, and so to bed, in some pain below, through cold
got.
