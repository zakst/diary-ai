3rd. Up and to the office all the morning, and dined alone with my wife
at noon, and then to my office all the afternoon till night, putting
business in order with great content in my mind. Having nothing now
in my mind of trouble in the world, but quite the contrary, much joy,
except only the ending of our difference with my uncle Thomas, and the
getting of the bills well over for my building of my house here, which
however are as small and less than any of the others. Sir W. Pen it
seems is fallen very ill again. So to my arithmetique again to-night,
and so home to supper and to bed.
