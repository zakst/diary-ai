7th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, at noon home to
dinner, where Mercer with us, and after dinner she, my wife, Deb., and
I, to the King’s playhouse, and there saw “The Spanish Gipsys,” the
second time of acting, and the first that I saw it. A very silly
play, only great variety of dances, and those most excellently done,
especially one part by one Hanes, only lately come thither from the
Nursery, an understanding fellow, but yet, they say, hath spent L1000
a-year before he come thither. This day my wife and I full of thoughts
about Mrs. Pierces sending me word that she, and my old company, Harris
and Knipp, would come and dine with us next Wednesday, how we should
do-to receive or put them off, my head being, at this time, so full of
business, and my wife in no mind to have them neither, and yet I desire
it. Come to no resolution tonight. Home from the playhouse to the
office, where I wrote what I had to write, and among others to my father
to congratulate my sister’s marriage, and so home to supper a little and
then to bed.
