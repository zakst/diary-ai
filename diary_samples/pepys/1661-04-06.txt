6th. Up among my workmen, then to Whitehall, and there at Privy Seal and
elsewhere did business, and among other things met with Mr. Townsend,
who told of his mistake the other day, to put both his legs through one
of his knees of his breeches, and went so all day. Then with Mr. Creed
and Moore to the Leg in the Palace to dinner which I gave them, and
after dinner I saw the girl of the house, being very pretty, go into a
chamber, and I went in after her and kissed her. Then by water, Creed
and I, to Salisbury Court and there saw “Love’s Quarrell” acted the
first time, but I do not like the design or words. So calling at my
father’s, where they and my wife well, and so home and to bed.
