26th (Lordâ€™s day). To church in the morning, and then home to dinner
alone with my wife, and so both to church in the afternoon and home
again, and so to read and talk with my wife, and to supper and to
bed. It having been a very fine clear frosty day-God send us more of
them!--for the warm weather all this winter makes us fear a sick summer.
But thanks be to God, since my leaving drinking of wine, I do find
myself much better and do mind my business better, and do spend less
money, and less time lost in idle company.
