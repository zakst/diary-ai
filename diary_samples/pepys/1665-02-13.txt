13th. Up and to St. James’s, did our usual business before the Duke.
Thence I to Westminster and by water (taking Mr. Stapely the rope-maker
by the way), to his rope-ground and to Limehouse, there to see the
manner of stoves and did excellently inform myself therein, and coming
home did go on board Sir W. Petty’s “Experiment,” which is a brave roomy
vessel, and I hope may do well. So went on shore to a Dutch [house] to
drink some mum, and there light upon some Dutchmen, with whom we had
good discourse touching stoveing

     [Stoveing, in sail-making, is the heating of the bolt-ropes, so as
     to make them pliable.--B.]

and making of cables. But to see how despicably they speak of us for
our using so many hands more to do anything than they do, they closing
a cable with 20, that we use 60 men upon. Thence home and eat something,
and then to my office, where very late, and then to supper and to bed.
Captain Stokes, it seems, is at last dead at Portsmouth.
