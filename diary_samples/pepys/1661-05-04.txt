4th. Up in the morning and took coach, and so to Gilford, where we lay
at the Red Lyon, the best Inn, and lay in the room the King lately lay
in, where we had time to see the Hospital, built by Archbishop Abbott,
and the free school, and were civilly treated by the Mayster. So to
supper, and to bed, being very merry about our discourse with the
Drawers concerning the minister of the Town, with a red face and a
girdle. So to bed, where we lay and sleep well.
