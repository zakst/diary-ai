22nd (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and my wife, poor wretch, still in pain, and
then to dress myself and down to my chamber to settle some papers, and
thither come to me Willet with an errand from her mistress, and this
time I first did give her a little kiss, she being a very pretty
humoured girle, and so one that I do love mightily. Thence to my office,
and there did a little business, and so to church, where a dull sermon,
and then home, and Cozen Kate Joyce come and dined with me and Mr.
Holliard; but by chance I offering occasion to him to discourse of
the Church of Rome, Lord! how he run on to discourse with the greatest
vehemence and importunity in the world, as the only thing in the world
that he is full of, and it was good sport to me to see him so earnest on
so little occasion. She come to see us and to tell me that her husband
is going to build his house again, and would borrow of me L300, which
I shall upon good security be willing to do, and so told her, being
willing to have some money out of my hands upon good security. After
dinner up to my wife again, who is in great pain still with her tooth,
and there, they gone, I spent the most of the afternoon and night
reading and talking to bear her company, and so to supper and to bed.
