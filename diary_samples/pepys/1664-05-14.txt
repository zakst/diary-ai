14th. Up, full of pain, I believe by cold got yesterday. So to the
office, where we sat, and after office home to dinner, being in
extraordinary pain. After dinner my pain increasing I was forced to go
to bed, and by and by my pain rose to be as great for an hour or two as
ever I remember it was in any fit of the stone, both in the lower
part of my belly and in my back also. No wind could I break. I took
a glyster, but it brought away but a little, and my height of pain
followed it. At last after two hours lying thus in most extraordinary
anguish, crying and roaring, I know not what, whether it was my great
sweating that may do it, but upon getting by chance, among my other
tumblings, upon my knees, in bed, my pain began to grow less and less,
till in an hour after I was in very little pain, but could break no
wind, nor make any water, and so continued, and slept well all night.
