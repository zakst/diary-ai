2nd. Infinite of business that my heart and head and all were full. Met
with purser Washington, with whom and a lady, a friend of his, I dined
at the Bell Tavern in King Street, but the rogue had no more manners
than to invite me and to let me pay my club. All the afternoon with my
Lord, going up and down the town; at seven at night he went home, and
there the principal Officers of the Navy,

     [A list of the Officers of the Admiralty, May 31st, 1660.  From a
     MS. in the Pepysian Library in Pepysâ€™s own handwriting.
     His Royal Highness James, Duke of York, Lord High Admiral.
     Sir George Carteret, Treasurer.
     Sir Robert Slingsby, (soon after) Comptroller.
     Sir William Batten, Surveyor.
     Samuel Pepys, Esq., Clerk of the Acts.

     Sir William Penn,                 | Commissioners.
     Peter Pett, Esq.--B,]             |

among the rest myself was reckoned one. We had order to meet to-morrow,
to draw up such an order of the Council as would put us into action
before our patents were passed. At which my heart was glad. At night
supped with my Lord, he and I together, in the great dining-room alone
by ourselves, the first time I ever did it in London. Home to bed, my
maid pretty well again.
