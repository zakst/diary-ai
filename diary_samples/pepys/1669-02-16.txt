16th. Up, and to the office, where all the morning, my head full of
business of the office now at once on my hands, and so at noon home to
dinner, where I find some things of W. Batelier’s come out of France,
among which some clothes for my wife, wherein she is likely to lead me
to the expence of so much money as vexed me; but I seemed so, more than
I at this time was, only to prevent her taking too much, and she was
mighty calm under it. But I was mightily pleased with another picture of
the King of France’s head, of Nanteuil’s, bigger than the other which
he brought over, that pleases me infinitely: and so to the Office, where
busy all the afternoon, though my eyes mighty bad with the light of the
candles last night, which was so great as to make my eyes sore all this
day, and do teach me, by a manifest experiment, that it is only too much
light that do make my eyes sore. Nevertheless, with the help of my tube,
and being desirous of easing my mind of five or six days journall, I did
venture to write it down from ever since this day se’nnight, and I think
without hurting my eyes any more than they were before, which was very
much, and so home to supper and to bed.
