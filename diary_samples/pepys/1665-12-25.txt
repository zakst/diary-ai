25th (Christmas-day). To church in the morning, and there saw a wedding
in the church, which I have not seen many a day; and the young people
so merry one with another, and strange to see what delight we married
people have to see these poor fools decoyed into our condition, every
man and woman gazing and smiling at them. Here I saw again my beauty
Lethulier. Thence to my Lord Brunckerâ€™s by invitation and dined there,
and so home to look over and settle my papers, both of my accounts
private, and those of Tangier, which I have let go so long that it were
impossible for any soul, had I died, to understand them, or ever come
to any good end in them. I hope God will never suffer me to come to that
disorder again.
