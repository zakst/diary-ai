17th. Up, and to several places doing business, and the home to
dinner, and then my wife and I and brother John by coach to the King’s
playhouse, and saw “The Spanish Curate” revived, which is a pretty good
play, but my eyes troubled with seeing it, mightily. Thence carried them
and Mr. Gibson, who met me at my Lord Brouncker’s with a fair copy of my
petition, which I thought to shew the Duke of York this night, but could
not, and therefore carried them to the Park, where they had never been,
and so home to supper and to bed. Great the news now of the French
taking St. Domingo, in Spaniola, from the Spaniards, which troubles
us, that they should have it, and have the honour of taking it, when we
could not.
