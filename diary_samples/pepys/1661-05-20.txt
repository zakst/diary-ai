20th. At home all the morning; paid L50 to one Mr. Grant for Mr. Barlow,
for the last half year, and was visited by Mr. Anderson, my former
chamber fellow at Cambridge, with whom I parted at the Hague, but I did
not go forthwith him, only gave him a morning draft at home. At noon Mr.
Creed came to me, and he and I to the Exchange, and so to an ordinary to
dinner, and after dinner to the Mitre, and there sat drinking while it
rained very much. Then to the office, where I found Sir Williams both,
choosing of masters for the new fleet of ships that is ordered to be set
forth, and Pen seeming to be in an ugly humour, not willing to gratify
one that I mentioned to be put in, did vex me. We sat late, and so home.
Mr. Moore came to me when I was going to bed, and sat with me a good
while talking about my Lordâ€™s business and our own and so good night.
