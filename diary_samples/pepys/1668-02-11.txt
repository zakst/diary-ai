11th. At the office all the morning, where comes a damned summons to
attend the Committee of Miscarriages to-day, which makes me mad, that
I should by my place become the hackney of this Office, in perpetual
trouble and vexation, that need it least. At noon home to dinner, where
little pleasure, my head being split almost with the variety of
troubles upon me at this time, and cares, and after dinner by coach to
Westminster Hall, and sent my wife and Deb. to see “Mustapha”
 acted. Here I brought a book to the Committee, and do find them; and
particularly Sir Thomas Clarges, mighty hot in the business of tickets,
which makes me mad to see them bite at the stone, and not at the hand
that flings it, and here my Lord Brouncker unnecessarily orders it that
he is called in to give opportunity to present his report of the state
of the business of paying by ticket, which I do not think will do him
any right, though he was made believe that it did operate mightily, and
that Sir Fresh. Hollis did make a mighty harangue and to much purpose in
his defence, but I believe no such effects of it, for going in afterward
I did hear them speak with prejudice of it, and that his pleading of the
Admiral’s warrant for it now was only an evasion, if not an aspersion
upon the Admirall, and therefore they would not admit of this his
report, but go on with their report as they had resolved before. The
orders they sent for this day was the first order that I have yet met
with about this business, and was of my own single hand warranting,
but I do think it will do me no harm, and therefore do not much trouble
myself with it, more than to see how much trouble I am brought to who
have best deported myself in all the King’s business. Thence with Lord
Brouncker, and set him down at Bow Streete, and so to the Duke of York’s
playhouse, and there saw the last act for nothing, where I never saw
such good acting of any creature as Smith’s part of Zanger; and I do
also, though it was excellently acted by---------, do yet want Betterton
mightily. Thence to the Temple, to Porter’s chamber, where Cocke met me,
and after a stay there some time, they two and I to Pemberton’s chamber,
and there did read over the Act of calling people to account, and did
discourse all our business of the prizes; and, upon the whole, he
do make it plainly appear, that there is no avoiding to give these
Commissioners satisfaction in everything they will ask; and that
there is fear lest they may find reason to make us refund for all the
extraordinary profit made by those bargains; and do make me resolve
rather to declare plainly, and, once for all, the truth of the whole,
and what my profit hath been, than be forced at last to do it, and in
the meantime live in gain, as I must always do: and with this resolution
on my part I departed, with some more satisfaction of mind, though with
less hopes of profit than I expected. It was pretty here to see the
heaps of money upon this lawyer’s table; and more to see how he had
not since last night spent any time upon our business, but begun with
telling us that we were not at all concerned in that Act; which was a
total mistake, by his not having read over the Act at all. Thence to
Porter’s chamber, where Captain Cocke had fetched my wife out of
the coach, and there we staid and talked and drank, he being a very
generous, good-humoured man, and so away by coach, setting Cocke at his
house, and we with his coach home, and there I to the office, and there
till past one in the morning, and so home to supper and to bed, my mind
at pretty good ease, though full of care and fear of loss. This morning
my wife in bed told me the story of our Tom and Jane:--how the rogue did
first demand her consent to love and marry him, and then, with pretence
of displeasing me, did slight her; but both he and she have confessed
the matter to her, and she hath charged him to go on with his love to
her, and be true to her, and so I think the business will go on, which,
for my love to her, because she is in love with him, I am pleased with;
but otherwise I think she will have no good bargain of it, at least if
I should not do well in my place. But if I do stand, I do intend to give
her L50 in money, and do them all the good I can in my way.
