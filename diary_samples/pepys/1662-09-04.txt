4th. Which I did, and by water betimes to the Tower and so home, where
I shifted myself, being to dine abroad, and so being also trimmed, which
is a thing I have very seldom done of late, I gat to my office and then
met and sit all the morning, and at noon we all to the Trinity House,
where we treated, very dearly, I believe, the officers of the Ordnance;
where was Sir W. Compton and the rest and the Lieutenant of the Tower.
We had much and good music, which was my best entertainment. Sir Wm.
Compton I heard talk with great pleasure of the difference between the
fleet now and in Queen Elisabeth’s days; where, in 88, she had but 36
sail great and small, in the world; and ten rounds of powder was their
allowance at that time against the Spaniard. After Sir W. Compton and
Mr. Coventry, and some of the best of the rest were gone, I grew weary
of staying with Sir Williams both, and the more for that my Lady Batten
and her crew, at least half a score, come into the room, and I believe
we shall pay size for it; but ‘tis very pleasant to see her in her
hair under her hood, and how by little and little she would fain be a
gallant; but, Lord! the company she keeps about her are like herself,
that she may be known by them what she is. Being quite weary I stole
from them and to my office, where I did business till 9 at night, and so
to my lodgings to bed.
