11th. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning, and at noon home
and heard that the last night Colonel Middletonâ€™s wife died, a woman I
never saw since she come hither, having never been within their house
since. Home at noon to dinner, and thence to work all the afternoon with
great pleasure, and did bring my business to a very little compass in my
day book, which is a mighty pleasure, and so home to supper and get my
wife to read to me, and then to bed.
