26th (Lordâ€™s day). Up, and all the morning and after dinner, the
afternoon also, with W. Hewer in my closet, setting right my Tangier
Accounts, which I have let alone these six months and more, but find
them very right, and is my great comfort. So in the evening to walk with
my wife, and to supper and to bed.
