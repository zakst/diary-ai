7th. Up, and to the office, where Kate Joyce come to me about some
tickets of hers, but took no notice to me of her being married, but
seemed mighty pale, and doubtful what to say or do, expecting, I
believe, that I should begin; and not finding me beginning, said
nothing, but, with trouble in her face, went away. At the office all
the morning, and after dinner also all the afternoon, and in the evening
with my wife and Deb. and Betty Turner to Unthankeâ€™s, where we are fain
to go round by Newgate, because of Fleet Bridge being under rebuilding.
They stayed there, and I about some business, and then presently back
and brought them home and supped and Mrs. Turner, the mother, comes to
us, and there late, and so to bed.
