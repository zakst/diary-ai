6th. Up and with Sir J. Minnes and Sir W. Pen to St. James’s, but the
Duke is gone abroad. So to White Hall to him, and there I spoke with
him, and so to Westminster, did a little business, and then home to
the ‘Change, where also I did some business, and went off and ended my
contract with the “Kingfisher” I hired for Tangier, and I hope to get
something by it. Thence home to dinner, and visited Sir W. Batten, who
is sick again, worse than he was, and I am apt to think is very ill. So
to my office, and among other things with Sir W. Warren 4 hours or more
till very late, talking of one thing or another, and have concluded a
firm league with him in all just ways to serve him and myself all I can,
and I think he will be a most usefull and thankfull man to me. So home
to supper and to bed. This being one of the coldest days, all say,
they ever felt in England; and I this day, under great apprehensions
of getting an ague from my putting a suit on that hath lain by without
ayring a great while, and I pray God it do not do me hurte.
