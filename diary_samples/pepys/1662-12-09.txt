9th. Lay long with my wife, contenting her about the business of
Gosnell’s going, and I perceive she will be contented as well as myself,
and so to the office, and after sitting all the morning in hopes to have
Mr. Coventry dine with me, he was forced to go to White Hall, and so I
dined with my own company only, taking Mr. Hater home with me, but
he, poor man, was not very well, and so could not eat any thing. After
dinner staid within all the afternoon, being vexed in my mind about the
going away of Sarah this afternoon, who cried mightily, and so was I
ready to do, and Jane did also, and then anon went Gosnell away, which
did trouble me too; though upon many considerations, it is better that
I am rid of the charge. All together makes my house appear to me very
lonely, which troubles me much, and in a melancholy humour I went to
the office, and there about business sat till I was called to Sir
G. Carteret at the Treasury office about my Lord Treasurer’s letter,
wherein he puts me to a new trouble to write it over again. So home
and late with Sir John Minnes at the office looking over Mr. Creed’s
accounts, and then home and to supper, and my wife and I melancholy to
bed.
