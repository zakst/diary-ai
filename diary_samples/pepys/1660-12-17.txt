17th. All day looking after my workmen, only in the afternoon to the
office where both Sir Williams were come from Woolwich, and tell us
that, contrary to their expectations, the Assurance is got up, without
much damage to her body, only to the goods that she hath within her,
which argues her to be a strong, good ship. This day my parlour is
gilded, which do please me well.
