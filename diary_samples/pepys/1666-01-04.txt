4th. Up, and to the office, where my Lord Bruncker and I, against Sir W.
Batten and Sir J. Minnes and the whole table, for Sir W. Warren in the
business of his mast contract, and overcome them and got them to do what
I had a mind to, for indeed my Lord being unconcerned in what I aimed
at. So home to dinner, where Mr. Sheldon come by invitation from
Woolwich, and as merry as I could be with all my thoughts about me and
my wife still in pain of her tooth. He anon took leave and took Mrs.
Barbary his niece home with him, and seems very thankful to me for the
L10 I did give him for my wife’s rent of his house, and I am sure I am
beholding to him, for it was a great convenience to me, and then my wife
home to London by water and I to the office till 8 at night, and so
to my Lord Bruncker’s, thinking to have been merry, having appointed
a meeting for Sir J. Minnes and his company and Mrs. Knipp again,
but whatever hindered I know not, but no company come, which vexed me
because it disappointed me of the glut of mirthe I hoped for. However,
good discourse with my Lord and merry, with Mrs. Williams’s descants
upon Sir J. Minnes’s and Mrs. Turner’s not coming. So home and to bed.
