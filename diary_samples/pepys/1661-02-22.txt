22nd. Within all the morning, and at noon with my wife, by appointment
to dinner at the Dolphin, where Sir W. Batten, and his lady and daughter
Matt, and Captain Cocke and his lady, a German lady, but a very great
beauty, and we dined together, at the spending of some wagers won and
lost between him and I; and there we had the best musique and very good
songs, and were very merry and danced, but I was most of all taken with
Madam Cocke and her little boy, which in mirth his father had given to
me. But after all our mirth comes a reckoning of L4, besides 40s. to
the musicians, which did trouble us, but it must be paid, and so I took
leave and left them there about eight at night. And on foot went to
the Temple, and then took my cozen Turnerâ€™s man Roger, and went by his
advice to Serjeant Fountaine and told him our case, who gives me good
comfort in it, and I gave him 30s. fee. So home again and to bed. This
day a good pretty maid was sent my wife by Mary Bowyer, whom my wife has
hired.
