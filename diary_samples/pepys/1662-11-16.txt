16th (Lord’s day). About 3 o’clock in the morning waked with a rude
noise among Sir J. Minnes his servants (he not being yet come to his
lodgings), who are the rudest people but they that lived before, one
Mrs. Davis, that ever I knew in my life. To sleep again, and after long
talking pleasantly with my wife, up and to church, where Mrs. Goodyer,
now Mrs. Buckworth, was churched. I love the woman for her gravity
above any in the parish. So home and to dinner with my wife with great
content, and after dinner walked up and down my house, which is now
almost finished, there being nothing to do but the glazier and furniture
to put up. By and by comes Tom, and after a little talk I with him
towards his end, but seeing many strangers and coaches coming to our
church, and finding that it was a sermon to be preached by a probationer
for the Turkey Company,--[The Turkey or Levant Company was established
in 1581.]--to be sent to Smyrna, I returned thither. And several Turkey
merchants filled all the best pews (and some in ours) in the Church, but
a most pitiful sermon it was upon a text in Zachariah, and a great time
he spent to show whose son Zachary was, and to prove Malachi to be the
last prophet before John the Baptist. Home and to see Sir W. Pen, who
gets strength, but still keeps his bed. Then home and to my office to do
some business there, and so home to supper and to bed.
