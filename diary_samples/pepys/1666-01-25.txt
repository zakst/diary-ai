25th. Up and to the office, at noon home to dinner. So abroad to the
Duke of Albemarle and Kate Joyce’s and her husband, with whom I talked
a great deale about Pall’s business, and told them what portion I would
give her, and they do mightily like of it and will proceed further in
speaking with Harman, who hath already been spoke to about it, as from
them only, and he is mighty glad of it, but doubts it may be an offence
to me, if I should know of it, so thinks that it do come only from
Joyce, which I like the better. So I do believe the business will go
on, and I desire it were over. I to the office then, where I did much
business, and set my people to work against furnishing me to go to
Hampton Court, where the King and Duke will be on Sunday next. It is now
certain that the King of France hath publickly declared war against
us, and God knows how little fit we are for it. At night comes Sir
W. Warren, and he and I into the garden, and talked over all our
businesses. He gives me good advice not to embarke into trade (as I have
had it in my thoughts about Colonell Norwood) so as to be seen to mind
it, for it will do me hurte, and draw my mind off from my business and
embroile my estate too soon. So to the office business, and I find him
as cunning a man in all points as ever I met with in my life and mighty
merry we were in the discourse of our owne trickes. So about to o’clock
at night I home and staid with him there settling my Tangier-Boates
business and talking and laughing at the folly of some of our neighbours
of this office till two in the morning and so to bed.
