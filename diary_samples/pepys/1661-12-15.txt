15th (Lordâ€™s day). To church in the morning, where our young Reader
begun the first day to read. Sir W. Pen dined with me and we were merry.
Again to church and so home, and all alone read till bedtime, and so
to prayers and to bed. I have been troubled this day about a difference
between my wife and her maid Nell, who is a simple slut, and I am afeard
we shall find her a cross-grained wench. I am now full of study about
writing something about our making of strangers strike to us at sea; and
so am altogether reading Selden and Grotius, and such other authors to
that purpose.
