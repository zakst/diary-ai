10s. which is now 24s. We adjourned to a fortnight hence. So broke up,
and I to see Sir W. Pen, who is now pretty well, but lies in bed still;
he cannot rise to stand. Then to my office late, and this afternoon my
wife in her discontent sent me a letter, which I am in a quandary what
to do, whether to read it or not, but I purpose not, but to burn it
before her face, that I may put a stop to more of this nature. But
I must think of some way, either to find her some body to keep her
company, or to set her to work, and by employment to take up her
thoughts and time. After doing what I had to do I went home to supper,
and there was very sullen to my wife, and so went to bed and to sleep
(though with much ado, my mind being troubled) without speaking one word
to her.
