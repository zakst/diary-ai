18th. At the office all the morning, dined at home with a very good
dinner, only my wife and I, which is not yet very usual. In the
afternoon my wife and I and Mrs. Martha Batten, my Valentine, to the
Exchange, and there upon a payre of embroydered and six payre of plain
white gloves I laid out 40s. upon her. Then we went to a mercer’s at the
end of Lombard Street, and there she bought a suit of Lutestring--[More
properly called “lustring”; a fine glossy silk.]--for herself, and so
home. And at night I got the whole company and Sir Wm. Pen home to my
house, and there I did give them Rhenish wine and sugar, and continued
together till it was late, and so to bed. It is much talked that the
King is already married to the niece of the Prince de Ligne,

     [The Prince de Ligne had no niece, and probably Pepys has made some
     mistake in the name.  Charles at one time made an offer of marriage
     to Mazarin’s niece, Hortense Mancini.]

and that he hath two sons already by her: which I am sorry to hear; but
yet am gladder that it should be so, than that the Duke of York and
his family should come to the crown, he being a professed friend to the
Catholiques.
