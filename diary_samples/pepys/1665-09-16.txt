16th. Up, and walked to Greenwich reading a play, and to the office,
where I find Sir J. Minnes gone to the fleete, like a doating foole,
to do no good, but proclaim himself an asse; for no service he can do
there, nor inform my Lord, who is come in thither to the buoy of the
Nore, in anything worth his knowledge. At noon to dinner to my Lord
Bruncker, where Sir W. Batten and his Lady come, by invitation, and very
merry we were, only that the discourse of the likelihood of the increase
of the plague this weeke makes us a little sad, but then again the
thoughts of the late prizes make us glad. After dinner, by appointment,
comes Mr. Andrews, and he and I walking alone in the garden talking
of our Tangier business, and I endeavoured by the by to offer some
encouragements for their continuing in the business, which he seemed
to take hold of, and the truth is my profit is so much concerned that I
could wish they would, and would take pains to ease them in the business
of money as much as was possible. He being gone (after I had ordered him
L2000, and he paid me my quantum out of it) I also walked to the office,
and there to my business; but find myself, through the unfitness of my
place to write in, and my coming from great dinners, and drinking wine,
that I am not in the good temper of doing business now a days that I
used to be and ought still to be. At night to Captain Cocke’s, meaning
to lie there, it being late, and he not being at home, I walked to him
to my Lord Bruncker’s, and there staid a while, they being at tables;
and so by and by parted, and walked to his house; and, after a mess of
good broth, to bed, in great pleasure, his company being most excellent.
