13th. All the morning at home, and Mr. Berkenshaw (whom I have not seen
a great while, came to see me), who staid with me a great while talking
of musique, and I am resolved to begin to learn of him to compose, and
to begin to-morrow, he giving of me so great hopes that I shall soon do
it. Before twelve o’clock comes, by appointment, Mr. Peter and the Dean,
and Collonel Noniwood, brothers, to dine with me; but so soon that I was
troubled at it. But, however, I entertained them with talk and oysters
till one o’clock, and then we sat down to dinner, not staying for my
uncle and aunt Wight, at which I was troubled, but they came by and by,
and so we dined very merry, at least I seemed so, but the dinner does
not please me, and less the Dean and Collonel, whom I found to be
pitiful sorry gentlemen, though good-natured, but Mr. Peter above them
both, who after dinner did show us the experiment (which I had heard
talk of) of the chymicall glasses, which break all to dust by breaking
off a little small end; which is a great mystery to me. They being gone,
my aunt Wight and my wife and I to cards, she teaching of us how to play
at gleeke, which is a pretty game; but I have not my head so free as
to be troubled with it. By and by comes my uncle Wight back, and so to
supper and talk, and then again to cards, when my wife and I beat them
two games and they us one, and so good night and to bed.
