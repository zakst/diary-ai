13th. At the office all the morning, at noon home to dinner, and out to
Bishopsgate Street, and there bought some drinking-glasses, a case of
knives, and other things, against tomorrow, in expectation of my Lord
Hinchingbrokeâ€™s coming to dine with me. So home, and having set some
things in the way of doing, also against to-morrow, I to my office,
there to dispatch business, and do here receive notice from my Lord
Hinchingbroke that he is not well, and so not in condition to come to
dine with me to-morrow, which I am not in much trouble for, because
of the disorder my house is in, by the bricklayers coming to mend the
chimney in my dining-room for smoking, which they were upon almost till
midnight, and have now made it very pretty, and do carry smoke exceeding
well. This evening come all the Houblons to me, to invite me to sup with
them to-morrow night. I did take them home, and there we sat and talked
a good while, and a glass of wine, and then parted till to-morrow night.
So at night, well satisfied in the alteration of my chimney, to bed.
