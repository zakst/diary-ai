December 1st. Up, and to the office, where sat all the morning, and
at noon with my people to dinner, and so to the office, very busy
till night, and then home and made my boy read to me Wilkinsâ€™s Reall
Character, which do please me mightily, and so after supper to bed with
great pleasure and content with my wife. This day I hear of poor Mr.
Clerke, the solicitor, being dead, of a cold, after being not above two
days ill, which troubles me mightily, poor man!
