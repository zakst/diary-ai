18th. The Captains went with me to the post-house about 9 o’clock, and
after a morning draft I took horse and guide for London; and through
some rain, and a great wind in my face, I got to London at eleven
o’clock. At home found all well, but the monkey loose, which did anger
me, and so I did strike her till she was almost dead, that they might
make her fast again, which did still trouble me more. In the afternoon
we met at the office and sat till night, and then I to see my father who
I found well, and took him to Standing’s’ to drink a cup of ale. He told
me my aunt at Brampton is yet alive and my mother well there. In comes
Will Joyce to us drunk, and in a talking vapouring humour of his state,
and I know not what, which did vex me cruelly. After him Mr. Hollier had
learned at my father’s that I was here (where I had appointed to meet
him) and so he did give me some things to take for prevention. Will
Joyce not letting us talk as I would I left my father and him and took
Mr. Hollier to the Greyhound, where he did advise me above all things,
both as to the stone and the decay of my memory (of which I now complain
to him), to avoid drinking often, which I am resolved, if I can, to
leave off. Hence home, and took home with me from the bookseller’s
Ogilby’s AEsop, which he had bound for me, and indeed I am very much
pleased with the book. Home and to bed.
