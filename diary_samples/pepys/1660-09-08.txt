8th. This morning Sir Wm. and the Treasurer and I went by barge with Sir
Wm. Doyley and Mr. Prin to Deptford, to pay off the Henrietta, and had
a good dinner. I went to Mr. Davysâ€™s and saw his house (where I was
once before a great while ago) and I found him a very pretty man. In the
afternoon Commissioner Pett and I went on board the yacht, which indeed
is one of the finest things that ever I saw for neatness and room in so
small a vessel. Mr. Pett is to make one to outdo this for the honour of
his country, which I fear he will scarce better. From thence with him
as far as Ratcliffe, where I left him going by water to London, and
I (unwilling to leave the rest of the officers) went back again to
Deptford, and being very much troubled with a sudden looseness, I went
into a little alehouse at the end of Ratcliffe, and did give a groat for
a pot of ale, and there I did... So went forward in my walk with some
men that were going that way a great pace, and in our way we met with
many merry seamen that had got their money paid them to-day. We sat very
late doing the work and waiting for the tide, it being moonshine we got
to London before two in the morning. So home, where I found my wife up,
she shewed me her head which was very well dressed to-day, she having
been to see her father and mother. So to bed.
