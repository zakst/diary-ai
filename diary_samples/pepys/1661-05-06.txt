6th. Up by four o’clock and took coach. Mr. Creed rode, and left us that
we know not whither he went. We went on, thinking to be at home before
the officers rose, but finding we could not we staid by the way and eat
some cakes, and so home, where I was much troubled to see no more work
done in my absence than there was, but it could not be helped. I sent my
wife to my father’s, and I went and sat till late with my Lady Batten,
both the Sir Williams being gone this day to pay off some ships at
Deptford. So home and to bed without seeing of them. I hear to-night
that the Duke of York’s son is this day dead, which I believe will
please every body; and I hear that the Duke and his Lady themselves are
not much troubled at it.
