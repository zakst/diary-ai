9th. Up and to my office, where all the morning very busy. At noon home
to dinner, and then to my office again, where Sir William Petty come,
among other things to tell me that Mr. Barlow

     [Thomas Barlow, Pepys’s predecessor as Clerk of the Acts, to whom he
     paid part of the salary.  Barlow held the office jointly with Dennis
     Fleeting.]

is dead; for which, God knows my heart, I could be as sorry as is
possible for one to be for a stranger, by whose death he gets L100 per
annum, he being a worthy, honest man; but after having considered that
when I come to consider the providence of God by this means unexpectedly
to give me L100 a year more in my estate, I have cause to bless God, and
do it from the bottom of my heart. So home late at night, after twelve
o’clock, and so to bed.
