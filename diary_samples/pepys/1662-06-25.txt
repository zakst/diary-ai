25th. Up by four oâ€™clock, and put my accounts with my Lord into a very
good order, and so to my office, where having put many things in order
I went to the Wardrobe, but found my Lord gone to Hampton Court. After
discourse with Mr. Shepley we parted, and I into Thames Street, beyond
the Bridge, and there enquired among the shops the price of tarre and
oyle, and do find great content in it, and hope to save the King money
by this practice. So home to dinner, and then to the Change, and so home
again, and at the office preparing business against to-morrow all the
afternoon. At night walked with my wife upon the leads, and so to supper
and to bed. My wife having lately a great pain in her ear, for which
this night she begins to take physique, and I have got cold and so have
a great deal of my old pain.
