6th (Lordâ€™s day). Up and with my wife to church. Dined at home. And
I all the afternoon close at my office drawing up some proposals to
present to the Committee for the Fishery to-morrow, having a great
good intention to be serviceable in the business if I can. At night, to
supper with my uncle Wight, where very merry, and so home. To prayers
and to bed.
