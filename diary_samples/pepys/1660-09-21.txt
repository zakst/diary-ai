21st. Lay long in bed. This morning my cozen Thomas Pepys, the turner,
sent me a cupp of lignum vitae

     [A hard, compact, black-green wood, obtained from ‘Guaiacum
     offcinale’, from which pestles, ship-blocks, rollers, castors, &c.,
     are turned.]

for a token. This morning my wife and I went to Paternoster Row, and
there we bought some green watered moyre for a morning wastecoate. And
after that we went to Mr. Cade’s’ to choose some pictures for our house.
After that my wife went home, and I to Pope’s Head, and bought me an
aggate hafted knife, which cost me 5s. So home to dinner, and so to the
office all the afternoon, and at night to my viallin (the first time
that I have played on it since I came to this house) in my dining room,
and afterwards to my lute there, and I took much pleasure to have the
neighbours come forth into the yard to hear me. So down to supper, and
sent for the barber, who staid so long with me that he was locked into
the house, and we were fain to call up Griffith, to let him out. So up
to bed, leaving my wife to wash herself, and to do other things against
to-morrow to go to court.
