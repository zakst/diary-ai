30th. To the Wardrobe and there, with my Lord, went into his new barge
to try her, and found her a good boat, and like my Lord’s contrivance
of the door to come out round and not square as they used to do. Back
to the Wardrobe with my Lord, and then with Mr. Moore to the Temple, and
thence to. Greatorex, who took me to Arundell-House, and there showed
me some fine flowers in his garden, and all the fine statues in the
gallery, which I formerly had seen, and is a brave sight, and thence to
a blind dark cellar, where we had two bottles of good ale, and so after
giving him direction for my silver side-table, I took boat at Arundell
stairs, and put in at Milford.... So home and found Sir Williams both
and my Lady going to Deptford to christen Captain Rooth’s child, and
would have had me with them, but I could not go. To the office, where
Sir R. Slingsby was, and he and I into his and my lodgings to take a
view of them, out of a desire he has to have mine of me to join to his,
and give me Mr. Turner’s. To the office again, where Sir G. Carteret
came and sat a while, he being angry for Sir Williams making of the
maisters of this fleet upon their own heads without a full table. Then
the Comptroller and I to the Coffee House, and there sat a great while
talking of many things. So home and to bed. This day, I hear, the
Parliament have ordered a bill to be brought in for the restoring the
Bishops to the House of Lords; which they had not done so soon but to
spite Mr. Prin, who is every day so bitter against them in his discourse
in the House.
