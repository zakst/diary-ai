7th. Up betimes, and to the office, where some of us sat all the
morning. At noon Sir W. Pen began to talk with me like a counterfeit
rogue very kindly about his house and getting bills signed for all our
works, but he is a cheating fellow, and so I let him talk and answered
nothing. So we parted. I to dinner, and there met The. Turner, who is
come on foot in a frolique to beg me to get a place at sea for John,
their man, which is a rogue; but, however, it may be, the sea may do
him good in reclaiming him, and therefore I will see what I can do. She
dined with me; and after dinner I took coach, and carried her home; in
our way, in Cheapside, lighting and giving her a dozen pair of white
gloves as my Valentine. Thence to my Lord Sandwich, who is gone to Sir
W. Wheeler’s for his more quiet being, where he slept well last night,
and I took him very merry, playing at cards, and much company with him.
So I left him, and Creed and I to Westminster Hall, and there walked a
good while. He told me how for some words of my Lady Gerard’s

     [Jane, wife of Lord Gerard (see ante, January 1st, 1662-63).  The
     king had previously put a slight upon Lady Gerard, probably at the
     instigation of Lady Castlemaine, as the two ladies were not friends.
     On the 4th of January of this same year Lady Gerard had given a
     supper to the king and queen, when the king withdrew from the party
     and proceeded to the house of Lady Castlemaine, and remained there
     throughout the evening (see Steinman’s “Memoir of Barbara, Duchess
     of Cleveland,” 1871, p. 47).]

against my Lady Castlemaine to the Queen, the King did the other day
affront her in going out to dance with her at a ball, when she desired
it as the ladies do, and is since forbid attending the Queen by the
King; which is much talked of, my Lord her husband being a great
favourite. Thence by water home and to my office, wrote by the post and
so home to bed.
