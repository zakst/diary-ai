29th. The King’s birth-day. To White Hall, where all very gay; and
particularly the Prince of Tuscany very fine, and is the first day of
his appearing out of mourning, since he come. I heard the Bishop of
Peterborough’ preach but dully; but a good anthem of Pelham’s. Home to
dinner, and then with my wife to Hyde Park, where all the evening; great
store of company, and great preparations by the Prince of Tuscany to
celebrate the night with fire-works, for the King’s birth-day. And so
home.
