6th. Up, and to the office, where we sat all the morning, and so at noon
to the ‘Change, where I met Mr. Coventry, the first time I ever saw him
there, and after a little talke with him and other merchants, I up and
down about several businesses, and so home, whither came one Father
Fogourdy, an Irish priest, of my wife’s and her mother’s acquaintance in
France, a sober, discreet person, but one that I would not have converse
with my wife for fear of meddling with her religion, but I like the man
well. Thence with my wife abroad, and left her at Tom’s, while I abroad
about several businesses and so back to her, myself being vexed to find
at my first coming Tom abroad, and all his books, papers, and bills
loose upon the open table in the parlour, and he abroad, which I ranted
at him for when he came in. Then by coach home, calling at my cozen
Scott’s, who (she) lies dying, they say, upon a miscarriage. My wife
could not be admitted to see her, nor anybody. At home to the office
late writing letters, and then home to supper and to bed. Father
Fogourdy confirms to me the newes that for certain there is peace
between the Pope and King of France.
