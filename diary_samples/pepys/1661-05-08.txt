8th. This morning came my brother John to take his leave of me, he being
to return to Cambridge to-morrow, and after I had chid him for going
with my Will the other day to Deptford with the principal officers, I
did give him some good counsell and 20s. in money, and so he went away.
All this day I staid at home with my workmen without eating anything,
and took much pleasure to see my work go forward. At night comes my wife
not well from my father’s, having had a fore-tooth drawn out to-day,
which do trouble me, and the more because I am now in the greatest of
all my dirt. My Will also returned to-night pretty well, he being gone
yesterday not very well to his father’s. To-day I received a letter from
my uncle, to beg an old fiddle of me for my Cozen Perkin, the miller,
whose mill the wind hath lately broke down, and now he hath nothing to
live by but fiddling, and he must needs have it against Whitsuntide to
play to the country girls; but it vexed me to see how my uncle writes to
me, as if he were not able to buy him one. But I intend tomorrow to send
him one. At night I set down my journal of my late journey to this time,
and so to bed. My wife not being well and I very angry with her for her
coming hither in that condition.
