Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
