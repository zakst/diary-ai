Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
