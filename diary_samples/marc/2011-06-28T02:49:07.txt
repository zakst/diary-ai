Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
