Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
