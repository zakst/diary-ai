Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
