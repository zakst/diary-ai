Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
