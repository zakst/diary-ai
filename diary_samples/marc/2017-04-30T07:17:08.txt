Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
