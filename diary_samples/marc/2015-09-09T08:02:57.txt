Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
