Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
