Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
