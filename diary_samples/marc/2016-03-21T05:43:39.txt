Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
