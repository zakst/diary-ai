Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
