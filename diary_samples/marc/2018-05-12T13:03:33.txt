Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
