Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
