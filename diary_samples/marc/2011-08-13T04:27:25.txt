Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
