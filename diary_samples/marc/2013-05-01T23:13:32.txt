Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
