Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
