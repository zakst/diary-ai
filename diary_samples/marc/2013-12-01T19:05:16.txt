Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
