Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
