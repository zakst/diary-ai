Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
