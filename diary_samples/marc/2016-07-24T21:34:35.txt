Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
