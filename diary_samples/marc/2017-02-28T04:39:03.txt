Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
