Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
