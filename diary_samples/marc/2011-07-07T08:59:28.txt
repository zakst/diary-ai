Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
