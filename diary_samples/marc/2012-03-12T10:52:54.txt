Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
