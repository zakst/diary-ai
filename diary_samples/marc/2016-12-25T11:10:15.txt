Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
