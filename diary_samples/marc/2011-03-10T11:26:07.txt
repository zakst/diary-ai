Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
