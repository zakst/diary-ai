Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
