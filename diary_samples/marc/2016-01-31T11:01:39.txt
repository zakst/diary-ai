Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
