Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
