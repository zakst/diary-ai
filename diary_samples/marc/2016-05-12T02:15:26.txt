Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
