Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
