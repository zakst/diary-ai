Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
