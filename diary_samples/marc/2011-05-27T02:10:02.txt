Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
