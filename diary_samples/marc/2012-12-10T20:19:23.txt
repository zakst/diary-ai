Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
