Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
