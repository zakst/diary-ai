Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
