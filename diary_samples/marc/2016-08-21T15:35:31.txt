Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
