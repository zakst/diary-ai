Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
