Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.

Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
