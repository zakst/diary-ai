Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
