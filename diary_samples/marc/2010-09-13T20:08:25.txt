Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
