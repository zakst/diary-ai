Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
