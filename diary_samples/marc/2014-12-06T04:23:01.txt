Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
