Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
