Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
