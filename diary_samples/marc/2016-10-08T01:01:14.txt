Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
