Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
