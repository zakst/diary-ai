Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
