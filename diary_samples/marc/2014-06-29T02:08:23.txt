Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
