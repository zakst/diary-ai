Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
