Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
