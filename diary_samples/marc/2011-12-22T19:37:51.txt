Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
