Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
