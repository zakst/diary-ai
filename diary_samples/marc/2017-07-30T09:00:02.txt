Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
