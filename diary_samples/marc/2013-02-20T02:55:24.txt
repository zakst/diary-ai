Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
