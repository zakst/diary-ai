Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
