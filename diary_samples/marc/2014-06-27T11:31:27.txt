Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
