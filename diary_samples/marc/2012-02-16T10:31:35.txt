Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
