Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
