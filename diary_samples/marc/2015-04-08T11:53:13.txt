Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
