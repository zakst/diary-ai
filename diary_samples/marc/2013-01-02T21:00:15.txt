Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
