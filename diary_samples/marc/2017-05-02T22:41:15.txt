Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
