Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
