Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
