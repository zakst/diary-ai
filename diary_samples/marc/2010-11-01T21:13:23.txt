Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
