Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
