Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
