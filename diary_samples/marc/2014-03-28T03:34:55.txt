Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
