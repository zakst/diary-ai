Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
