Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
