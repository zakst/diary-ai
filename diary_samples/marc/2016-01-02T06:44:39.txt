Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
