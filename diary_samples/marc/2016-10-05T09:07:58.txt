Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
