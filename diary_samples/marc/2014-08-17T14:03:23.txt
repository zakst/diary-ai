Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
