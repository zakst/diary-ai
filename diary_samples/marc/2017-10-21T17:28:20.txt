Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
