Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
