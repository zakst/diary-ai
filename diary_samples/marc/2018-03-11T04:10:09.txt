Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
