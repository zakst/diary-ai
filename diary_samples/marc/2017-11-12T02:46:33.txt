Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
