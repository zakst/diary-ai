Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
