Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
