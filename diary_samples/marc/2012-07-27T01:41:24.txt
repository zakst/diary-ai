Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
