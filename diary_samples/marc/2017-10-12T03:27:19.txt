Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
