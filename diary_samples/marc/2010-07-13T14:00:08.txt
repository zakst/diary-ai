Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
