Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
