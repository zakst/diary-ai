Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
