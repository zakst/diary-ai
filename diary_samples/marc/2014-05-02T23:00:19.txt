Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
