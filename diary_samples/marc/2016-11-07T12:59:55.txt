Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
