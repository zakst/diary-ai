Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
