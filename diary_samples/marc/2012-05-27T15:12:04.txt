Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
