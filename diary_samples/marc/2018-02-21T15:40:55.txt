Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
