Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
