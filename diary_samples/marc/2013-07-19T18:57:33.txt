Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
