Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
