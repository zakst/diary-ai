Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
