Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
