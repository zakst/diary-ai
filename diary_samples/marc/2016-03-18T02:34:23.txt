Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
