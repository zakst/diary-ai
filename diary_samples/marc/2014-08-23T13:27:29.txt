Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
