Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
