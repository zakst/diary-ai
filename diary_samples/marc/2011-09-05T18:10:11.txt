Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
