Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
