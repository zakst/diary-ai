Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
