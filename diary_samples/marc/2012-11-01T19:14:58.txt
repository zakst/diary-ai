Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
