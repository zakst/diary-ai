Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
