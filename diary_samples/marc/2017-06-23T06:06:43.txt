Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
