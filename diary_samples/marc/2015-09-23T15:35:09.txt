Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
