Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
