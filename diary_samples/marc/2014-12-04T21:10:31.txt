Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
