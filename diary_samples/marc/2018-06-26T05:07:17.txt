Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
