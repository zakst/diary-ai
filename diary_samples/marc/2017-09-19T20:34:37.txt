Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
