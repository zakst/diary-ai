Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
