Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
