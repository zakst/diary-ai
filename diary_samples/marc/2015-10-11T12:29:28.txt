Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
