Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
