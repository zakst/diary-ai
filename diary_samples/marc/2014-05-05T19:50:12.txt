Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
