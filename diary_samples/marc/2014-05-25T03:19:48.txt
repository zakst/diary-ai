Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
