Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
