Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
