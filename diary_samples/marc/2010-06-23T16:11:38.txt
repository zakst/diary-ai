Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
