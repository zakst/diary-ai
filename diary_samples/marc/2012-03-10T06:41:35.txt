Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
