Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
