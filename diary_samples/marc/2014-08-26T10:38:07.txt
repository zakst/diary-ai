Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
