Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
