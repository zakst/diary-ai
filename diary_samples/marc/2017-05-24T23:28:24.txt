Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
