Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
