Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
