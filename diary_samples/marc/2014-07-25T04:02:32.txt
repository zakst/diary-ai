Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
