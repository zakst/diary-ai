Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
