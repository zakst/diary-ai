Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
