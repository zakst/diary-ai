Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
