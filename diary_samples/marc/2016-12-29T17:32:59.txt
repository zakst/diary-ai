Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
