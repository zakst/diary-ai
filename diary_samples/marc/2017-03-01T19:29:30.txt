Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
