Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
