Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
