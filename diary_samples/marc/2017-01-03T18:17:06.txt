Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
