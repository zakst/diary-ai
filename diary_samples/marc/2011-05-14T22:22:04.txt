Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
