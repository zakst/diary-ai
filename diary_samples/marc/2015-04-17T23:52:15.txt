Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
