Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
