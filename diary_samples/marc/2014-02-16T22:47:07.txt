Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
