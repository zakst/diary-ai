Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
