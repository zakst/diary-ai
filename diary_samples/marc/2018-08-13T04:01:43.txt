Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
