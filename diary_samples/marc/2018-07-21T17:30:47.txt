Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
