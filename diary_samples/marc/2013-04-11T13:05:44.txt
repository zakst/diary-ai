Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
