Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
