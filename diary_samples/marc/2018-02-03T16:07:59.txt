Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
