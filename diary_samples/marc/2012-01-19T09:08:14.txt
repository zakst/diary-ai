Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
