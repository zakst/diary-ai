Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
