Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
