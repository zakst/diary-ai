Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
