Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
