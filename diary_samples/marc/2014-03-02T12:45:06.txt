Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
