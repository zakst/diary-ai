Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
