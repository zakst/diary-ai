Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
