Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
