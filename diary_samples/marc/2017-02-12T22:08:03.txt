Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
