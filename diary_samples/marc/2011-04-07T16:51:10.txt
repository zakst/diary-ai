Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
