Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
