Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
