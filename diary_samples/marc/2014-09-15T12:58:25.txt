Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
