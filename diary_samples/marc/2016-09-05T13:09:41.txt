Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
