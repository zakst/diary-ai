Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
