Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
