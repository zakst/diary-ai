Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
