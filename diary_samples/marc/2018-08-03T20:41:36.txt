Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
