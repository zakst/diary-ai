Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
