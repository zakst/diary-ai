Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
