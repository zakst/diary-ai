Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
