Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
