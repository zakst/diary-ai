Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
