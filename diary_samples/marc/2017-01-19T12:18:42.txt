Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
