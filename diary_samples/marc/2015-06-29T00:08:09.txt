Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
