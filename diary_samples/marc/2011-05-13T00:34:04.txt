Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
