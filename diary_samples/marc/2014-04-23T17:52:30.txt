Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
