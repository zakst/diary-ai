Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
