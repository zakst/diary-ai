Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
