Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
