Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
