Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
