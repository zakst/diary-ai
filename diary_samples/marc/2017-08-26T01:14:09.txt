Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
