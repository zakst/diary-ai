Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
