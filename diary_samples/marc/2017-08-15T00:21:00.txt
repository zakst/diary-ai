Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
