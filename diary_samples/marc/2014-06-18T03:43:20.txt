Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
