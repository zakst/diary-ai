Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
