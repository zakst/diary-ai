Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
