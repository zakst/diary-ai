Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
