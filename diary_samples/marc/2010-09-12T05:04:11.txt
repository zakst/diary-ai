Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
