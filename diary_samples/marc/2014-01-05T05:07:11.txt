Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
