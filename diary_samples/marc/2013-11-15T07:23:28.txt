Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
