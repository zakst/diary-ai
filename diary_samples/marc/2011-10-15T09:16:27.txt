Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
