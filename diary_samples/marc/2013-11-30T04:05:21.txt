Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
