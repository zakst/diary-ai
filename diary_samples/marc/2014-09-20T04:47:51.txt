Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
