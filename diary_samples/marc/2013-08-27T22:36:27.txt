Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
