Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
