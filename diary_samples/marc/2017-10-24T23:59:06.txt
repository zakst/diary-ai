Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
