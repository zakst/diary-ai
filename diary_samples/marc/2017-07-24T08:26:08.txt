Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
