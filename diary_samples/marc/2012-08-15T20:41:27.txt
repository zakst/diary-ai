Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
