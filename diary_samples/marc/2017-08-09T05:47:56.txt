Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
