Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
