Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
