Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
