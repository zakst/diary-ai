Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
