Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
