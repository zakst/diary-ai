Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
