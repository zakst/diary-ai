Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
