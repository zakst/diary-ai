Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
