Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
