Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
