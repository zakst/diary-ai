Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
