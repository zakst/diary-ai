Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
