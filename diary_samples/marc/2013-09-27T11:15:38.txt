Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
