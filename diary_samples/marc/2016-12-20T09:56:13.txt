Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
