Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
