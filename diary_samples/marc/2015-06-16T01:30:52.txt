Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
