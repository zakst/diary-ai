Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
