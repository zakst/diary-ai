Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
