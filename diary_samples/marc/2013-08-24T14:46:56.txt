Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
