Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
