Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
