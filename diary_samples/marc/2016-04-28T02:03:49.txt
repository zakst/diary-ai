Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
