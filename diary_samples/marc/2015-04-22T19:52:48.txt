Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
