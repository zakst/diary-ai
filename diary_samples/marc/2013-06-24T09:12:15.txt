Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
