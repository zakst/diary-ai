Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
