Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
