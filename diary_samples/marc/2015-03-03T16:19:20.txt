Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
