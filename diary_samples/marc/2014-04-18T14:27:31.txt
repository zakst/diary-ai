Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
