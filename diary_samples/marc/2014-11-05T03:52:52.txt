Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
