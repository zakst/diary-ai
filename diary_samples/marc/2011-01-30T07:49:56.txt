Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
