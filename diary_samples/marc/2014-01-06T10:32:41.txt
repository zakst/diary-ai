Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
