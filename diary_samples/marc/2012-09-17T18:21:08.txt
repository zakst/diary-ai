Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
