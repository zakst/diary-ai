Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
