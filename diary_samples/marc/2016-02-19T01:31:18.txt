Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
