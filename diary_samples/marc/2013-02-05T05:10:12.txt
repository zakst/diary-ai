Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
