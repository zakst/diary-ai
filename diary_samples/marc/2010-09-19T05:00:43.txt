Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
