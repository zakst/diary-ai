Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
