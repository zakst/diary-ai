Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
