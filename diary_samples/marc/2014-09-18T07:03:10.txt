Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
