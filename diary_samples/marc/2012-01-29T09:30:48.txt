Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
