Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
