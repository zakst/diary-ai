Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
