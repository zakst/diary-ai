Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
