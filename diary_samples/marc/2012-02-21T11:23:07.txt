Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
