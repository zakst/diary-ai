Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
