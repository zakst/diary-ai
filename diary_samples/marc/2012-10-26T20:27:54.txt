Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
