Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
