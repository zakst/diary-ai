Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
