Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
