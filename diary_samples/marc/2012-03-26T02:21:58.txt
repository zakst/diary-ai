Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
