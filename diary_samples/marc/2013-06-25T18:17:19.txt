Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
