Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
