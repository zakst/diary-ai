Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
