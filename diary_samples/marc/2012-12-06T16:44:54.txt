Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
