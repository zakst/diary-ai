Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
