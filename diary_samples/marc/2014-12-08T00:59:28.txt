Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
