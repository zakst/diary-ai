Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
