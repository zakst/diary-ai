Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
