Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
