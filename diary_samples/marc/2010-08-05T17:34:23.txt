Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
