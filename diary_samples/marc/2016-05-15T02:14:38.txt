Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
