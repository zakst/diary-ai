Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
