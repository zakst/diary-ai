Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
