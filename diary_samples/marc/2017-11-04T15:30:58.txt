Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
