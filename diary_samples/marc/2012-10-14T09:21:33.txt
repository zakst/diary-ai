Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
