Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
