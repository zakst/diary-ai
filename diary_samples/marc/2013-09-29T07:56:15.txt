Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
