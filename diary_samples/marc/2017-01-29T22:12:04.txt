Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
