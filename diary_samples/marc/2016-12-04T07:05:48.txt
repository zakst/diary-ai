Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
