Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
