Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
