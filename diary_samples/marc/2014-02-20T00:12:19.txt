Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
