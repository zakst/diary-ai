Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
