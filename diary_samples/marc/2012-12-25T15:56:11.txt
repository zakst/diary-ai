Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
