Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
