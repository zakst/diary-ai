Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
