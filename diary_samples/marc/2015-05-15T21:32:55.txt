Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
