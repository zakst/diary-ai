Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
