Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
