Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
