Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
