Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
