Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
