Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
