Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
