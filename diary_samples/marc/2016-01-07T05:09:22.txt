Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
