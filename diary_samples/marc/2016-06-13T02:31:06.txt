Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
