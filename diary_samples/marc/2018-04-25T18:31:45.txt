Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
