Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
