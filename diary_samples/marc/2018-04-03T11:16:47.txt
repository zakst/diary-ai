Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
