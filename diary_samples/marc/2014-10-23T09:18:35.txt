Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
