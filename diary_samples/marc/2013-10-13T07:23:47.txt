Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
