Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
