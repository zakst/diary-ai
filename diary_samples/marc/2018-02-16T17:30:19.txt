Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
