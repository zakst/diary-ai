Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
