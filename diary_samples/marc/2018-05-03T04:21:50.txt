Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
