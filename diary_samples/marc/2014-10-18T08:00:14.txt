Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
