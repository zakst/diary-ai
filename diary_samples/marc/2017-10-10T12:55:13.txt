Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
