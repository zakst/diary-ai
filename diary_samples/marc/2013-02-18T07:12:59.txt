Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
