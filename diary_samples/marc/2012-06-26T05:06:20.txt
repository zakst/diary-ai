Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
