Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
