Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
