Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
