Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
