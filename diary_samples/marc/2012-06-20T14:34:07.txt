Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
