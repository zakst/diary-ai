Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
