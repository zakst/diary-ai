Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
