Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
