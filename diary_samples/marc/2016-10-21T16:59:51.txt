Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
