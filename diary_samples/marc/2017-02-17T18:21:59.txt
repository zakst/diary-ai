Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
