Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
