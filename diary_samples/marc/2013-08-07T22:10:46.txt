Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
