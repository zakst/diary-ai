Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
