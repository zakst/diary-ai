Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
