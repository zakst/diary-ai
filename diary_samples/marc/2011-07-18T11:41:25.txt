Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
