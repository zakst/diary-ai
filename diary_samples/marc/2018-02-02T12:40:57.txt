Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
