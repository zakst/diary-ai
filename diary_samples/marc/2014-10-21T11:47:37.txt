Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
