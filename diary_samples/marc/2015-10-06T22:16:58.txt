Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
