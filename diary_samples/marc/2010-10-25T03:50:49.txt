Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
