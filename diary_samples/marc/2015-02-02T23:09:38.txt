Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
