Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
