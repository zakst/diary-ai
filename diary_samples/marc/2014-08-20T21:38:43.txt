Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
