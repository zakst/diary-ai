Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
