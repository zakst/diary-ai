Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
