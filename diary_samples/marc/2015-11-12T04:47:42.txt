Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
