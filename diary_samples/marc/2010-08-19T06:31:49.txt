Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
