Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
