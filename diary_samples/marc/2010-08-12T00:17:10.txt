Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
