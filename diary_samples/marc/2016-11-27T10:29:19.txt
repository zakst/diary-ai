Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
