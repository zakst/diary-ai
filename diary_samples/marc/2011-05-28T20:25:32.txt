Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
