Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
