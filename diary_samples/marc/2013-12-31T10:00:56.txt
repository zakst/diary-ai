Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
