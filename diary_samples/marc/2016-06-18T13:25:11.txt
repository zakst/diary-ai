Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
