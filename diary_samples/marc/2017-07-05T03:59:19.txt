Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
