Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
