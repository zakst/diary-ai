Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
