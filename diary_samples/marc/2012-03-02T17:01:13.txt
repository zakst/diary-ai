Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
