Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
