Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
