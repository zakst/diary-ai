Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
