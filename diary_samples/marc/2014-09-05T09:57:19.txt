Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
