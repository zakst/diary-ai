Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
