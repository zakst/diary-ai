Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
