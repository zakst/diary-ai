Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
