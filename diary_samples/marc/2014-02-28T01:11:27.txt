Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
