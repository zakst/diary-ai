Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
