Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
