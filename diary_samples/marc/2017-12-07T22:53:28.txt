Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
