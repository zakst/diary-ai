Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
