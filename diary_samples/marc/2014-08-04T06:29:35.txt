Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
