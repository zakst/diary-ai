Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
