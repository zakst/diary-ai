Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
