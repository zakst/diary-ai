Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
