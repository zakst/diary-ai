Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
