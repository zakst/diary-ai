Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
