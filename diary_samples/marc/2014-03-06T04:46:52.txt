Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
