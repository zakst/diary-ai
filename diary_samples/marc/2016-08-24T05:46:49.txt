Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
