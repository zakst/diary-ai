Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
