Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
