Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
