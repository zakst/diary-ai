Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
