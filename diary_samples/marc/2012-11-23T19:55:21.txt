Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
