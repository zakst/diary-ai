Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
