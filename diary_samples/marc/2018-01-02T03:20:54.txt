Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
