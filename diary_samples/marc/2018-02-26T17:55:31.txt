Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
