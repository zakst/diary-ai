Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
