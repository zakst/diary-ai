Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
