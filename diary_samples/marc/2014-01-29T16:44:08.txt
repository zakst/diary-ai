Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
