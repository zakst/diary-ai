Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
