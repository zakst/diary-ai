Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
