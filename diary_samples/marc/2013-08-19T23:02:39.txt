Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
