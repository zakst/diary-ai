Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
