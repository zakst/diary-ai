Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
