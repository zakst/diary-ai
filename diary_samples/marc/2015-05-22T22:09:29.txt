Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
