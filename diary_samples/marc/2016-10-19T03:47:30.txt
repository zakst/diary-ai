Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
