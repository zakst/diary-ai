Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
