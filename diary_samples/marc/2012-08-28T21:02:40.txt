Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
