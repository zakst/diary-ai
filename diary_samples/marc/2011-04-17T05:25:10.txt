Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
