Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
