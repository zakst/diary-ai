Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
