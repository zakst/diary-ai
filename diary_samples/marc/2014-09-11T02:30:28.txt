Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
