Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
