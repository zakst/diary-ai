Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
