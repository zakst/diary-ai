Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
