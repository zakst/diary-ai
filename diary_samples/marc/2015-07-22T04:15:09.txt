Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
