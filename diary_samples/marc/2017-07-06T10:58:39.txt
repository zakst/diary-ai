Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
