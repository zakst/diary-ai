Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
