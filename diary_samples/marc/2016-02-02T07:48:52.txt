Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
