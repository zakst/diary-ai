Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
