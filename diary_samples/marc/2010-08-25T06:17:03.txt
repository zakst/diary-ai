Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
