Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
