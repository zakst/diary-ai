Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
