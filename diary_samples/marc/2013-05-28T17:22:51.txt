Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
