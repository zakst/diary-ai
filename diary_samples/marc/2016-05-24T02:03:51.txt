Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
