Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
