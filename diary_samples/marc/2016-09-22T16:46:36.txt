Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
