Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
