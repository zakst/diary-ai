Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
