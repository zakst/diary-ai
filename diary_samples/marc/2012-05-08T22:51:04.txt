Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
