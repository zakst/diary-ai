Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
