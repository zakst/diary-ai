Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
