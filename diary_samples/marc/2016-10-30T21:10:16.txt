Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
