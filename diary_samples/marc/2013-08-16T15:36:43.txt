Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
