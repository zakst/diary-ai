Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
