Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
