Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
