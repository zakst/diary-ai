Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
