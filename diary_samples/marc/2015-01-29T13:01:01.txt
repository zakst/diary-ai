Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
