Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
