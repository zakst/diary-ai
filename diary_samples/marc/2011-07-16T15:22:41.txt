Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
