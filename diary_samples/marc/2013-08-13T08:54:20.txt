Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.

Now, I almost look forward to it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
