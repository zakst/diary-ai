Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
