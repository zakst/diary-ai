Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
