Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
