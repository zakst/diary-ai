Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
