Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
