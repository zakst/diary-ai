Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
