Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
