Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
