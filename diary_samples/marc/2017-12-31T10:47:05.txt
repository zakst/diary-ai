Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
