Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
