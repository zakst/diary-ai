Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
