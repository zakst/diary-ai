Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
