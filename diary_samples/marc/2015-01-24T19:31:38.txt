Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
