Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
