Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
