Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
