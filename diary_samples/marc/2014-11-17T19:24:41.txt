Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
