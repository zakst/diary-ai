Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
