Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
