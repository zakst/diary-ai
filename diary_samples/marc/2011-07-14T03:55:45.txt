Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
