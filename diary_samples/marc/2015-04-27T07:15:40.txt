Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
