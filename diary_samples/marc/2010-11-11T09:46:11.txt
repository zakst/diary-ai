Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
