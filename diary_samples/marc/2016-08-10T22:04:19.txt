Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
