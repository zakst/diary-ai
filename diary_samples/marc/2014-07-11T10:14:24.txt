Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
