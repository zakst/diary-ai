Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
