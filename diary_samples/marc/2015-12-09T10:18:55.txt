Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
