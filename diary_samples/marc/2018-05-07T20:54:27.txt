Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
