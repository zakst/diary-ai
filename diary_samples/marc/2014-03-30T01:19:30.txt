Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
