Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
