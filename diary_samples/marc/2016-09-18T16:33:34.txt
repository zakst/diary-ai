Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
