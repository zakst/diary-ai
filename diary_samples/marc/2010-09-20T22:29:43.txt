Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
