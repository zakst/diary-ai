Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
