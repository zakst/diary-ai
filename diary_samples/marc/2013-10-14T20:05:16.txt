Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
