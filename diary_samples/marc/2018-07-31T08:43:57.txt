Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
