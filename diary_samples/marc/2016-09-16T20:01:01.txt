Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
