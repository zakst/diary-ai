Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
