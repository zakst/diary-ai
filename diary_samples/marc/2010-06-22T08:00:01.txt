Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
