Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
