Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
