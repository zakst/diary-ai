Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
