Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
