Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
