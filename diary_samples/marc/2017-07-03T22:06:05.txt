Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
