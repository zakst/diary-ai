Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
