Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
