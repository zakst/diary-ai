Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
