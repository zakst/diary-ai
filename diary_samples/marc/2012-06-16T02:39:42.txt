Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
