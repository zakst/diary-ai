Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
