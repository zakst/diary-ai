Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
