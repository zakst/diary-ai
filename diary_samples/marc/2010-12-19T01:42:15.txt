Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
