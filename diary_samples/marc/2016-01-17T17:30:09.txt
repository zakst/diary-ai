Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
