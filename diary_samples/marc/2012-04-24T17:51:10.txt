Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
