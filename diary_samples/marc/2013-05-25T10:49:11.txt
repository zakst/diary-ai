Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
