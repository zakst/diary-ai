Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
