Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
