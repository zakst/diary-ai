Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
