Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
