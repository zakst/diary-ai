Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
