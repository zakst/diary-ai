Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
