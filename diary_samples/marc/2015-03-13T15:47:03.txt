Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
