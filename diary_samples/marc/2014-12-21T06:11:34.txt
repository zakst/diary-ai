Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
