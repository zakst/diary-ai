Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
