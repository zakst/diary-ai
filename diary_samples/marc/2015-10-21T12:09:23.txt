Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
