Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
