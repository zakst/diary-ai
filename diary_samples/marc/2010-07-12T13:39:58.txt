Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
