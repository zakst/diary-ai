Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
