Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
