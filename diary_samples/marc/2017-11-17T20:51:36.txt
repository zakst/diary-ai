Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
