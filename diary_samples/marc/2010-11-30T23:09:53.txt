Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
