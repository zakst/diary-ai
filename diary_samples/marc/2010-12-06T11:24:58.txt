Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
