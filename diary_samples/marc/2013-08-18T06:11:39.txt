Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
