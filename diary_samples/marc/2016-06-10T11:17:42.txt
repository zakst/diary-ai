Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
