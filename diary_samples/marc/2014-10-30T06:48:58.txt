Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
