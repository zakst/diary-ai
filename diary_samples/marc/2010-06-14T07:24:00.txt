Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
