Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.

She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
