Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
