Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
