Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
