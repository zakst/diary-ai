Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
