Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
