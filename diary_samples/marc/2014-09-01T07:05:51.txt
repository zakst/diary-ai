Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
