Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
