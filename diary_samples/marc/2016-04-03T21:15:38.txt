Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
