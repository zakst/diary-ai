Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
