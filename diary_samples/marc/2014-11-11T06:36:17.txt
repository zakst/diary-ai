Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
