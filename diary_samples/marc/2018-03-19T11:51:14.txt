Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
