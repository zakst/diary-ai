Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
