Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
