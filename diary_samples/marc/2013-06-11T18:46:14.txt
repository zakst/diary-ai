Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
