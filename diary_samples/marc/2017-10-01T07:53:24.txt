Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
