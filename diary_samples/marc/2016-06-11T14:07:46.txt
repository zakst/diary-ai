Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
