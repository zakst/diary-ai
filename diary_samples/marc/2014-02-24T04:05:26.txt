Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
