Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
