Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
