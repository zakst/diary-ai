Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
