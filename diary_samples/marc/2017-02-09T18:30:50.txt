Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
