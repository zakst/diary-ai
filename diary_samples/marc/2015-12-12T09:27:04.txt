Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
