Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
