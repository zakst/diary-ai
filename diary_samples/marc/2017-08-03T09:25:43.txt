Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
