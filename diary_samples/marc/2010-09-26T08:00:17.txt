Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
