Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
