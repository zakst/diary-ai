Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
