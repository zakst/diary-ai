Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
