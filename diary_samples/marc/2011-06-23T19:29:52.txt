Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
