Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
