Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
