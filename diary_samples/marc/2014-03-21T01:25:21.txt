Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
