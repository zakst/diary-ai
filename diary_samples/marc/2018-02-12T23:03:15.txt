Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
