Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
