Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
