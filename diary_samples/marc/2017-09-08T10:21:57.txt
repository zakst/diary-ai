Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
