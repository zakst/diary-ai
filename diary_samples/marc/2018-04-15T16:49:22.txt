Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
