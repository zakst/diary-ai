Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
