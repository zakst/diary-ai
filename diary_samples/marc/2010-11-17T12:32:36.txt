Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
