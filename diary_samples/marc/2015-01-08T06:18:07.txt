Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
