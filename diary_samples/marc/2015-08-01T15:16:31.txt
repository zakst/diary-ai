Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
