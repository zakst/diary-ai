Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
