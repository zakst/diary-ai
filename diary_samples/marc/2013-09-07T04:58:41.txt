Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
