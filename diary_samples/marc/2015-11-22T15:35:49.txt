Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
