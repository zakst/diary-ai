Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
