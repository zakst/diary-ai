Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
