Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
