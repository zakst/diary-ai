Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
