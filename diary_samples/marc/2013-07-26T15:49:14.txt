Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
