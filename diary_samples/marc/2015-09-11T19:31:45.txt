Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
