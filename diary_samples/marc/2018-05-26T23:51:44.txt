Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
