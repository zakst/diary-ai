Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
