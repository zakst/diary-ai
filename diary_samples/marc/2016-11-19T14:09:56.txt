Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
