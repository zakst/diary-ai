Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
