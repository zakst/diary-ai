Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
