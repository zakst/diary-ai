Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
