Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
