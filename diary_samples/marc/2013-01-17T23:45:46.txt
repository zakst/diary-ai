Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
