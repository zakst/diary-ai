Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
