Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
