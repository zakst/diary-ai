Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
