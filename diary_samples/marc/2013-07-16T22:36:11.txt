Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
