Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
