Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
