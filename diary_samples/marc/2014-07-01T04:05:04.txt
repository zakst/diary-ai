Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
