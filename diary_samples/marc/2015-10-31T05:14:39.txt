Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
