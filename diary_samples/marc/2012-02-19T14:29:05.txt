Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
