Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
