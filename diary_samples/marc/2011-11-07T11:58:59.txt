Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
