Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
