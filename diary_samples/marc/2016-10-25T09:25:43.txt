Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
