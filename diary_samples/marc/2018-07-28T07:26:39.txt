Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
