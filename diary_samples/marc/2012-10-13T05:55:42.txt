Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
