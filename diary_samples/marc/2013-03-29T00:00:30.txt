Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
