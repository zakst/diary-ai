Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
