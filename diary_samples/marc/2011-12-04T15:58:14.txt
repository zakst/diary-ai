Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
