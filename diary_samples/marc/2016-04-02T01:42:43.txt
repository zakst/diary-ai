Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
