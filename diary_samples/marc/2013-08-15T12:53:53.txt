Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
