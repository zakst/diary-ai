Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
