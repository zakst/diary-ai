Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
