Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
