Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
