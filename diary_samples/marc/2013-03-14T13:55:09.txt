Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
