Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
