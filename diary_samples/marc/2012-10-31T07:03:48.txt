Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
