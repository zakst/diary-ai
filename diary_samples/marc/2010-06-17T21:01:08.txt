Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
