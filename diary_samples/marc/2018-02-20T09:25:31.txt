Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
