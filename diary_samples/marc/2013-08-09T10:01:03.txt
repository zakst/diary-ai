Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
