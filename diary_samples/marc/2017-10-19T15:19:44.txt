Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
