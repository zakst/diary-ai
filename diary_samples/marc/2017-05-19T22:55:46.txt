Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
