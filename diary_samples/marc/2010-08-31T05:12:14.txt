Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
