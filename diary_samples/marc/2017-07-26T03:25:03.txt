Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
