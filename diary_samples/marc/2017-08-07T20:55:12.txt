Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.

It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
