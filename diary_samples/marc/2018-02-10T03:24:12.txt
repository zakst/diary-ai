Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
