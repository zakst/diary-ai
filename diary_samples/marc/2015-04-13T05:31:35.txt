Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
