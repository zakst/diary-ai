Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
