Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
