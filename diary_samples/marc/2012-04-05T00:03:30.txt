Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
