Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
