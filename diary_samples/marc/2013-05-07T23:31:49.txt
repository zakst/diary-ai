Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
