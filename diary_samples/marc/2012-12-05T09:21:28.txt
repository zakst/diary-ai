Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
