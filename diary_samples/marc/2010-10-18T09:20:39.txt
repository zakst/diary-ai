Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
