Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
