Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
