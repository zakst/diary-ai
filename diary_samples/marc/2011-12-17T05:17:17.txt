Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
