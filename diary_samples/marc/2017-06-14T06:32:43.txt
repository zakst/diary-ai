Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
