Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
