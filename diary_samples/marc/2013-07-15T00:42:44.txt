Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
