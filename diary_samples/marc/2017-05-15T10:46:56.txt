Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
