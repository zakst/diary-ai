Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
