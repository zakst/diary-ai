Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
