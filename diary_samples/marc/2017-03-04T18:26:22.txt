Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
