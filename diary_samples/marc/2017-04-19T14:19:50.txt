Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
