Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.

I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.

No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
