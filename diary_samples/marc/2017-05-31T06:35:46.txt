Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
