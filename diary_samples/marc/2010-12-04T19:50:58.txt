Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
