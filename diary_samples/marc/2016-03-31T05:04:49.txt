Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
