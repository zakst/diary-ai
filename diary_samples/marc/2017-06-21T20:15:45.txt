Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
