Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
