Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
