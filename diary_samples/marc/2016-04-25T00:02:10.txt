Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
