Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
