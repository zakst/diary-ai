Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
