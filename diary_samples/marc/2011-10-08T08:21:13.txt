Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
