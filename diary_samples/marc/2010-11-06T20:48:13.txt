Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
