Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
