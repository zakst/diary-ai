Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
