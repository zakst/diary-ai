Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
