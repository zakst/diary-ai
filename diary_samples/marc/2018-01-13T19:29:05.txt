Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
