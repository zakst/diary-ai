Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
