Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
