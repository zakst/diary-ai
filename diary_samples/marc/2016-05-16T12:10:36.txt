Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
