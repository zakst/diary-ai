Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
