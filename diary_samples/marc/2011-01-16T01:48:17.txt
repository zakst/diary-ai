Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
