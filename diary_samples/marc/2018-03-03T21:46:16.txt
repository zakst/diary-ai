Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
