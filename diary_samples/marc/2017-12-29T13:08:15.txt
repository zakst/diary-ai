Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
