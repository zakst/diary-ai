Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
