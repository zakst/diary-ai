Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
