Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
