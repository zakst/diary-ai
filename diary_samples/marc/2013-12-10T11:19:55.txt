Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
