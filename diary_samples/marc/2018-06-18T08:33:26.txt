Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
