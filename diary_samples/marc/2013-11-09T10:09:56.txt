Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
