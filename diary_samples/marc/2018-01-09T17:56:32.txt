Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
