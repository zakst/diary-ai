Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
