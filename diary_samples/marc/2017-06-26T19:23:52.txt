Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
