Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
