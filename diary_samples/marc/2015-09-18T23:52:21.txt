Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
