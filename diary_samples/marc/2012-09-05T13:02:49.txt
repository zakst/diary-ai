Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
