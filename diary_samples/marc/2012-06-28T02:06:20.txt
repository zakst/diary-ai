Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
