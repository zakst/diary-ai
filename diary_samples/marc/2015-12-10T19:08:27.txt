Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
