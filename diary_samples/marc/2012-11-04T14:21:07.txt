Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
