Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
