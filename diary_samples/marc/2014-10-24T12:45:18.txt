Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
