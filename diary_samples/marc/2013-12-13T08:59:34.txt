Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
