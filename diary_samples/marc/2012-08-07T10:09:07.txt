Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
