Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
