Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
