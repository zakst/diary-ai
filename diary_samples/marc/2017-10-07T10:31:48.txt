Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
