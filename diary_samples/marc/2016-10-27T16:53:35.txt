Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
