Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
