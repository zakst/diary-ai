Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
