Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
