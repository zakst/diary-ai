Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
