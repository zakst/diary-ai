Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
