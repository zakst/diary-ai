Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
