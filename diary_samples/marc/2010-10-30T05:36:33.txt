Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
