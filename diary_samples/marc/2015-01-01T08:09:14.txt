Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
