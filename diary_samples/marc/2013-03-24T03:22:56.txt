Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
