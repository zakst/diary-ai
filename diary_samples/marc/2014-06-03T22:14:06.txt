Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
