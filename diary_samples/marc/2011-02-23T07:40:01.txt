Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
