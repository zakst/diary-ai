Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
