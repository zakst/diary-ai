Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
