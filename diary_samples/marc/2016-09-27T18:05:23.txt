Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
