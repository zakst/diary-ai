Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
