Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
