Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
