Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
