Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
