Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
