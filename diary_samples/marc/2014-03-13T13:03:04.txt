Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
