Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
