Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
