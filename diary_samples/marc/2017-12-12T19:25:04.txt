Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
