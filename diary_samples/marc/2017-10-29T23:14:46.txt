Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
