Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
