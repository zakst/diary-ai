Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
