Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
