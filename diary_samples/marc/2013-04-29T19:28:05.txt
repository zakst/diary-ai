Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
