Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
