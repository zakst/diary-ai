Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
