Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
