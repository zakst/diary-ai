Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
