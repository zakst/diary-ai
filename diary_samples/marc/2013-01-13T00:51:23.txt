Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
