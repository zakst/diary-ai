Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
