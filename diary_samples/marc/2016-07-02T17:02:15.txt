Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
