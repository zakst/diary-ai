Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
