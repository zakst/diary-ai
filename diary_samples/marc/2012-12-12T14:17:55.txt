Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
