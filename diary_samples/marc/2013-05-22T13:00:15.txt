Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
