Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
