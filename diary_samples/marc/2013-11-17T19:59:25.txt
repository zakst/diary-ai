Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
