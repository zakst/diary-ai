Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.

Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
