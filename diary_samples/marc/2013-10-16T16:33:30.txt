Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
