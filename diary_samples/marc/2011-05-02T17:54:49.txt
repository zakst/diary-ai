Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
