Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
