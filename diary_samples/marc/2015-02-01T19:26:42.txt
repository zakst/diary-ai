Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
