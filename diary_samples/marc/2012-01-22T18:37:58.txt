Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
