Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
