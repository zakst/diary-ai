Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
