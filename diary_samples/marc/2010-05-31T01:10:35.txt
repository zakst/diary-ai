Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
