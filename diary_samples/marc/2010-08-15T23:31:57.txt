Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
