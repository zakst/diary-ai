Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
