Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
