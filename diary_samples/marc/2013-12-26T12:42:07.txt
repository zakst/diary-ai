Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
