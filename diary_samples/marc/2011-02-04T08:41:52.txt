Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
