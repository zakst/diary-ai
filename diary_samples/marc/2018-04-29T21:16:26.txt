Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
