Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
