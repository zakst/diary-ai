Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
