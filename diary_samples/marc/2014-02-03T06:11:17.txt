Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
