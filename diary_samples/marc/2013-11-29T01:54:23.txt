Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
