Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
