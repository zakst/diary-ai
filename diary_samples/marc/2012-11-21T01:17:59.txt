Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
