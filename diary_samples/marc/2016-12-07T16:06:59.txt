Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
