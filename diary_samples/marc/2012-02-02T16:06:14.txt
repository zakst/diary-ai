Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
