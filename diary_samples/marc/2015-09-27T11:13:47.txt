Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
