Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
