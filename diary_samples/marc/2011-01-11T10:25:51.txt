Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
