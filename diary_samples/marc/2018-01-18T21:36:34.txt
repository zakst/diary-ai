Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
