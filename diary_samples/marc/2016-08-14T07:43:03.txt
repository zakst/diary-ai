Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
