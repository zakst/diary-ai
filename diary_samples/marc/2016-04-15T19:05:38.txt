Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
