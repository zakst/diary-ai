Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
