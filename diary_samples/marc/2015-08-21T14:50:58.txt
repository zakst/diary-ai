Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
