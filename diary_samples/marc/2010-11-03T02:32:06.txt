Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
