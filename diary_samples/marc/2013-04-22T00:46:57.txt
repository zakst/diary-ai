Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
