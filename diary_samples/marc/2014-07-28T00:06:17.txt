Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
