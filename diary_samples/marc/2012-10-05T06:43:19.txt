Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
