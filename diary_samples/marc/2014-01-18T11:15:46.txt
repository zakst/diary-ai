Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
