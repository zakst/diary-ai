Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
