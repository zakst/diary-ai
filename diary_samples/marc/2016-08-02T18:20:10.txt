Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
