Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
