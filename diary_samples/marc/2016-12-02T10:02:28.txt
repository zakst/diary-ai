Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
