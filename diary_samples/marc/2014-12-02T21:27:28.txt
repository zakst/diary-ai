Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
