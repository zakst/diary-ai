Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
