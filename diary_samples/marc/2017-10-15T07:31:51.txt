Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
