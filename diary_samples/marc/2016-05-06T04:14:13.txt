Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
