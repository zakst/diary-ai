Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
