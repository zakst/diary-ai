Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
