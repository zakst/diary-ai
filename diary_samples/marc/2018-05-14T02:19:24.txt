Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
