Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
