Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
