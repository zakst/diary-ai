Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
