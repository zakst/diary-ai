Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
