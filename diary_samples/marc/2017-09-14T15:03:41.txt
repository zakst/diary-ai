Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
