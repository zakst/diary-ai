Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
