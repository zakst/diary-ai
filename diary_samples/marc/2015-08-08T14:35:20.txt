Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
