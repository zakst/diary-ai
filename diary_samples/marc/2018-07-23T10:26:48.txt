Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
