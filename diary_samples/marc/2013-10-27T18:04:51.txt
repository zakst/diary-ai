Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
