Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
