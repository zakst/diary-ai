Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
