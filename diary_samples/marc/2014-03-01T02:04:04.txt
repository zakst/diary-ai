Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
