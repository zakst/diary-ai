Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
