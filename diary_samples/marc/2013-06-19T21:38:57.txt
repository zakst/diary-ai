Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
