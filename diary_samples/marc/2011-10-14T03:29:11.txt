Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
