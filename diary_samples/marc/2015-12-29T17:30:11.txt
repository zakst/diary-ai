Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
