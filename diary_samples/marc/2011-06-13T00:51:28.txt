Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
