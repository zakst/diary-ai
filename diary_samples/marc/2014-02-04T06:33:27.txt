Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
