Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
