Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
