Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
