Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
