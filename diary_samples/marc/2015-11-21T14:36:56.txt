Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
