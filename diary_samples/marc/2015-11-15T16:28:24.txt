Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
