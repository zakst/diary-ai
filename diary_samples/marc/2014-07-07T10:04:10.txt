Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
