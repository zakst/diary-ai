Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
