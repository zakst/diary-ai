Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
