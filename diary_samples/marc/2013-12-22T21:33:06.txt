Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
