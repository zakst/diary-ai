Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
