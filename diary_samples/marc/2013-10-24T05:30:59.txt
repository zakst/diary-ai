Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
