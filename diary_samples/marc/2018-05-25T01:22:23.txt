Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
