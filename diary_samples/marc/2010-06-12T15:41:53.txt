Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
