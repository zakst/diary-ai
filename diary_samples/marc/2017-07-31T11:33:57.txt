Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
