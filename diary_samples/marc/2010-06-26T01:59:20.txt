Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
