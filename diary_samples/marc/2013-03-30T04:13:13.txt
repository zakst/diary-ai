Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
