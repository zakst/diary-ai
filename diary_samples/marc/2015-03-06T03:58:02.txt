Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
