Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
