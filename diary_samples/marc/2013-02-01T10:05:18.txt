Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
