Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
