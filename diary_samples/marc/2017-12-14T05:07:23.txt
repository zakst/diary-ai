Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
