Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
