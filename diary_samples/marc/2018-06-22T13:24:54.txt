Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
