Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
