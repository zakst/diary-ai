Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.

She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
