Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year.

The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
