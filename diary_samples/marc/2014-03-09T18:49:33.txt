Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
