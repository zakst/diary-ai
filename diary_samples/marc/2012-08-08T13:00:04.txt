Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
