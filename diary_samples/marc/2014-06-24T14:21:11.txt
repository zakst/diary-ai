Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
