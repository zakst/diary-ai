Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
