Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
