Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
