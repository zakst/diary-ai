Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
