Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
