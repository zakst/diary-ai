Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
