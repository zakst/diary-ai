Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
