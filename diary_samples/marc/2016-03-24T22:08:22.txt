Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
