Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
