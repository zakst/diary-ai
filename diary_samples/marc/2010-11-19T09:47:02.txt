Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
