Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
