Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
