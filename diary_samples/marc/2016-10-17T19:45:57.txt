Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
