Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
