Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
