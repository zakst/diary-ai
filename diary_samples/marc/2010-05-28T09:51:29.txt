Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
