Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
