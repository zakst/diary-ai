Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
