Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
