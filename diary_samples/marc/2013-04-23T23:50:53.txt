Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
