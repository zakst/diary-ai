Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
