Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
