Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
