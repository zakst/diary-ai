Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
