Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
