Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
