Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
