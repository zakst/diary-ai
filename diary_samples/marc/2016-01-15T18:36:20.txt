Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
