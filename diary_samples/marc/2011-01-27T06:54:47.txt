Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
