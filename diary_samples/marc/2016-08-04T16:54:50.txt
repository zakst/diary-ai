Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
