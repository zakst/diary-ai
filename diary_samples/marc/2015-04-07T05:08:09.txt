Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
