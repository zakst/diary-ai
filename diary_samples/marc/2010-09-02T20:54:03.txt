Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
