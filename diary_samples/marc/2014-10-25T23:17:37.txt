Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
