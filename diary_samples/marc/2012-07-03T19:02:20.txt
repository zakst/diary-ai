Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
