Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
