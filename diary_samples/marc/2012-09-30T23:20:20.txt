Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
