Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
