Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
