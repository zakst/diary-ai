Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
