Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
