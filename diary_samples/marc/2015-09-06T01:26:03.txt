Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
