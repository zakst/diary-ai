Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
