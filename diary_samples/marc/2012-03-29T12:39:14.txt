Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
