Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
