Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
