Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
