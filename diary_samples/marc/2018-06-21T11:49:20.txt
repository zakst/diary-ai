Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
