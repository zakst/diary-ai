Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Presented my findings at a small conference.

My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
