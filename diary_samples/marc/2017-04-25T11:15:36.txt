Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
