Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
