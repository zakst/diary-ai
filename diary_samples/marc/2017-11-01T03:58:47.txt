Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
