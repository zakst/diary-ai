Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
