Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
