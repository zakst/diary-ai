Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
