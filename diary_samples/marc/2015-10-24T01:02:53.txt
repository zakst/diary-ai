Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
