Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
