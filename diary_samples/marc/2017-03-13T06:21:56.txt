Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
