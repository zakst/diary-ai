Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
