Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
