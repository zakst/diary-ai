Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
