Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
