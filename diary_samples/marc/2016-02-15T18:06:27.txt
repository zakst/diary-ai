Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
