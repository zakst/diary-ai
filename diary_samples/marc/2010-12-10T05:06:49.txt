Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
