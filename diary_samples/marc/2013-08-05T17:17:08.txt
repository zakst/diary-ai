Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
