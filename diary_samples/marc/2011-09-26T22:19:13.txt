Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
