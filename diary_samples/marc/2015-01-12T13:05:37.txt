Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
