Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
