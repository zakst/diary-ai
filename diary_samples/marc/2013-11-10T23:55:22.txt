Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
