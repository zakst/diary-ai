Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
