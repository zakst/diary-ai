Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
