Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
