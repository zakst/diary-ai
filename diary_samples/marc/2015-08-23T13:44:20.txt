Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
