Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves.
