Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
