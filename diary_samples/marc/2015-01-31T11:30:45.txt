Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
