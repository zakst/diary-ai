Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
