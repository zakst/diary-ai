Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
