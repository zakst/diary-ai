Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
