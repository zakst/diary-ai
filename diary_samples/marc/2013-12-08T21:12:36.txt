Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
