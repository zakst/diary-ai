Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
