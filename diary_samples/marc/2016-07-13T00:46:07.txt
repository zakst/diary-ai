Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
