Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
