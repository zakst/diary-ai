Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
