Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
