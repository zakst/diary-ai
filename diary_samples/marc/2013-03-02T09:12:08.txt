Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
