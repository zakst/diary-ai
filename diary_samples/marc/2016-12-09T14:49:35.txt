Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
