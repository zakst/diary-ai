Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
