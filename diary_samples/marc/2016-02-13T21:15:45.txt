Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
