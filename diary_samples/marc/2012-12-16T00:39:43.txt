Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
