Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
