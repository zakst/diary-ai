Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
