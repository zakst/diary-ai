Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
