Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
