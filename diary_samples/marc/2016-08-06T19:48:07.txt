Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
