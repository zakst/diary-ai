Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
