Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
