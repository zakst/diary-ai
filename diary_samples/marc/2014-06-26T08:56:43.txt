Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
