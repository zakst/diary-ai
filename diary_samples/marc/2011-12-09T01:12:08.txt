Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
