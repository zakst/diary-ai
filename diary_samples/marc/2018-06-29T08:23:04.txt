Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
