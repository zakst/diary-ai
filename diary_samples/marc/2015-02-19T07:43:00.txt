Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
