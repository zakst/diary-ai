Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
