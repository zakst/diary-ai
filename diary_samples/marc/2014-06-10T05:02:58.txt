Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
