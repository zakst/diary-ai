Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
