Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
