Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
