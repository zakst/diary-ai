Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
