Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
