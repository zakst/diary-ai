Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
