Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
