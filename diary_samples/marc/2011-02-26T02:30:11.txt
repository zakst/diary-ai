Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
