Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
