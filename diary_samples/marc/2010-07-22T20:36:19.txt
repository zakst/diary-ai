Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
