Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
