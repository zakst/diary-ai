Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
