Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
