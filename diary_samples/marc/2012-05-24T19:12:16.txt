Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
