Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
