Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
