Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
