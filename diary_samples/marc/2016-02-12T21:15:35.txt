Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
