Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
