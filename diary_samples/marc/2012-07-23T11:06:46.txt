Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
