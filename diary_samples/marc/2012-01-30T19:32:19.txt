Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
