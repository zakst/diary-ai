Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
