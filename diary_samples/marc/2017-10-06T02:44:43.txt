Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
