Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
