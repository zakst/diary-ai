Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
