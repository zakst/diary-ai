Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
