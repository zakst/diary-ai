Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
