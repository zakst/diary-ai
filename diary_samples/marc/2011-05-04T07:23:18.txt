Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
