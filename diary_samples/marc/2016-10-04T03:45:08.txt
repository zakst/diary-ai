Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
