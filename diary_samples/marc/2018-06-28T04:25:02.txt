Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
