Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
