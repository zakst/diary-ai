Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
