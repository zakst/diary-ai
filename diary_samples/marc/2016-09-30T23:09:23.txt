Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
