Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
