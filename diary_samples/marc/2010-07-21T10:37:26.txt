Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
