Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
