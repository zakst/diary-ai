Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
