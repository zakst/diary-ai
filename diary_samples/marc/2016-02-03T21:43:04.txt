Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
