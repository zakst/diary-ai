Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
