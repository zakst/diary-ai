Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
