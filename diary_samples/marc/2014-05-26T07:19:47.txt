Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
