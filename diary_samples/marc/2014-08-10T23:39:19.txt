Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
