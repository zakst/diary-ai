Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
