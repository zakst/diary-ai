Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
