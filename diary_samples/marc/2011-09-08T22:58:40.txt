Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
