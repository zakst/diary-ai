Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
