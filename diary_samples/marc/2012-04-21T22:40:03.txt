Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
