Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
