Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
