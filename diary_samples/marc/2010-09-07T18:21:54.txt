Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
