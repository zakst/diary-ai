Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
