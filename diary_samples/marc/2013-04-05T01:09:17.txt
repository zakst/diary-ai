Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
