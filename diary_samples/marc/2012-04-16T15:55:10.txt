Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
