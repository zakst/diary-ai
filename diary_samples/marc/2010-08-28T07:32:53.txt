Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
