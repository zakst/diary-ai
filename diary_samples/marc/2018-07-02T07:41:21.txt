Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
