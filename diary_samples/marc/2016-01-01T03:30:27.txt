Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
