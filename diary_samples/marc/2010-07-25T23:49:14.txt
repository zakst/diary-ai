Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
