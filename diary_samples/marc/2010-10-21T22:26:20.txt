Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
