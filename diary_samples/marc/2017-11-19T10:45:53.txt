Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
