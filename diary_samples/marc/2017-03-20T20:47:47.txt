Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
