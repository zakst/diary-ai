Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
