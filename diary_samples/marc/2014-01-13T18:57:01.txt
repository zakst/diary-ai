Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
