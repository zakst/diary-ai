Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
