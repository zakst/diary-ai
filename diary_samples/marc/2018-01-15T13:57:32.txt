Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
