Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
