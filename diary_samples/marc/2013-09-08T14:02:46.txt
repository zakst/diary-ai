Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
