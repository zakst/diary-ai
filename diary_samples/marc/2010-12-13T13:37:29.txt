Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
