Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
