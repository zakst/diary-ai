Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
