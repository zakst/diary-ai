Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
