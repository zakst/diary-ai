Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
