Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
