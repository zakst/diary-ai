Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
