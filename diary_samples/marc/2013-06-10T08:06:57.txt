Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
