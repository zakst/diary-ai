Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
