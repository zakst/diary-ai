Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
