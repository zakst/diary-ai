Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
