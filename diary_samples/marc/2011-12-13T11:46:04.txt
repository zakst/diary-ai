Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
