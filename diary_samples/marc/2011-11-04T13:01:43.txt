Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
