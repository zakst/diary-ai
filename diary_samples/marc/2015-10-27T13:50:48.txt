Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
