Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
