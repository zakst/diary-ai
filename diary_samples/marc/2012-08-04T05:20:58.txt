Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
