Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
