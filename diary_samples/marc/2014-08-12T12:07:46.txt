Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
