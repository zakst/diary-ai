Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
