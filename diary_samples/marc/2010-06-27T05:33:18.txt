Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
