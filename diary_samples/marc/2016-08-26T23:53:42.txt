Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
