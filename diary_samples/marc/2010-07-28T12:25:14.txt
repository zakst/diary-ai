Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
