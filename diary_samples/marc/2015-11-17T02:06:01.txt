Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
