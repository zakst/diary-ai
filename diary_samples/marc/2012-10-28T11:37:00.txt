Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
