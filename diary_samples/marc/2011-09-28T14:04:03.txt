Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time.
