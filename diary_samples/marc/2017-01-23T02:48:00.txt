Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
