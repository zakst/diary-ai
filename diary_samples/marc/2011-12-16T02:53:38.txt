Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
