Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
