Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
