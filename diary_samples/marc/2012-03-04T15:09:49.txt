Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
