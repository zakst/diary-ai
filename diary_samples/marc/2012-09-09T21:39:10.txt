Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
