Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
