Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
