Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
