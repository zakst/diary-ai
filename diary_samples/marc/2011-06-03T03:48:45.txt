Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
