Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
