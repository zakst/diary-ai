Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
