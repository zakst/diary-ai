Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
