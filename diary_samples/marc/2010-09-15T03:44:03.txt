Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
