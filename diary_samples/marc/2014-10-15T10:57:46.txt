Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
