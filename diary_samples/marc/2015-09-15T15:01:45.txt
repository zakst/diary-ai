Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
