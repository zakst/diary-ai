Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
