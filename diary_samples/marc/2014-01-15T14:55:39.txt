Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
