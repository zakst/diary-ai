Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
