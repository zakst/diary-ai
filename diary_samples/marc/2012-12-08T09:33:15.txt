Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
