Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
