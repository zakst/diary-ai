Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
