Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
