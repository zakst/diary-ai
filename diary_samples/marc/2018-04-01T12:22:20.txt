Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
