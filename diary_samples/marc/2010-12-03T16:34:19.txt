Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
