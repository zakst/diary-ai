Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
