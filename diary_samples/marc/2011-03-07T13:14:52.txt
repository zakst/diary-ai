Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
