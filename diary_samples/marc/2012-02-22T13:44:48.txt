Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
