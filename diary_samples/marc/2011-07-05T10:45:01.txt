Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
