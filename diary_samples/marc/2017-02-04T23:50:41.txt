Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
