Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
