Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
