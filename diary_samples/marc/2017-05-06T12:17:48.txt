Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
