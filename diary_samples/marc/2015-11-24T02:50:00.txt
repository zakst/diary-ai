Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
