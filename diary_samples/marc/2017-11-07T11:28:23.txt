Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
