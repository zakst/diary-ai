Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
