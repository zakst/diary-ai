Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
