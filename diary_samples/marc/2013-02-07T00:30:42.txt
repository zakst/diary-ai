Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
