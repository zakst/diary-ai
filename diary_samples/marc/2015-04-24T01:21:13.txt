Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
