Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
