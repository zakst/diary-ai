Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
