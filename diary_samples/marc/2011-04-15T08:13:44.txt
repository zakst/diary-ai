Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
