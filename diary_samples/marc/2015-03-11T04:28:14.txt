Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
