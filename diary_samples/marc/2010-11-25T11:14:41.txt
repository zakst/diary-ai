Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
