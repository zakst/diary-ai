Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
