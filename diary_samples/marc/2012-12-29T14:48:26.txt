Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
