Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
