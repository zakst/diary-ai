Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
