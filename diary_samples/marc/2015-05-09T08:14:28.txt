Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
