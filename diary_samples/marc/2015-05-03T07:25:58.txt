Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
