Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
