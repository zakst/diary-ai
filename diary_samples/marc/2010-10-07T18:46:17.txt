Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
