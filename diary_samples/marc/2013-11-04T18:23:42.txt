Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
