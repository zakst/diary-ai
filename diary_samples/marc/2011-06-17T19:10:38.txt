Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
