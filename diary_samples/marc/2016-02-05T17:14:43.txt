Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
