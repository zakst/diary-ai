Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
