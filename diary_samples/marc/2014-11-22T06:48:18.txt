Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
