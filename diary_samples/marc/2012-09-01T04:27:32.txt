Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
