Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened.
