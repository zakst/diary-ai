Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
