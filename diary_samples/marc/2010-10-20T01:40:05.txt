Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
