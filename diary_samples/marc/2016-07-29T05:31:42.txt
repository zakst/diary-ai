Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
