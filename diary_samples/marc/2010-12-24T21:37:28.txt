Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
