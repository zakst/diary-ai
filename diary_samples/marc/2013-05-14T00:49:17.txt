Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
