Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
