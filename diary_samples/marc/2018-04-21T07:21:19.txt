Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
