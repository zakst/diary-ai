Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
