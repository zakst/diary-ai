Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
