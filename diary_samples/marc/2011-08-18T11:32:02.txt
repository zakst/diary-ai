Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
