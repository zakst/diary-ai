Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
