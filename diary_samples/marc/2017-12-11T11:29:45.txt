Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
