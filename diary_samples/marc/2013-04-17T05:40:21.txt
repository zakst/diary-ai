Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
