Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
