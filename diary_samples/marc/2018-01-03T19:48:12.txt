Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
