Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
