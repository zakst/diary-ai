Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
