Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
