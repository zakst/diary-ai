Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
