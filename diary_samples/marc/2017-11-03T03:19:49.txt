Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
