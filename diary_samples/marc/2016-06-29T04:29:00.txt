Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
