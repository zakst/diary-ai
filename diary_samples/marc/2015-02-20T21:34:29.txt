Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
