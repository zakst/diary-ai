Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
