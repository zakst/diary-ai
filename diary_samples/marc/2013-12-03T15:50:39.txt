Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
