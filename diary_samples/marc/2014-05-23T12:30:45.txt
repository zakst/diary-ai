Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
