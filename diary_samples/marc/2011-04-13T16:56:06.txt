Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
