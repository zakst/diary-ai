Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
