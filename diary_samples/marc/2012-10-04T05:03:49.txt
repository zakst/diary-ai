Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish.
