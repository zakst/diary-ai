Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
