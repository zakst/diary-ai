Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
