Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
