Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
