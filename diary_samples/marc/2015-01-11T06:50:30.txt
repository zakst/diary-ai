Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
