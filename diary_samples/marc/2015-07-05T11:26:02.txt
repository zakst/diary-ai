Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
