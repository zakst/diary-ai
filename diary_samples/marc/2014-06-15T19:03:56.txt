Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
