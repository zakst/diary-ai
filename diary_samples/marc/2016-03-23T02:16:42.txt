Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
