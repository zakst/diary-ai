Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Change used to scare me.

Boundaries matter more than I thought. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
