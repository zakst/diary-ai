Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
