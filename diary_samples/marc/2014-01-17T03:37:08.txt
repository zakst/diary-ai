Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
