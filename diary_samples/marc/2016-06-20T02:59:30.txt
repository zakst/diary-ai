Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
