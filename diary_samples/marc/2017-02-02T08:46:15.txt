Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
