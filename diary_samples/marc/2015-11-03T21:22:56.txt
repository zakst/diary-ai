Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
