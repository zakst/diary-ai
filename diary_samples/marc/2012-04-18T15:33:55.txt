Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
