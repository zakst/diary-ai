Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
