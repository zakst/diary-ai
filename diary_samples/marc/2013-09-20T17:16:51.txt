Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
