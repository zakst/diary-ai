Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection.
