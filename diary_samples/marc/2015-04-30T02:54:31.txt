Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
