Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
