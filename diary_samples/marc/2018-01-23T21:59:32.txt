Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
