Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
