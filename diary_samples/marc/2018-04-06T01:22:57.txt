Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
