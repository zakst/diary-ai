Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
