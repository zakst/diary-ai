Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper.
