Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
