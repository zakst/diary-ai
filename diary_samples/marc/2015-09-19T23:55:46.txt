Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
