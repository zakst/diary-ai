Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game!
