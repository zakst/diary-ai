Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
