Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
