Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it.
