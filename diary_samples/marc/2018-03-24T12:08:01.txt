Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
