Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
