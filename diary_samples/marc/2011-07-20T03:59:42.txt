Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
