Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
