Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
