Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
