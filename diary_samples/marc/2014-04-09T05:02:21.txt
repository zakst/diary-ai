Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that.
