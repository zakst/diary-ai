Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
