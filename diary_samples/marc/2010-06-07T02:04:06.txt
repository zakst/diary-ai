Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
