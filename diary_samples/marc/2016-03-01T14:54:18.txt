Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
