Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
