Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
