Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
