Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
