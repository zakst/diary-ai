Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
