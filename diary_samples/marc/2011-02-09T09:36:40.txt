Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
