Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.
