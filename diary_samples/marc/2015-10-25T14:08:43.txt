Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking.
