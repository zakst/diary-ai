Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
