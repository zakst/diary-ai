Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
