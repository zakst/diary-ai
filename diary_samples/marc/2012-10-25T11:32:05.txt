Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
