Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
