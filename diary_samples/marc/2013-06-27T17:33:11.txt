Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
