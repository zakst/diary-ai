Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
