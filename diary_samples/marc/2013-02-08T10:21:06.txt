Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time.
