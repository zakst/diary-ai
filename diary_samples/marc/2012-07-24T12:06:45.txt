Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
