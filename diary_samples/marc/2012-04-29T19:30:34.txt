Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
