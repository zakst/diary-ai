Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it.
