Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it.
