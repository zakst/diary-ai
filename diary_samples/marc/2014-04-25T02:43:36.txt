Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory.
