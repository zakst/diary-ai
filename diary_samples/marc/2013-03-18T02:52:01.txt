Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
