Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness.
