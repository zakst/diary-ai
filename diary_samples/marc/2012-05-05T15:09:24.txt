Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
