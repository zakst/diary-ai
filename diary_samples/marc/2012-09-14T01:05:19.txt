Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
