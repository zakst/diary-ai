Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought.
