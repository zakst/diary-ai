Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
