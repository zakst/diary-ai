Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
