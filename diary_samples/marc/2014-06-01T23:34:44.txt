Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths.
