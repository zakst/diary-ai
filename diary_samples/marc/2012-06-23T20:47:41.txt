Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us.
