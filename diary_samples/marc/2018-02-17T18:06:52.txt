Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
