Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
