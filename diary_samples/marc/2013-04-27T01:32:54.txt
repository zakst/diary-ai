Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
