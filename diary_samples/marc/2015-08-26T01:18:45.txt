Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing.
