Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again.
