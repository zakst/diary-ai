Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
