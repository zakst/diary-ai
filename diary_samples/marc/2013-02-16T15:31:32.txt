Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
