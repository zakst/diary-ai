Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
