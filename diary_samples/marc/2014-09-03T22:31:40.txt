Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work.
