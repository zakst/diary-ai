Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
