Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
