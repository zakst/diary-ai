Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing.
