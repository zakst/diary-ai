Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago.
