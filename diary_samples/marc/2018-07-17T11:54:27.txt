Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
