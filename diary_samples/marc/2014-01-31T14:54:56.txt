Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right.
