Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
