Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
