Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. We kissed under the arches by the old bridge. I’ll never forget that feeling of timelessness. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
