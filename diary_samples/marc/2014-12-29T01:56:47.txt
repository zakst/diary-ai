Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
