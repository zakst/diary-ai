Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming.
