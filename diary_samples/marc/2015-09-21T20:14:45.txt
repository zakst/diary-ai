Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
