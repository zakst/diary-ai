Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela.
