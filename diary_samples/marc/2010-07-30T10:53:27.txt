Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist.
