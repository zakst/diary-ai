Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc.
