Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Dark energy still feels like science fiction, but all the data says it’s real. That mystery pulls me in deeper. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know.
