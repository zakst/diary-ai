Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old.
