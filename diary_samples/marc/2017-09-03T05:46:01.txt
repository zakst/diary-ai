Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything.
