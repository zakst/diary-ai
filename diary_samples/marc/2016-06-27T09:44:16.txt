Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful?
