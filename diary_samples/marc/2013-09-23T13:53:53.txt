Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.'
