Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting.
