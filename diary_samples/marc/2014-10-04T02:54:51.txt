Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. Sometimes I look in the mirror and wonder if 15-year-old me would recognize this version of Marc. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days.
