Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there.
