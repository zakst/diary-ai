Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
