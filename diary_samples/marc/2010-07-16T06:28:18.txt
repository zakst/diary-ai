Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions.
