Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
