Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space.
