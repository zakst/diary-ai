Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Plaza de la Virgen was buzzing tonight. Tourists, laughter, music—it never gets old. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe.
