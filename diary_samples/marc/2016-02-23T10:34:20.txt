Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Quantum fluctuations and inflation—what a bizarre combo that led to everything we see today.
