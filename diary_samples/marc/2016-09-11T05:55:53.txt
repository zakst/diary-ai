Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. She brought me coffee while I was working. I didn’t ask—she just knew I needed it. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come.
