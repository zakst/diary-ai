Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Got feedback on my paper draft—constructive but tough. I needed that. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Growing up feels like being stretched across two worlds—who I was and who I’m becoming. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams.
