Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. She texted me first today and my heart raced like I was 15 again. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Sometimes the equations don’t balance, the code won’t run—but I’m still in love with the work. Life isn’t linear. It’s more like a spiral—I keep circling back to old lessons at new depths. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Walking by the Turia River today, I felt a rush of nostalgia from my school days. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I can’t stop thinking about black holes. How can something so destructive be so beautiful? I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups.
