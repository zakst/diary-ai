Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! Mistakes don’t feel like failures anymore. They’re just part of the shape I’m taking. The expansion of the universe still baffles me. It’s like space itself is breathing. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. The smell of fresh bread from the panadería reminded me of mornings with my abuela. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow.
