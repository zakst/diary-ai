Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Presented my findings at a small conference. Nervous, but I nailed it. Being in love makes everything else—research, stress, the future—seem lighter somehow. The beach felt different today. Maybe it’s me who’s changed, not the waves. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Paella on Sundays is more than tradition; it’s how my family says 'I love you.' We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. I rode my bike past the old university building and remembered sneaking snacks into study groups. Balancing equations and deadlines is a dance I’m learning, one misstep at a time. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush.
