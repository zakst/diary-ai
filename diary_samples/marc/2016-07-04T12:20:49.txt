Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The colors in Valencia after rain—soft oranges, golds, and grays—make everything feel like a painting. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I finally opened up to my parents about wanting to study cosmology. They didn’t fully get it, but they listened. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. I had to let go of a few friends this year. We just grew in different directions. She understands the silence between words. I never thought I’d find that kind of connection. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life.
