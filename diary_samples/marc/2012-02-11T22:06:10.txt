Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. The mathematics behind orbital mechanics is tough, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it. Today I studied the large-scale structure of the universe, and I’m amazed at how galaxies form web-like patterns across space. We spent the afternoon just lying under the stars and talking. No distractions, just us. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. I love how she listens, really listens. It’s like being seen for the first time. My advisor challenged my assumptions today. It stung, but he’s right. Building models of galaxy formation makes me realize how much we still don’t know. Lab work until midnight, but we finally got the results we needed.
