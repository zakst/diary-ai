Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. Change used to scare me. Now, I almost look forward to it. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Learning to say no has been a big lesson this year. Boundaries matter more than I thought. There’s something magical about Valencia’s twilight. It wraps the city in a soft hush. Started mentoring a first-year student. Wild to think I was there not long ago. No matter how far I travel, I always come back to Valencia in my dreams. The older I get, the more I realize how much I don’t know—and that’s oddly freeing. Every time I run simulations about the early universe, I feel like I’m peeking into the past.
