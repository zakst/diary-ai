Marc here. Just getting these thoughts down before the day ends. Her hand fits perfectly in mine, like it’s always been meant to be there. Reading about the multiverse made me wonder if another 'Marc' is out there, living a parallel version of my life. I still get excited about Fallas. The fire, the noise, the community—it’s chaos I cherish. I caught her looking at me when I was laughing. That moment is now burned into my memory. Imposter syndrome hit hard today, but then I remembered how far I’ve come. Published my first journal article today. Marc is officially in the game! My mentor explained cosmic microwave background radiation today—it's like a baby picture of the universe. Marc isn’t just a student anymore. I’m starting to feel like a scientist. I miss the simplicity of childhood sometimes, but I wouldn’t trade what I’ve learned for anything. We argued today, but even in that, there’s a kind of closeness I never expected.
