Today I spent some time music and art. It made me think about how much I enjoy these small moments. Life in Berlin always has something new around the corner. After work at the climbing gym, I took a long walk and treated myself to a strong coffee. I've been thinking a lot about my next YouTube videoâ€”maybe something personal this time. Also, there's this girl I keep running into at the market. She has the most beautiful smile... I wonder if she feels the same spark I do. Berlin has a way of keeping your heart on its toes.
