Aug. 26, Monsieur went back agayn to France. Sept. 10th, my dream of
being naked, and my skyn all overwrowght with work like some kinde
of tuft mockado, with crosses blew and red; and on my left arme,
abowt the arme, in a wreath, this word I red-- sine me nihil
potestis facere: and another the same night of Mr. Secretary
Walsingham, Mr. Candish, and myself.
