  [Footnote n: Dee has occasionally made use of Greek letters
  for the preservation of his notes, still retaining the English
  language. The present passage may as well be given:-- “This
  night my wife dreamed that one cam to her and touched her,
  saying, ‘Mistres Dee, you are conceived of child, whose name
  must be Zacharias; be of good chere, he sal do well as this
  doth!’”]

  See Transliteration Key at end of text.]

  [Footnote o: In a more appropriate place I shall give from an
  Ashmolean manuscript a traditionary anecdote relating to this
  Roger Coke, or Cooke, and the great secret which Dee revealed to
  him.]
