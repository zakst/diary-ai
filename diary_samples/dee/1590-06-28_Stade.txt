June 28th, I payd Mr. Hudson for all his corn, and also for the wood
tyll May, receyved synce I cam home.

  [Footnote ff: There are a great many brief notices in this
  diary relative to Jane Dee, most of which are expressed in
  astrological symbols; and as they are exceedingly difficult to
  decipher satisfactorily, and are certainly of very little, if
  any importance, I have thought it expedient to omit them. The
  entry of “Ιανε ἁδ θεμ” is also of frequent occurrence, though
  what “θεμ” can refer to I have not been able to discover.]

    [Transcriber’s Note:
    See diary entries for June 17th, 1587, and February 28th, 1588.]

  [Footnote gg: Dee has preserved several interesting notices
  of his intimacies with the principal navigators of his time.
  A general reference to Hackluyt will be sufficient.]
