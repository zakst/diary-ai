March 1st, Mr. Clerkson browght Magnus to me at Mortlak, and so went
that day agayn. March 6th, Barnabas Saul cam this day agayn abowt
one of the clok and went to London the same afternone. He confessed
that he neyther hard or saw any spirituall creature any more. March
8th, Mr. Clerkson and his frende cam to my howse. Barnabas went home
agayn abowt 3 or 2 clok, he lay not at my howse now; he went, I say,
on Thursday, with Mr. Clerkson. March 8th, cœlum ardere et instar
sanguinis in diversis partibus rubere visum est circa horam nonam
noctis, maxime versus septentrionalem et occidentalem partem:
sed ultra capita nostra versus austrum frequenter miles quasi
sanguineus. March 9th, Fryday at dynner tyme Mr. Clerkson and Mr.
Talbot[v] declared a great deale of Barnabas nowghty dealing toward
me, as in telling Mr. Clerkson ill things of me that I should mak
his frend, as that he was wery of me, that I wold so flatter his
frende the lerned man that I wold borow him of him. But his frend
told me, before my wife and Mr. Clerkson, that a spirituall creature
told him that Barnabas had censured both Mr. Clerkson and me. The
injuries which this Barnabas had done me diverse wayes were very
great. March 22nd, Mr. Talbot went to London, to take his jornay.

  [Footnote v: Just above this relation some one has written,
  “you that rede this underwritten assure yourselfe that yt is
  a shamfull lye, for Talbot neither studied for any such thinge
  nor shewed himselfe dishonest in any thinge.” Dr. Dee has thus
  commented upon it:-- “This is Mr. Talbot or that lerned man, his
  own writing in my boke, very unduely as he cam by it.” There are
  several other notices of Talbot erased, but whether by him or
  by the Doctor it is impossible to say, but most probably the
  former.]
