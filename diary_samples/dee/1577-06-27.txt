  [Footnote d: “Dr. Dee dwelt in a house neere the water side,
  a little westward from the church [at Mortlake]. The buildings
  which Sir Fr. Crane erected for working of tapestry hangings, and
  are still (1673) employed to that use, were built upon the
  ground whereon Dr. Dee’s laboratory and other roomes for that
  use stood. Upon the west is a square court, and the next is the
  house wherein Dr. Dee dwelt, now inhabited by one Mr. Selbury,
  and further west his garden.” --MS. Ashm. 1788, fol. 149. The
  same account says that “Dr. Dee was wel beloved and respected of
  all persons of quality thereabouts, who very often invited him
  to their houses or came to his.”]

  [Footnote e: This of course is his celebrated Monas
  Hieroglyphica, frequently printed, and the nature of which
  I attempted to explain in a paper read before the Society of
  Antiquaries. Mr. Herbert, according to MS. Ashm. 1788, “dwelt
  then in Mortlack and was an intimate friend of Dr. Dee’s.”]

  [Footnote f: This was his work printed in 1577 under the title
  of General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the perfect Art of
  Navigation, in folio, now a book of the greatest rarity. The
  original manuscript of it is in MS. Ashm. 1789, and Dee’s own
  copy of the published work with MS. notes and additions is
  preserved in the British Museum. In his Letter Apologetical,
  4to. Lond. 1603, he cites this work under the title of The
  Brytish Monarchie, as having been written in the year 1576.]
