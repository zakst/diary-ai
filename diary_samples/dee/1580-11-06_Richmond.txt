  before buried out of the house, her Majestie refused to come in;
  but willed to fetch my glass so famous, and to show unto her
  some of the properties of it, which I did; her Majestie being

  the Horse, at the church wall of Mortlake, did see some of the
  properties of that glass, to her Majestie’s great contentment
  and delight.” --_Compendious Memorial_, p. 516. This glass is
