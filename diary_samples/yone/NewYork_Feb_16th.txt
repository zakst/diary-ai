16th—Amerikey is away beyond.

Not even a speck of San Francisco in sight yet!

I amused myself thinking what would happen if I never returned home.

Marriage with a ’Merican, wealthy and comely?

I had well-nigh decided that I would not cross such an ocean again by
ship. I would wait patiently until a trans-Pacific railroad is erected.

I was basking in the sun.

I fancied the “Belgic” navigating a wrong track.

What then?

Was I approaching lantern-eyed demons or howling cannibals?

“Iya, iya, no! I will proudly land on the historical island of Lotos
Eaters.” I said.

Why didn’t I take Homer with me? The ocean is just the place for his
majestic simplicity and lofty swing.

I recalled a few passages of “The Lotos Eaters” by Lord Tennyson—it
sounds better than “the poet Tennyson.” I love titles, but they are
thought as common as millionaires nowadays.

A Jap poet has a different mode of speech.

Shall I pose as poet?

’Tis no great crime to do so.

I began my “Lotos Eaters” with the following mighty lines:


              “O dreamy land of stealing shadows!
               O peace-breathing land of calm afternoon!
               O languid land of smile and lullaby!
               O land of fragrant bliss and flower!
               O eternal land of whispering Lotos Eaters!”


Then I feared that some impertinent poet might have said the same thing
many a year before.

Poem manufacture is a slow job.

Modern people slight it, calling it an old fashion. Shall I give it up
for some more brilliant up-to-date pose?
