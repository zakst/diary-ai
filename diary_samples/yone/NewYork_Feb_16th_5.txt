16th—It seems to me a recent style that New York ladies discard their
babies to leave them in the hands of European immigrants (very likely
they want them to learn an ungrammatical hodge-podge, as respectableness
is old-fashioned) and accompany a dog with mighty affection.

O my dear “chin” that I left at home!

Shall I call it to Amerikey?

Little loyal thing, pathetic, clinging!

I am sure it would beat any other in a dog contest.
