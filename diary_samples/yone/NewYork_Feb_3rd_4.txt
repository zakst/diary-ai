3rd—I searched for a pen and ink in my Willow Cottage.

Nothing like those.

Foxy Poet!

He hid them from view, I fancied, in the opinion that playing with them
for a girl is more jeopardous than swallowing needles.

I say that letter-writing—particularly a decent love letter, if there is
one—isn’t half so grave a crime as rhyming.

I was spraying some water on a rose by the gate, when I caught sight of
a white quill by my shoes.

“This will serve me perfectly,” I said.

I had not one thing with any tooth except my comb. (Comb? Luckily I have
not lost it Ara, ma, my hairpins! Five of them vanished from my head
while I was springing amid the rocks. By and by the stems of acacia
leaves shall be used in their places. Don’t you know this is quite a
remote spot from civilisation?) A kitchen knife shaped my quill as a
pen.

Now only ink!

I begged Uncle to run down three miles to fetch one bottle.
