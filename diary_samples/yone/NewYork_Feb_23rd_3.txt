23rd—A letter from my father arrived.

“O Papa, please don’t! I am tired of such a dirty conference.” I
scoffed.

I tore the paper into shreds.

“What a sullen lady! What did Otto San write? Marriage proposal, I
reckon!” my uncle intruded.

“Papa threatened me with a list of suitors. He cried, ‘Chance, chance!’
like the gate-man of an ennichi show. Pray grant me for once in my life,
Uncle, to say: ‘The marriage lottery go to the dogs!’ How many Jap girls
kill themselves from the burden of such a glued union, do you suppose?”

“Then, ‘free marriage’?”

“Of course!”

“It’s very beautiful, Miss Morning Glory.”

“Why not?”

“You are Japanese, aren’t you?”

“Did you ever think I was a Meriken jin?”

“Well, then, how did you come to know young men in a country where
familiarity with one is regarded as a crime for a girl?”

“Things all wrong in Nippon, Uncle!”

“I am sorry you were born a Jap.”

“I’ll never go back to Japan, I think. The dictionary for Jap girls
comprises no such word as ‘No.’ But you must remember, Uncle, I have the
capital ‘No’ in my head. I am a revolutionist,” I proclaimed.

Then I thought much of my dear Oscar.
