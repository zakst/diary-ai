18th—My uncle asked if my great work of poetical inspiration was
completed.

“Uncle, I haven’t written a dozen lines yet. My ‘Lotos Eaters’ is to be
equal in length to ‘The Lady of the Lake.’ Now, see, Oji San, mine has
to be far superior to the laureate’s, not merely in quality, but in
quantity as well. But I thought it was not the way of a sweet Japanese
girl to plunder a garland from the old poet by writing in rivalry. Such
a nice man Tennyson was!” I said.

I smiled and gazed on him slyly.

“So! You are very kind!” he jerked.
