24th—My uncle didn’t come back yesterday. Mr. Poet condescended to the
town.

I am alone.

I spent the entire forenoon with Grandma, peeling potatoes, strewing
sweet pea seeds on the ground.

I ascended the hill with the root of a white rose—believing in the
Nippon idea that blossoms for the dead should be white—and set it by the
grave.

Then I stole into the canyon.

I amassed the dead leaves of redwood by the brook for a camp-fire.

The smoke rose like a soul unto heaven.

I watched its beautiful confusion.

When I left, a snake obstructed my path, flashing its needle of a
tongue.

Snake, one of my greatest foes! (The others being cheese and
mathematics.)

I turned pale.

But I bravely faced it, hoping that it would speak a word or two, as one
did to Eve. I placed my eyes on it, though in fear. Perhaps it wasn’t as
intelligent as the one in the garden of Eden. Maybe it thought it
nothing but a waste of time to address a Jap poorly stored in English.
It crept away.

I ran down the hill.

A storm of laughter struck me from within when I came to my Willow
Cottage. I examined it from the window. Half a dozen young ladies were
biting pie. (Pie! Rustic pastry I ever so hate!)

“Picnic!” I murmured.

My blood gushed up. I was on the verge of denouncing their irruption.
The cottage belongs to any one, I said in my afterthought, as it does to
me.

I slipped away.

I found myself in the plum orchard with a hoe.

I began to root the weeds. I waited silently for their departure.
