24th—The song of gay children scattered over the street had subsided.
The harvest moon shone like a yellow halo of “Nono Sama.” All things in
blessed Mitsuho No Kuni—the smallest ant also—bathed in sweet inspiring
beams of beauty. The soft song that is not to be heard but to be felt,
was in the air.

’Twas a crime, I judged, to squander lazily such a gracious graceful
hour within doors.

I and my maid strolled to the Konpira shrine.

Her red stout fingers—like sweet potatoes—didn’t appear so bad tonight,
for the moon beautified every ugliness.

Our Emperor should proclaim forbidding woman to be out at any time
except under the moonlight.

Without beauty woman is nothing. Face is the whole soul. I prefer death
if I am not given a pair of dark velvety eyes.

What a shame even woman must grow old!

One stupid wrinkle on my face would be enough to stun me.

My pride is in my slim fingers of satin skin.

I’ll carefully clean my roseate finger-nails before I’ll land in
America.

Our wooden clogs sounded melodious, like a rhythmic prayer unto the sky.
Japs fit themselves to play music even with footgear. Every house with a
lantern at its entrance looked a shrine cherishing a thousand idols
within.

I kneeled to the Konpira god.

I didn’t exactly see how to address him, being ignorant what sort of god
he was.

I felt thirsty when I reached home. Before I pulled a bucket from the
well, I peeped down into it. The moonbeams were beautifully stealing
into the waters.

My tortoise-shell comb from my head dropped into the well.

The waters from far down smiled, heartily congratulating me on going to
Amerikey.
