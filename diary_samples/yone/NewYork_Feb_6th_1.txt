6th—We had a shower.

The city dipped in a bath.

The pedestrians threw their vaguely delicate shadows on the pavements.
The ladies voluntarily permitted the gentlemen to review their legs. If
I were in command, I would not permit the ladies to raise an umbrella
under the “para para” of a shower. Their hastening figures are so
fascinating.

The shower stopped. The pavements were glossed like a looking-glass. The
windows facing the sun scattered their sparkling laughter.

How beautiful!

I am perfectly delighted by this city.

One thing that disappoints me, however, is that Frisco is eternally
snowless,

Without snow the year is incomplete, like a departure without sayonara.

Dear snow! O Yuki San!

Many Winters ago I modelled a doll of snow, which was supposed to be a
gentleman.

How proud I used to be when I stamped the first mark with my high ashida
on the white ground before anyone else!

I wonder how Santa Claus will array himself to call on this town.

His fur coat is not appropriate at all.
