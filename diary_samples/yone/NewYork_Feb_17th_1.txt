17th—I went to the gallery of the photographer Taber, and posed in
Nippon “pera pera.”

The photographer spread before me many pictures of the actress in the
part of “Geisha.”

She was absurd.

I cannot comprehend where ’Mericans get the conception that Jap girls
are eternally smiling puppets.

Are we crazy to smile without motive?

What an untidy presence!

She didn’t even fasten the front of her kimono.

Charm doesn’t walk together with disorder under the same Japanese
parasol.

And I had the honour to be presented to an extraordinary mode in her
hair.

It might be entitled “ghost style.” It suggested an apparition in the
“Botan Toro” played by kikugoro.

The photographer handed me a fan.

Alas! It was a Chinese fan in a crude mixture of colour.

He urged me to carry it.

I declined, saying:

“Nobody fans in cool November!”
