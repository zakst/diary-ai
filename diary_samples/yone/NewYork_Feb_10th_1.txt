10th—I promised Mrs. Schuyler, Jr., good care of her baby for half an
hour.

I carried it firm on my arms.

I jogged out to the garden.

The baby faced toward me and said:

“Bu, bu! Bu, bu, bu!”

I felt grateful, thinking that it counted me among its friends.

I laid its head on my breast.

I sang a little Japanese lullaby:


                           “Nenneko, nenneko,
                            Nennekoyo!
                            Oraga akanbowa
                            Itsudekita?
                            Sangatsu sakurano
                            Sakutokini!
                            Doride okawoga.
                            Sakurairo.”


(Sleep, sleep, sleep! When was our baby made? Third month, when the
cherry blossoms. So the honourable face of our child is cherry-blossom
coloured.)

The breezes billed and cooed upon the grasses. An imperial palm cast its
rich shadow.

The affectionate sunlight made me think of a “little Spring” of the
Japanese September. Everything inclined to a siesta in the yellow air.

A tropical touch is the touch of passion.

Can you fancy this is the month of December?

I cannot.

After I put the baby to its nurse, I paced around a bronze statue upon
the lawn, losing myself in Greek beauty.

Then I snatched a rose.

I pressed it to my nose-tip.
