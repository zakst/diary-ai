9th—To-day is the third anniversary of my grandmother’s death.

I will keep myself in devotion.

I burned the incense I had bought from a Chinaman. I watched the
beautiful gesticulation of its smoke.

Good Grandma!

She wished she could live long enough to be present at my wedding
ceremony. She prayed that she might select the marriage equipage for me.

I am alone yet.

I wonder if she knows—does her ghost peep from the grasses?—that I am
drifting among the ijins she ever loathed.

I don’t see how to manage myself sometimes—like an unskilful fictionist
with his heroine.

When shall I get married?
