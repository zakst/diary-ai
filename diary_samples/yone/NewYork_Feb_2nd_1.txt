2nd—If I could be a gentleman for just one day!

I would rest myself on the hospitable chair of a barber shop—barber
shop, drug store and candy store are three beauties on the street—like a
prince of leisure, and dream something great, while the man is busy with
a razor.

I am envious of the gentleman who may bathe in such a purple hour.

I never rest.

American ladies neither!

Each one of them looks worried as if she expected the door-bell any
moment.

I suppose it is the penalty of being a woman.
