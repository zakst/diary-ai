18th—We had a laugh.

Ada, my sweet singer of “My Gal’s a High-Born Lady,” accompanied me to a
matinée of one vaudeville.

This is the age of quick turn, sudden flashes.

The long show has ceased to be the fashion. Modern people are tired of
the slowness of old times which was once supposed to be seriousness.

Could anything be prouder than the face of the acrobat retiring after a
perilous performance?

Woman tumbler!

I wondered how Meriken ladies could enjoy looking at such a degeneration
of woman.

I was glad, however, that I did not see any snake-charmer.

What a delightful voice that negro had! Who could imagine that such a
silvery sound could come from such a midnight face? It was like clear
water out of the ground.

I was struck by a fancy.

I sprang up.

I attempted to imitate the high-kick dance.

I fell down abruptly.

“Jap’s short leg is no use in Amerikey—can’t achieve one thing. I am
frankly tired of mine,” I grumbled.
