10th—I yawned.

Nothing is more unbecoming to a woman than yawning.

I think it no offence to swear once in a while in one’s closet.

I was alone.

I tore to pieces my “Things Seen in the Street,” and fed the waste-paper
basket with them.

The basket looked so hungry without any rubbish. An unkept basket is
more pleasing, like a soiled autograph-book.

“I didn’t come to Amerikey to be critical, that is, to act mean, did I?”
I said.

I must remain an Oriental girl, like a cherry blossom smiling softly in
the Spring moonlight.

But afterwards I felt sorry for my destruction.

I thrust my hand into the basket. I plucked them up. They were illegibly
as follows:


              “       women coursing like a
              ’rikisha of ’Hama       their children

              while walking. If you once show such a grace
              at Tokio, you shall wait fruitlessly for the
              marriage offer.

              “San Francisco is a beautiful city, but

And I missed some other hundred lines.
