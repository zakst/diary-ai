3rd—My hand has seldom lifted anything weightier than a comb to adjust
my hair flowing down my neck.

The “silver” knife (large and sharp enough to fight the Russians)
dropped and cracked a bit of the rim of the big plate.

My hand tired.

My uncle and I were seated at a round table in a celebrated American
restaurant, the “Western Sea House.”

It was my first occasion to face an orderly heavy Meriken table d’hote.

Its fertile taste was oily, the oppressive smell emetic.

Must I make friends with it?

I am afraid my small stomach is only fitted for a bowl of rice and a few
cuts of raw fish.

There is nothing more light, more inviting, than Japanese fare. It is
like a sweet Summer villa with many a sliding shoji from which you smile
into the breeze and sing to the stars.

Lightness is my choice.

When, I wondered, could I feel at home with American food!

My uncle is a Meriken “toow.” He promised to show me a heap of things in
America.

He is an 1884 Yale graduate. He occupies the marked seat of the chief
secretary of the “Nippon Mining Company.” He has procured leave for one
year.

                  *       *       *       *       *

What were the questionable-looking fragments on the plate?

Pieces with pock-marks!

Cheese was their honourable name.

My uncle scared me by saying that some “charming” worms resided in them.

Pooh, pooh!

They emitted an annoying smell. You have to empty the choicest box of
tooth powder after even the slightest intercourse with them.

I dare not make their acquaintance—no, not for a thousand yens.

I took a few of them in my pocket papers merely as a curiosity.

Shall I hang them on the door, so that the pest may not come near to our
house?

(Even the pest-devils stay away from it, you see.)
