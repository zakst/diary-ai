15th—Night has just arrived.

Only ten minutes ago a white-capped “Jim” (I overheard people calling
him so) lighted a paper lantern labelled “Tomales.” He is an
eating-stand keeper across the street. The loafers passed. There was
some time to watch the lazy parade. It was a blank hour of Saturday when
he could puff a whiff of smoke.

The prankish songs ceased.

Even in Dupont Street I am given a page of dream.

The barkeeper of “Remember the Maine” called at my store.

“Remember the Maine?”

It is a name cheap as the grimness of a toothless woman.

Mr. Barkeeper had something to say, I imagined.

I offered a stem of cigarette.

“Do you ever hear a bloody cry at night?” he began his chapter,
gathering a medley of gravity on his brow.

“Scream? No!”

“Never mind!”

He turned aside. I thought he was playing a threadbare artifice of a
story-teller to tantalise my fancy.

“Tell me why!”

I knew I became his victim.

“I fear I do scare you.”

“No! I never——” I leaned forward.

“To begin with——”

He stopped, looking around.

“Your kitchen—don’t be scared—is close by a haunted room of a house on
Pine Street. It’s no story. A chorus girl lived—well, some five years
ago—in that house with her step-mother. Just think! The old hen of
sixty-five fell in love with her daughter’s lover. Do you understand?
She saw one morning the young fellow kissing her daughter. She went
crazy. She shot him. Isn’t it awful? The murderess leaned against the
wall by your kitchen, and cried, ‘I killed him!’ I swear to you that it
is all true. So, people say, a wail is heard at night from your side.”

“Mah! Mah!” I breathed.

“That is all.”

He retired heavily.

Do I believe it?

“No! No!” I denied.

But I was thickly swarmed by sickening air. How could I trust me in the
kitchen!

I closed the store.

I pasted up a piece of paper whereon was written: “NO BUSINESS
TO-NIGHT.”
