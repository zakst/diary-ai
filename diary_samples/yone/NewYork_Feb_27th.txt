27th—I scissored out the pictures from the ’Merican magazines.

(The magazines were all tired-looking back numbers. New ones are
serviceable in their own home. Forgotten old actors stray into the
villages for an inglorious tour. So it is with the magazines. Only the
useless numbers come to Japan, I presume.)

The pictures—Meriken is a country of woman; that’s why, I fancy, the
pictures are chiefly of woman—showed me how to pick up the long skirt.
That one act is the whole “business” of looking charming on the street.
I apprehend that the grace of American ladies is in the serpentine
curves of the figure, in the narrow waist.

Woman is the slave of beauty.

I applied my new corset to my body. I pulled it so hard.

It pained me.
