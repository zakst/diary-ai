22nd—I need repose. The last few weeks have stirred me dreadfully. I
will slumber just comfortably day after day, I decided.

But the same feeling as on the ocean returned.

My American bed acted like water, waving at even my slightest motion.

I fancied I was exercising even in sleep.

It is too soft.

Nothing can put me at complete ease like my hereditary lying on the
floor.

I was restless all the night long.

I got up, since the bed was no joy.

Oh, the blue sky!

I thought I should never again see a sapphire sky while I am here. I was
wrong.

This is church day.

The bells of the street-cars sounded musical.

The sky appeared in best Sunday dress.

I felt happy thinking that I should see the stars from my hotel window
to-night.

                  *       *       *       *       *

I made many useless trips up and down the elevator for fun.

What a tickling dizziness I tasted!

I close my eyes when it goes.

It’s an awfully new thing, I reckon.

Something on the same plan, I imagine, as a “seriage” of the Japanese
stage for a footless ghost rising to vanish.

It is astonishing to notice what a condescending manner the white
gentlemen display toward ladies.

They take off their hats in the elevator—some showing such a great bald
head, like a funny O Binzuru, that is as common as spectacled
children—if any woman is present. They stand humbly as Japs to the
august “Son of Heaven.” They crawl out like lambs after the woman steps
away.

It puzzles me to solve how women can be deserving of such honour.

What a goody-goody act!

But I wonder how they behave themselves before God!
