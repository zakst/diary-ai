11th—A letter from the minister arrived.

(I’d be a postman, by the way, if I were a man. A noble work that is to
deliver around the love and “gokigen ukagai.”)

I clipped off the Mexican stamp.

I will make a stamp book for my boy who may be born when I become a
wife.

Before opening the letter I pressed it to my ear. My imaginative ear
heard his illustrious “Ha, ha, ha——” rolling out.

How I missed his happy laughter!

Can he now pronounce a “How do?” in Mexican?
