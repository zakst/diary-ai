Morning, 21st—Three P.M. of to-day!

At last!

Beautiful Miss Morning Glory shall land on her dream-land, Amerikey.

That’s my humble name, sir.

18 years old.

(Why does the ’Merican lady regard it as an insult to be asked her own
age?)

My knitting work wasn’t half done. I look upon it as an omen that I
shall have no luck in meeting with my husband.

Tsumaranai! What a barren life!

                  *       *       *       *       *

Our great minister was placing a button on his shirt. His trembling
fingers were uncertain.

I snatched the shirt from his hand and exhibited my craft with the
needle.

“I fancied that you modern girls were perfect strangers to the needle,”
he said.

He is not blockish, I thought, since he permits himself to employ irony.

My uncle was lamenting that he had not even one cigar left.

Both those gentlemen offered to help me in my dressing at the landing.

I declined gracefully.

Where is my looking-glass?

I must present myself very—very pretty.
