25th—A bamboo table in my room reminded me of a take bush in the
neighbouring churchyard of my Tokio home.

(I cannot sound Meriken jin’s curiosity in prizing such a cheap thing.
The bamboo was painted. The cross nails glared from everywhere. I never
saw such a Jap work in Nippon.)

Dear take, O bamboo bush!

How I used to laugh, breaking the dreams of sparrows by wriggling the
bush!

I was so ungoverned.

If I could be a grammar school girl again!

I secured a reader at a bookstall. My mind was made up to present myself
in the Lincoln night school and mingle with the girls in “SEE THE BOY
AND THE DOG!”

What fun!

I went to see the stooping principal. His tarnished frock-coat—I fancied
he was an old bachelor, as one button was off—was just the thing for
such a _rôle_.

I seemed to him a regular nenne of thirteen.

He was heartily pleased with my greediness for learning English.

Poor soul!

He ushered me into the class for which I had brought the book.

It was the hour for composition. “Ocean,” the subject.

When I was seated, the girl next me winked charmingly. She threw me a
note within a minute, to which I promptly replied, “Morning Glory.” My
note was answered “Miss Madge, 340 Mission Street.” I wrote her, “May I
call on you to-morrow?” for which she wrote, “As you please.”

I was placed on the dangerous verge of clapping Byron’s poem into my
“Ocean.” I manufactured one dozen of spelling errors.

“You should belong to some higher class. Take this slip to the
principal!” the teacher said. “You have an imagination.” She wiped her
spectacles slowly.

I left the room remarking, “Because I am a Japanese.”

I slipped away from the school altogether.

“One experience is plenty,” I declared.
