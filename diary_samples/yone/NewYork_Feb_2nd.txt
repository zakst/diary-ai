2nd—Occasional forgetfulness, I venture to say, is one of woman’s
charms.

But I fear too many lapses in my case fill the background.

I amuse myself sometimes fancying whether I shall forget my husband’s
name (if I ever have one).

How shall I manage “shall” and “will”? My memory of it is faded.

I searched for a printed slip, “How to use Shall and Will.” I pressed to
explore even the pantry after it.

Afterward I recalled that Professor asserted that Americans were not
precise in grammar. The affirmation of any professor isn’t weighty
enough. But my restlessness was cured somehow.

                  *       *       *       *       *

“This must be the age of Jap girls!” I ejaculated.

I was reading a paper on our bamboo land, penned by Mr. Somebody.

The style was inferior to Irving’s.

I have read his gratifying “Sketch Book.” I used to sleep holding it
under my wooden pillow.

Woman feels happy to stretch her hand even in dream, and touch something
that belongs to herself. “Sketch Book” was my child for many, many
months.

Mr. Somebody has lavished adoring words over my sisters.

Arigato! Thank heavens!

If he didn’t declare, however, that “no sensible musume will prefer a
foreign raiment to her kimono!”

He failed to make of me a completely happy nightingale.

Shall I meet the Americans in our flapping gown?

I imagined myself hitting off a tune of “Karan Coron” with clogs, in
circumspect steps, along Fifth Avenue of somewhere. The throng swarmed
around me. They tugged my silken sleeves, which almost swept the ground,
and inquired, “How much a yard?” Then they implored me to sing some
Japanese ditty.

I’ll not play any sensational rôle for any price.

Let me remain a homely lass, though I express no craft in Meriken dress.

Do I look shocking in a corset?

“In Pekin you have to speak Makey Hey Rah” is my belief.
