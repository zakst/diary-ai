19th—Miss Olive offered to show me how to play golf.

I went to her home at Pasadena.

Pasadena is a luxurious Winter resort of cheerful aspect.

Its water is blessed.

Even the street cars run like a well-bred gentleman. The dog never
growls around. It only wags its tail. No beggars.

America’s outdoor diversion demands a great deal of strength.

What an imbecile “anego!”

After fifteen minutes I found two bean-like blisters on each palm.

I gave up the game.

I bought a golf outfit, nevertheless, in a store on my way home. The
sight of a lady carrying it once stamped itself on my mind as so
charming.

What attire would be becoming to me?

I said that my waist should be of deep red wool. Skirt? It must also be
of wool, of course, with a large checkerboard pattern. Silk isn’t
gamesome, is it? And the hat should be a mouse-coloured felt, which must
be thrust carelessly by my big gold pin with a coral head.

I well-nigh decided to dye my hair red.

What will my uncle say?
