28th—My heart was a lark.

I sang, but not in a trembling voice like a lark, some slices of school
song.

I skipped around my garden.

Because it occurred to me finally that I’ll appear beautiful in my new
costume.

I smiled happily to the sunlight whose autumnal yellow flakes—how yellow
they were!—fell upon my arm stretched to pluck a chrysanthemum.

I admit that my arm is brown.

But it’s shapely.
