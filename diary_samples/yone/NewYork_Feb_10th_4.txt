10th—My uncle wanted me to join him in visiting a stockyard to see the
doomed pigs groaning, “Fu, fu, fu!”

I declined.

Uncle started off alone.

There was some time before I heard someone fisting on my door.

“A Japanese gentleman wishes to see your husband, madam,” a hotel
attendant addressed me.

“Good God! My husband?” I cried.

Satemo!

How could any porter be such an ignoramus as not to distinguish between
Mrs. and Miss!

Possibly he esteemed me “modern” enough to marry an old man for money’s
sake.

Oya, he was Mr. Consul of Chicago.

“Walk in, sir! Uchino hito will return within an hour or so.”

Then I explained about “my husband.”

We both laughed.

There is nothing more pleasing when in an alien country than a chit-chat
in our native “becha becha.”

Japanese speech!

Such a beautifully indefinite, poetically untidy language!

I love it.
