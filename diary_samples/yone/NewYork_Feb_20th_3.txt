20th—Already I could suck from the agile air the flavour of spring upon
the lawn.

I was roving by the rose-bushes along the street with scissors.

A gentleman passed by me. How sluggish his shoes sounded! He stopped,
waving his old-scented smile, and addressed me:

“Good morning, young lady!”

“Ohayo!”

“I perceive that you are Japanese.”

“Yes, sir!”

He stepped nearer to me. I took a peep at the Bible under his arm.

“Are you a Christian?” he lowered his tone.

“Don’t you read the Gospel?” his voice rose higher.

“Don’t you attend church?” his sound grew higher still.

“I love to be shocked. I couldn’t sustain myself against a bore. Church?
It’s too sleepy, don’t you know? I have remarked that God is with me
without any sort of prayer, if I trace the path of righteousness. A
minister is only a meddling grandmamma to my mind. If I ever build my
ideal city, two things shall not be tolerated. One is a lawyer’s office
and the other is a church. Church, sir! May I present you with one
rose?”

I raised me to place it in his coat.

“Here’s a letter for you, Morning Glory!”

I was rescued by my uncle. How angelic his voice rang!

“I’m sorry, I’m much occupied this very morning,” I said, bowing
slightly.

I pushed myself within the door.

Poor preacher!
