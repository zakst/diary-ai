5th—A “chin koro” barked after me.

The Japanese little doggie doesn’t know better. He has to encounter many
a strange thing.

The tap of my shoes was a thrill to him. The rustling of my silk
skirt—such a volatile sound—sounded an alarm to him.

I was hurrying along the road home from uncle’s in Meriken dress.

What a new delight I felt to catch the peeping tips of my shoes from
under my trailing koshi goromo.

I forced my skirt to wave, coveting a more satisfactory glance.

Did I look a suspicious character?

I was glad, it amused me to think the dog regarded me as a foreign girl.

Oh, how I wished to change me into a different style! Change is so
pleasing.

My imitation was clever. It succeeded.

When I entered my house my maid was dismayed and said:

“Bikkuri shita! You terrified me. I took you for an ijin from Meriken
country.”

“Ho, ho! O ho, ho, ho!”

I passed gracefully (like a princess making her triumphant exit in the
fifth act) into my chamber, leaving behind my happiest laughter and shut
myself up.

I confess that I earned the most delicious moment I have had for a long
time.

I cannot surrender under the accusation that Japs are _only_ imitators,
but I admit that we Nippon daughters are suited to be mimics.

Am I not gifted in the adroit art?

Where’s Mr. Somebody who made himself useful to warn the musumes?

Then I began to rehearse the scene of my first interview with a white
lady at San Francisco.

I opened Bartlett’s English Conversation Book, and examined it to see if
what I spoke was correct.

I sat on the writing table. Japanese houses set no chairs.

(Goodness, mottainai! I sat on the great book of Confucius.)

The mirror opposite me showed that I was a “little dear.”
