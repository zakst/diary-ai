11th—Now he is my beloved uncle.

He assured me of his help in carrying out my freak.

“You are fitting me for a slightly better rôle, I fancy,” he said,
venturing to add even one or two of his good-natured giggles. “The
secretaryship of a cigar-stand is a rather more hopeful occupation than
carrying your wraps through the street.”

Everything was arranged.

Mrs. Wistaria and her husband set off for San Jose.

I am a merchant-lady.

The first thing I did was to put up a dignified sign with the following
black letters:


                       MORNING GLORY CIGAR STORE.


I borrowed a picture from Mrs. Willis’ parlour, and placed it by the
slot machine.

It is the picture of a dear Injun sitting against a woodland fire with a
respectable pipe, whose smoke sails up to the yellow moon. What
resignation! What dream! What joy! It did suit beautifully for the
cigar-stand.

I love to see a man smoking. The elfish smoke acts like a merry-hearted
May gossamer. When I observe a man’s eye pursuing his smoke, I say to
myself that his soul must be stepping nearer to his ideal. The road of
smoke is the road of poesy.

A noble trade is tobacco.

Man’s hermitage is situated only in smoking, I should say.

I divested my uncle of his coat. I begged him to hold a bucket and a
piece of cloth for a moment.

“Are you ready to wash the windows, Uncle?” I said.

“Traitor, Morning Glory!” He flashed his accusing glare.

Docile old man!

He cleaned four windows of the kitchen, which was also the dining-room
and the parlour.

I paid him five cents for each.

I said: “It’s good fun to hire the chief secretary of the Nippon Mining
Company to rub windows, isn’t it?”

And I laughed.

Then I forced him to buy a cigar.

“You made some twenty cents out of me. Your turn is coming, my uncle!” I
said.

I sold him a box of Lillian Russell cigars for three dollars. The real
price was two.

Ha, ha, ha!
