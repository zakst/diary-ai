12th—It surprises me to learn that many an American is born and dies in
a hotel.

Such a life—however large rooms you may possess—is not distinguishable,
in my opinion, from that of a bird in a cage.

Is hotel-living a recent fashion?

Don’t say so!

The business locality—like the place where this Palace Hotel takes its
seat—does not afford a stomachful of respectable air.

I preferred some hospitable boarding house in a quiet street, where I
might even step up and down in nude feet. I wished to occupy a chamber
where the morning sun could steal in and shake my sleepy little head
with golden fingers as my beloved mama might do.

We will move to the “high-toned” boarding house of Mrs. Willis this
afternoon.

Her house is placed on the high hill of California Street.

I am grateful there is no car quaking along there.

My uncle says I shall have a whole lot of millionaires for neighbours.

California must be one dignified street.

The Chinese colony is close at hand from Mrs. Willis’,—the exotic
exposition brilliant with green and yellow colour. The incense surges.
So cute is the sparrow-eyed Asiatic girl—such a “karako”—with a small
cue on only one side of the head. Dear Oriental town!

Good luck, I pray, my Palace Hotel!

Sayonara, my graceful butlers!

I shall hear no more of their sweet “Yes, Madam!” They talk gently as a
lottery-seller.

The more they bow and smile the more you will press the button of tips.

They are so funny.

So long, everybody!
