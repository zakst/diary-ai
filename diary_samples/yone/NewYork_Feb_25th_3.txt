25th—I bought two dolls.

One for Schuyler’s baby, as my Christmas gift.

I slept with the other last night. I squeezed my ear to the dolly,
fancying I might hear a few scratches of human voice. I kissed it. I
laughed, saying that the doll was the thing for my starting to learn how
to kiss.

“Sleep till mamma comes back, darling!” I said in the morning when I
stepped down for my breakfast.

I left the table before I had half-finished, on account of my anxiety
lest the upstairs girl might tattle of my childishness, if she found the
doll in my bed.

Thank Heavens!

The girl hadn’t come around yet.

I locked it up in my trunk.

What name shall I give it?

Charley?

I was disgusted at the thought, because every Chinee—ten thousand
Mongols in all—is named one Charley.

Merry Christmas, all of you!
