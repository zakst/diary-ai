29th—I drank the last drop of my coffee.

“Oji San, when shall we go to New York?” I said, pillowing my face on my
hands on the breakfast table.

“As soon as spring begins to flicker in the East, my little woman! It’s
snow and snow there at present.”

“I love snow, Uncle.”

“Old gentleman can’t bear tyrannical cold, Morning Glory.”

“Don’t you notice how tired I am of Frisco? Aren’t you tired?”

“Yes—frankly!”

“Why don’t you then contrive some novel diversion to pass a month?”

“I’ve a fancy, but——”

“What is it?”

“It may not strike you as romantic.”

“Tell me!”

“I am known to one poet who dreams and erects a stone wall on the
hillside. He is unlike another. His garden and cottage are open to
everybody. I ever incline to loaf in an irregular puff of odour from his
acacia trees. If you lean towards a poetical life, I have no hesitation
in seeing him to make an arrangement.”

“Great Uncle, it’s romantic! Is he married?”

“Why?”

“Because a poet is not one woman’s property, but universal. My ideal
poet is melancholy. Fat poet is ridiculous. Happy poet isn’t of the
highest order. Tennyson? I wish his life had been more hard up. I
suppose your friend-poet won’t mind if I sleep all day. Is he particular
about the dinner time? Does he look up to the stars every night? Does he
wash his shirt once in a while?”

“Stop!”

Then I asked respectably:

“Is the sight from there beautiful?”

“Wonderful! The only place where you can breathe the air of divinity!”

“Very well, Uncle. We will settle there, and hasten to become poets.”

“It wouldn’t be a bad idea, I say, to start again with your honourable
‘Lotos Eaters!’”

“‘Paradise Lost’ shall be my next subject.”

“If nobody publishes it?”

“I will present it solemnly to our Empress. She is a poetess, you know.”

My uncle went to see Mr. Poet.
