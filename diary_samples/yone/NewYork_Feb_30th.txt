30th—Many a year I have prayed for something more decent than a marriage
offer.

I wonder if the generous destiny that will convey me to the illustrious
country of “woman first” isn’t the “something.”

I am pleased to sail for Amerikey, being a woman.

Shall I have to become “naturalized” in America?

The Jap “gentleman”—who desires the old barbarity—persists still in
fancying that girls are trading wares.

When he shall come to understand what is Love!

Fie on him!

I never felt more insulted than when I was asked in marriage by one
unknown to me.

No Oriental man is qualified for civilisation, I declare.

Educate man, but—beg your pardon—not the woman!

Modern gyurls born in the enlightened period of Meiji are endowed with
quite a remarkable soul.

I act as I choose. I haven’t to wait for my mamma’s approval to laugh
when I incline to.
