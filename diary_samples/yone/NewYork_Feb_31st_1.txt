31st—Street walking is a delight.

I’ll mirror my face in the glass of the shop windows ambling by.

I dropped a handkerchief to-day.

A gentle gentleman—man behind me should be young and good looking
always—picked it up. His respectful “Pardon me—” made me feel as if I
were living in the silver-armoured age of chivalry.

Shall I drop something again?

I observed a variety of form in raising the skirt.

One lifted a bit of the left by her finger-tips. Another pulled up the
right edge of her front. Another clinched out the centre of her back,
showing a significant fist. A corpulent one stepped, holding up both
sides of her front. The miserable underskirt revealed itself in red.

Which mode is becoming to me?
