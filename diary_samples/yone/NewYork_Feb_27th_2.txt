27th—I have been studying the catechism.

I am afraid to go to church, for the minister may put many a question to
me.

Is Miss Ada a dutiful church-goer?

I don’t think so.

She would rather mumble a nigger song than a chapter from the Bible.

I will ask her a few things from the catechism at my first opportunity.
