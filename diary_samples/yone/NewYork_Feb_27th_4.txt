27th—I bought one book, being captivated by its title. Isn’t “When
Knighthood was in Flower” beautifully chivalrous?

I have remarked that every Imperial cruiser anchors at an isle close by
Loo Choo, just on account of the enticement in the name “Come and See.”

I found in my trunk an introduction to Miss Rose by my professor friend
of Tokio ’versity.

Miss Rose?

My imagination started to move like a watch. I fancied she should be
nineteen, since she was a Miss. No Rose girl can be homely.

I went to see her.

Alas!

She was a lady like a beer-barrel. Her finger-nails were black.

I left her like a miner stepping out of a gold mountain with empty
hands.

I wonder why the mayor didn’t object to letting an ugly woman be crowned
with a pretty name.

Fifty-years-old Miss Rose!

Now I fear to read Mr. Major’s book.
