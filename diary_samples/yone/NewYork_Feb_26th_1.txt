26th—I lost my little charm.

It worried me awfully.

It was given me by my old-fashioned mother. She got it after a holy
journey of one month to the shrine of Tenno Sama.

I should be safe, Mother said, from water, fire and highwayman (what
else, God only knows) as long as I should carry it.

I sought after it everywhere. I begged my uncle to let me examine his
trunk.

“Cast off an ancient superstition!” Uncle scorned.

I sat languidly on the large armchair which almost swallowed my small
body.

I imagined many a punishment already inflicted on me.

The tick-tack of my watch from my waist encouraged my nervousness.

There is nothing more irritating than a tick-tack.

I locked up my watch in the drawer of the dresser.

I still felt its tick-tack pursuing my ears.

Then I put it under the pillow.
