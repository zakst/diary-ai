26th—I went to Mission Street to call on Madge.

From both sides of the street peeped the famous Jewish noses. The
second-hand clothing shops parade. How droll to see those noses
shrivelling like a lobster!

Madge’s father owns a despicable restaurant with only four eating
tables. Mamma cooks, while she sits on the counter.

When I appeared, she shot out, greeting me: “Hello, Morning Glory!”

“Awfully glad to see you! I have come to help you, haven’t I?”

I was ready to strip off my jacket and wind myself in her apron.

Her papa was dumbfounded by my sudden action.

The outside board with the bill of fare was scraped out by this
morning’s rain. It looked as miserable as an Italian vegetable wagon
under the rain.

My first work was to rewrite it.

I saw a Jew at a neighbouring door striving with one about the value of
pants. A shoemaker’s “pan, pan” hammered on my head from the opposite
house.

Mission Street is the street of horse-dung.

When my job was over, an honourable Mr. Wagon Driver leaped in, bidding
me serve some soup.

I ran into the kitchen to fetch it.

I spilled it on the table.

“That’s all right, honey!” he said in patronising aloofness, and pierced
my face with his gummy red eyes.

O Kowaya! Shocking!

I put one five-dollar piece of gold on Madge’s palm when I left her.

Because her shoes were heelless.

Pity the musume!
