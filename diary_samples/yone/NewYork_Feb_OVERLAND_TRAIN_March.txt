“Madame Butterfly” lay by me, appealing to be read.

“No, iya, I’ll never open! I erred in buying you,” I said.

I dislike that “Madame.” It sounds indecent ever since the “gentleman”
Loti spoiled it with his “Madame Chrysanthème.”

The honourable author of “Madame Butterfly” is Mr. Wrong. (Do you know
that Japanese have no boundary between L and R?) Undoubtedly, he is
qualified to be a Wrong.

Authorship is nothing at all, nowadays, since authors are thick as
Chinese laundries.

Well, still, it can be honourable, if it is honourable.

Japanese fiction penned by the tojin!

It is a completely sad affair. I wonder why the author (God bless him)
didn’t fit himself for brooming the streets instead of scrawling.

The characters in his book—I am grateful I see no lady writer of
Japanese novels yet—remind me of the “devils of mixture” swarming in
Yokohama or Kobe, whose Jap mother was a professional “hell.” It is
lamentable to set the verdict on them that they have inherited the art
of framing lies from their mamma.

Do I vex you, gentleman, when I say that your Japanese type could only
be an unprincipled half-caste?

Your Nippon character eyed in blue, and hairy-skinned always. Isn’t it
absurd when it puts a ’Merican shoe on one foot and a wooden clog on the
other?

And if you insist on registering it as a Jap, I shall merely laugh
loudly.

One heroine I have read of placed a light summer haori over her heavily
padded mid-winter clothes.

Your Oriental novel, let me be courageous enough to say, is a farce at
its best.

Oh, just wait, my sweet Americans! A genuine one will soon be offered to
you by Morning Glory.

I stepped out to the platform, and threw out “Madame Butterfly.”

Poor “Madame!”

I trust in the mountain lions of high Nevada to cherish her lovingly.
