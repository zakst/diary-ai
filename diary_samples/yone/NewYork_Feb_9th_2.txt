9th—Last night I went over to Mrs. Consul’s to be given a lesson in
card-playing.

“Cribbage would be the thing. Why? Because the Lambs took much pleasure
in it,” she said.

“How is poker?” I suggested.

“Gambling game!” she protested.

“I delight in gambling, Mrs. Consul,” I proclaimed.

I had a wicked dream.

What do you imagine?

I ran away with a circus rider.
