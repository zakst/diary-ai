21st—A gardener came to fix our lawn.

There is nothing lovelier than verdant grasses trimmed neatly. They are
like the short skirt of the Meriken little girl.

We women could be angels, I thought, if our speech lapped justly. Women
talk superfluously. I do often.

What language did that gardener use?

It must be the English of Carlyle, I said, for its meaning was
intangible.

I discovered, by and by, that German English was his honourable choice.

My eyes could express more than my English uttered in Nippon voice. My
gestures helped to make my meaning plain.

He became my friend.

He carried a red square of cotton to wipe his mouth, like the furoshiki
in which a Japanese country “O’ ba san” wraps her New Year’s present.

And again as he was leaving I saw a red thing around his neck.

Was it not the same furoshiki which served for his nose?

It wouldn’t be a bad idea to play amateur gardener.

The season wasn’t fitting for such a performance, however.

A large summer hat! That was the customary attire.

But my light-hearted straw one with its laughing bouquet was not adapted
to November, however gorgeously the sun might shine.

And it’s sheer stupidity to track after a tradition.

I wound a large flapping piece of black crape about my head. (How
awfully becoming the garb of a Catholic nun would be! I do not know what
is dear, if it is not the rosary. A writhing rope around the waist is
celestial carelessness.)

I appeared on the lawn, but without a sprinkler and rake. It would have
been too theatrical to carry them.

I gathered the small stones from amid the grasses into a wheelbarrow
near by.

Just as my new enterprise was beginning to seem so delightful, the
luncheon gong gonged.

My uncle goggled from the hall, and said:

“Where have you been? I was afraid you had eloped.”

“I’ve no chance yet to meet a boy,” I spoke in an undertone.

Afterward I was ashamed that I had been so awkwardly sincere.
