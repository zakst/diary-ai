17th—Squirrel!

What admirable eyes!

He projected his head from a hole by my window. He withdrew it a bit,
and bent it to one side, as if he were solving a question or two.

Then his eyes stabbed my face.

“I’m no questionable character, Mr. Squirrel,” I said.

He hid himself altogether.

I amassed some crusts of bread by his hole, and watched humbly for his
honourable presence.

He did not peep out at all.

The bread was not a worthy invitation. I varied it with a fragment of
ham.

Mr. Squirrel wasn’t void-stomached.

I thought he needed something to read. I tore a poem from the wall. I
left it by his respectable cavern.

Lo!

His head sprouted out to pull it in.

“Aha, even the squirrel is a poetry devotee, in this hill!” I said in
humourous mood.
