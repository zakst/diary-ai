17th—I never saw such hungry eyes in my life as those of an
organ-grinder, set upon the windows for a dropping penny.

To an artist they would hint of a prisoner’s bloodshot eyes numbed by
useless gazing toward the light of the world.

Poor Italians!

They don’t know one thing but turning the handle.

The last two days they placed their organ—read their sign, “Garibaldi &
Co.”—under my apartment at the same hour for my bit money.

I thought one of them might be a grandson of the renowned Italian
patriot. How interesting it would be to be told of his shipwreck in
life!

Now three o’clock.

There’s one more hour before their frolic music will gush.

I must wrap some money in paper for them.

God bless them—simple creatures who work hard!
