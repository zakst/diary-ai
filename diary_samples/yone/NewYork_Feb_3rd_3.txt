3rd—The sayonara dinner was given. Mrs. Ellis’ folks joined us.

Mother Schuyler repeated every ten minutes her query, “when would I
visit them again?”

Mr. Oscar set his depressive look on me. I wasn’t brave enough to
encounter it.

I slid away from confronting him.

I found him an elegant young man. He impressed me as an image of Apollo.

Only God knows when I will reprint my footsteps on the soil of Los
Angeles!

I felt awfully sorry in leaving such an agreeable company.


                     “Fold your tent like the Arabs,
                       And silently steal away.”


How sad!
