28th—“Here’s a shamisen, Morning Glory!” Mother Schuyler cried from the
hall.

I darted out of my room.

“Well!” I exclaimed.

Shamisen?

It is a three-stringed guitar of Japan.

Mr. Schuyler, Jr., had sent it from Yokohama, as she explained.

She wished me to tinkle a little gamboling music in the parlour before
dinner.

It is a hard implement to handle. It has no notation. Attainment is
through unending blind practice.

I was compelled to learn by mother, many a year ago, but I soon gave it
up for an English spelling-book.

But I daresay I can play.

I regulated the key to begin with.

“Ting, ting! Chang, Chang, ting!”

“What to hum, Uncle?” I asked, facing aside.

“Love ditty is desirable,” Oji San considered.

“Don’t fancy me a geisha!” I said in defending laughter.

Then I murmured an old hauta, “Haori kakushite,” which was Englished by
some one.


                “She hid his coat,
                She plucked his sleeve,
                  ‘To-day you cannot go!
                To-day, at least, you will not leave,
                  The heart that loves you so!’
                  The mado she undid
                  And back the shoji slid:
                And clinging cried, ‘Dear Lord, perceive
                  The whole world is snow!’”
