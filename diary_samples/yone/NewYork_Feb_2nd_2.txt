2nd—If I were a painter!

My eyes were fixed upon the dying sun. Its solemnity was like the
passing of a mighty king.

Some time glided by.

My thought was pursuing the sun.

The twilight!

Oh, twilight pacifying me as with the odour from a magical palace!

Hush!

The melody of a piano effused from my neighbour.

The best thing in the world is to play music. The very best is to listen
to the profuse melody evoked by a master.

Was it a superb execution?

My soul was dissolved, anyhow, in the rapture.

I left my uncle’s room where I saw the grand sun pass away.

I put me in my bed, because my visionary mood was not to be stirred for
the world, and because I wished to dream a romance without the delay of
a moment.

But I could not slumber.

And I missed my dinner.

I petitioned my uncle to step out into the street for my beloved
chestnuts.

Dear Italian chestnut vendor!

I never pass by without buying.
