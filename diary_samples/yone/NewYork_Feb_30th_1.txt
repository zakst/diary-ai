30th—“Chui, chui, chui!”

A little sparrow was twittering at my hotel window.

I could not believe that the sparrow of large America could be as small
as the Nippon-born.

Horses are large here. Woman’s mouth is large, something like that of an
alligator. Policeman is too large.

I fancied that little birdie might be one strayed from the bamboo bush
of my family’s monastery.

“Sweet vagabond, did you cross the ocean for Meriken Kenbutsu?” I said.

“Chui, chui! Chui, chui, chui!” he chirped.

Is “chui, chui” English, I wonder?

I pushed the window up to receive him.

Oya, ma, he has gone!

I felt so sorry.

I was yearning after my beloved home.

This is the great Chrysanthemum season at home. I missed the show at
Dangozaka.

How gracefully the time used to pass in Dai Nippon, while I sat looking
at the flowers on a tokonoma.

Every place is a strange gray waste to me without the intimate faces of
flowers.

Flowers have no price in Japan, just as a poet is nothing, for everybody
there is poet. But they have a big value in this city—although I am not
positive that an American poet creates wealth.

I purchased a select bouquet of violets.

I passed by several young gentlemen. Were their eyes set on my flowers
or my hands?

I don’t wear gloves. I don’t wish my hands to be touched harshly by
them. Truly I am vain of showing my small hands.

I love the violet, because it was the favorite of dear John—Keats, of
course.

It may not be a flower. It is decidedly a perfume, anyhow.
