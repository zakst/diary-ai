4th—The gentlemen of San Francisco are gallant.

They never permit the ladies—even a black servant is in the honourable
list of “ladies”—to stand in the car.

If Oriental gentlemen could demean themselves like that for just one
day!

I should not mind a bit if one proposed to me even.

I love a handsome face.

They part their hair in the middle. They have inherited no bad habit of
biting their finger-nails. I suppose they offer a grace before each
meal. Their smile isn’t sardonic, and their laughter is open.

I have no dispute with their mustaches and their blue eyes. But I am far
from being an admirer of their red faces.

Japs are pygmies. I fear that the Americans are too tall. My future
husband is not allowed to be over five feet five inches. His nose should
be of the cast of Robert Stevenson’s.

Each one of them carries a high look. He may be the President at the
next election, he seems to say. How mean that only one head is in
demand!

A directory and a dictionary are kind. The ’Merican husband is like
them, I imagine.

I have no gentleman friend yet.

To pace alone on the street is a melancholy discarded sight.

What do you do if your shoe-string comes untied?

I have seen a gentleman fingering the shoestrings of a lady. How glad he
was to serve again, when she said, “That’s too tight!”

Shall my uncle fill such a part?

Poor uncle!

Old company, however, isn’t style.

He is forty-five.

Why can I not choose one to hire from among the “bully” young men
loitering around a cigar-stand?
