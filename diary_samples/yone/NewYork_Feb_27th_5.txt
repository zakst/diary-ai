27th—I intended to keep a sweet fashion of old Japan in presenting a
poem at my sayonara.

We will take leave to-morrow.

O gracious graceful poet abode!

My farewell poem in seventeen syllable form is as follows:


                         “Sayonara no
                         Ureiya nokore
                         Mizu no neni!”

                         “Remain, oh, remain,
                         My grief of sayonara,
                         There in water sound!”
