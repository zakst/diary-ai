12th—The tossing spectacle of the waters (also the hostile smell of the
ship) put my head in a whirl before the “Belgic” left the wharf.

The last five days have been a continuous nightmare. How many a time
would I have preferred death!

My little self wholly exhausted by sea-sickness. Have I to drift to
America in skin and bone?

I felt like a paper flag thrown in a tempest.

The human being is a ridiculously small piece. Nature plays with it and
kills it when she pleases.

I cannot blame Balboa for his fancy, because he caught his first view
from the peak in Darien.

It’s not the “Pacific Ocean.” The breaker of the world!

“Do you feel any better?” inquired my fellow passenger.

He is the new minister to the City of Mexico on his way to his post. My
uncle is one of his closest friends.

What if Meriken ladies should mistake me for the “sweet” wife of such a
shabby pock-marked gentleman?

It will be all right, I thought, for we shall part at San Francisco.

(The pock-mark is rare in America, Uncle said. No country has a special
demand for it, I suppose.)

His boyish carelessness and samurai-fashioned courtesy are
characteristic. His great laugh, “Ha, ha, ha!” echoes on half a mile.

He never leaves his wine glass alone. My uncle complains of his empty
stomach.

The more the minister repeats his cup the more his eloquence rises on
the Chinese question. He does not forget to keep up his honourable
standard of diplomatist even in drinking, I fancy.

I see charm in the eloquence of a drunkard.

                  *       *       *       *       *

I exposed myself on deck for the first time.

I wasn’t strong enough, alas! to face the threatening grandeur of the
ocean. Its divineness struck and wounded me.

O such an expanse of oily-looking waters! O such a menacing largeness!

One star, just one sad star, shone above.

I thought that the little star was trembling alone on a deck of some
ship in the sky.

Star and I cried.
