14th—O snow, yukiya fure, fure!

The season of the city is still within the fence of winter. I was
grateful to my fate that conveyed me here to overtake my loving snow.

I settled me by my window in absorption with the snow view of Hudson
Gawa.

How busily the snowflakes fall!

Their cautiously silent hurry made me recollect the drama of the
China-Japan war. How stealthily the soldiers marched at midnight! Can I
ever forget how I tugged my shoji, crying “Victory, Dai Nippon!”

I raised the window, stretching out my arm. I collected the snow-petals
in the hollow of my palm. I tasted them.

“Uncle, New York snow is as deliciously savoured as at home,” I said.

Central Park must have been artistically attired.

“Oji San, let us go to the park for snow-viewing! I advise you to till a
bit more poetry in yourself, Uncle,” I announced.

I began to change my dress before his decision.
