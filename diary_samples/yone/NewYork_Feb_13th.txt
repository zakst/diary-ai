13th—My first laughter on the ocean burst out while I was peeping at a
label, “7 yens,” inside the chimney-pot hat of our respected minister,
when he was brushing it.

He must have bought that great headgear just on the eve of his
appointment.

How stupid to leave such a bit of paper!

I laughed.

He asked what was so irresistibly funny.

I laughed more. I hardly repressed “My dear old man.”

The “helpless me” clinging on the bed for many a day feels splendid
to-day.

The ocean grew placid.

On the land my eyes meet with a thousand temptations. They are here
opened for nothing but the waters or the sun-rays.

I don’t gain any lesson, but I have learned to appreciate the
demonstrations of light.

They were white. O what a heavenly whiteness!

The billows sang a grand slow song in blessing of the sun, sparkling
their ivory teeth.

The voyage isn’t bad, is it?

I planted myself on the open deck, facing Japan.

I am a mountain-worshipper.

Alas! I could not see that imperial dome of snow, Mount Fuji.

                  *       *       *       *       *

One dozen fairies—two dozen—roved down from the sky to the ocean.

I dreamed.

I was so very happy.
