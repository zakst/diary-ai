Los Angeles, 5th—No one bangs the door at Schuyler’s.

The servants drop their eyes meekly before they speak.

A well-bred atmosphere circulates.

A woman over forty-five is nothing if she isn’t motherly enough to let
one feel at home. Mrs. Schuyler’s silence is a smile. I loved her from
my first glance. I thought I could ask her to wash my hair some sunny
day. I could fancy how pleasant it would be to immerse myself in her
chat—such sort of talk as an old-bonneted “how to keep house”—while I
was drying my hair in the indolence of a sea-nymph. Modern topic is like
black coffee, it is too stimulating. There is nothing dearer than a
domestic subject.

I have no hesitation in accepting her as my Meriken mother.

I am positive I would feel more comfortable if I had one in this
country.

How good-naturedly she was fattened!

A somewhat stout woman looks so proper for a mother.

I wished I could lean on her plump shoulder from the back in Japanese
girl’s way, and play with her hair, and ask a few innocent questions
like “What have I to eat for dinner?”

She talked about the Japanese woman, principally praising her shapely
mouth.

I felt conceitedly, because I was given one classical little mouth, if I
had nothing else to be noticed.

Mr. Schuyler grasped my hand ever so hard. My hand was buried in his
palm. His manner was courteously boyish.

His body is erect like a redwood.

Such an old gentleman gives me the impression of another race from the
divine realm of everlasting youth. A Jap after fifty is capped with
“retired.”

But the work of the American gentleman is only finished when he dies.

Great Meriken Jin!

Mr. Schuyler shows more civility to his servants than to his wife.

Here I can study the typical household of America’s best caste.
