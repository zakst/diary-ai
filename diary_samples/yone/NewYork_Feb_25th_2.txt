25th—I dragged my uncle off to the Chute to enrich my store of zoology.

“One gape more, Uncle, to count up one dozen!” I said, and pulled his
mustache in the car.

It was lucky that no one saw my act.

Poor Oji San! Playing chaperon is not a very promising occupation, is
it?

I stood by the “happy family” of monkeys. I tried to descry their point
of view in orations.

I gave it up.

The vain Miss Polly worked hard to bring everybody to an understanding
with one eternal “Hello, dear!”

I found such grace in the elephant when he waved his honourable trunk.

The stupid Mr. Elephant wasn’t stupid a bit in accepting my present.

How philosophically he gazed at me! Very likely I was the first Jap girl
to his audience.

What respectable eyes!

“You’ll bankrupt yourself in peanuts,” my uncle warned.
