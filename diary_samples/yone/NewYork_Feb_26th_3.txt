26th—It rained.

I implored Mother Schuyler to select a book from her library.

All the literature was packed in there, beginning with Socrates, sane as
a silver dollar.

Every book was without finger-marks. Book without finger-mark is like
bread without brown crust. Dear finger-mark!

The fashion is to buy books and to glance at their covers, I suppose,
but not to read them. Modern publications aren’t meant to be read, are
they? The authors have degenerated to the place of upholsterers. Isn’t
it a shame?

Mrs. Schuyler picked out for me “Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.”

My uncle said: “American woman can’t keep away from Omar and
chicken-salad.”

I began to peruse it.

The raindrops by my window tuned:

“Tap, tap, tip, tap, tap!”

I thumped the book on the floor, and exclaimed:

“Mr. Khayyam!”

Rubaiyat is a menace against civilisation.

Americanism is nothing but the delight in life and the world.

I wonder why the wise government of Washington does not oppose its pagan
circulation.

It is leprosy.

But I thought how truly true was his “I came like Water, and like Wind I
go.”

I took up the book and opened it again.

Then I shut it.

I listened to the “Tap, tap, tip!”

Doesn’t it sound like a wan voice of Omar?

Yes!
