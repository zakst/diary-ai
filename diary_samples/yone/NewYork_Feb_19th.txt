19th—I don’t think San Francisco is very far off now. Shall I step out
of the ship and walk?

Has the “Belgic” coal enough? I wonder how the sensible steamer can be
so slow!

Let the blank pages pass quickly! Let me come face to face with the new
chapter—“America!”

The gray monotone of life makes me insane.

Such an eternal absence of variety on the ocean!
