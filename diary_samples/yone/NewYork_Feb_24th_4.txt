24th—My worthy labourer upon Gibbon’s work sat before the table for some
hours.

I stood behind him and dropped the fluid from a bottle on his head.

“Cold! What are you doing, my little romp?” He looked up in a fright.

“No harm, Uncle! It is only a remedy. Your hair is growing so thin. Do
you know it? I think it a shame to appear in Greater New York with a
bald gentleman.”

I bought the bottle this morning.
