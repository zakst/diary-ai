19th—The Sunday chime was the voice of an angel. The city turned
religious.

Mrs. Willis—I had no curiosity about her first name; it is meaningless
for the “Mrs.” of middle age—indulged in chat with me.

If I say she was “sociable”?—it sounds so graceful.

She announced herself a bigot of poetry. She was bending to make a full
poetical demonstration.

Of course it was more pleasing than a mourning-gowned narrative of her
lamented husband. (I suppose he is dead, as divorce is too commonplace.)

But it were treachery, if I were put under her long recital of the
insignificant works of local poets.

Tasukatta wa!

A little girl came as a relief.

Dorothy! She is a boarder of Mrs. Willis’, the golden-haired daughter of
Mrs. Browning.

(Mrs. Browning was a disappointment, however. I fancied she might be a
relative of the poet Browning. I asked about it. Her response was an
unsympathetic “No!”)

“O’ hayo!” Dorothy said, spattering over me her familiarity.

It takes only an hour to be friends with the Meriken girl, while it is
the work of a year with a Japanese musume.

“Great girl! Your Nippon language is perfect! Would you like to learn
more?” I said.

“I’d like it,” was her retort.

Then we slipped to my room.

I wonder how Mrs. Willis fared without an audience!

I was sorry, thinking that she might regard me as an uncivil Jap.

“Chon kina! Chon kina!”

Thus Dorothy repeated. It was a Japanese song, she said, which the
geisha girls sung in “The Geisha.”

Tat, tat, tat, stop, Dorothy!

Truly it was the opening sound—not the words—of a nonsensical song.

I presume that “The Geisha” is practising a plenteous injustice to Dai
Nippon.

I recalled one Meriken consul who jolted out that same song once at a
party.

He became no more a gentleman to me after that.
