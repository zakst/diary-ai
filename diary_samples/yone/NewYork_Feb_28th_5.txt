28th—Mrs. Heine kissed me.

Dear old Grandma!

“Do you know what this is, Miss Morning Glory?” the poet said, plucking
a leaf from a tree by his door.

“Fig-leaf! Isn’t it?”

“Yes, my child! It is a fig-leaf. Do you know the fig tree? It is the
shyest tree in the world. Classical tree, indeed! It has no blossom,
being so modest of display, but it has the fruits. Remember, my young
lady, its teaching of ‘Modesty! Modesty!’”

“Sayonara, Mr. Poet!”

“One minute, Uncle!” I said.

I ran into the Willow Cottage to get a cupful of water. I watered my
friend Miss Poppy with love.

Bye-bye, little girl!
