26th—We pressed the poet to receive some money as just a sign of our
gratitude.

Mr. Heine despised our thought.

Honourable gentleman!

I found a tin box. I put the money in—ask me not how much!

I dug a hole by the willow tree beside the lily pond, and buried the
money box. I tumbled a stone over it to mark it.

“I’ll write him about it from New York. See, Uncle! Isn’t it unique?” I
said.

Uncle wasn’t enthusiastic in approving my idea. He couldn’t check me,
however, as the money was mine.

He said he would order an elegant vase from Tokio.
