22nd—I passed the afternoon at Mrs. Consul’s. She gave me her
“favourite” discourse on Walt Whitman.

I delivered to my uncle what I had learned.

“No newness in it. It is what dear John Burroughs or Mr. Stedman said.”

He overturned my castle with one blow, and lit his cigar with a
victorious air.

I was enraged.

“Yes, yes, eraiwa! Oriental gentleman knows everything we poor women
know,” I said.

I sulkily drew away to my room with Mr. Whitman’s fat book, that I
borrowed from Mrs. Consul.
