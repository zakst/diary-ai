12th—The poet left the Heights to exchange his MS. for a gallon of
whiskey.

He carried a demijohn, which was as apt to him as a baby to a woman.

I volunteered to clean his holy grotto.

The little cottage brought me a thought of one Jap sage who lived by
choice in a ten-foot square mountain hut. The venerable Mr. Chomei Kamo
wrote his immortal “Ten-Foot Square Record.” A bureau, a bed, and one
easy chair—everything in the poet’s abode inspires repose—occupy every
bit of space in Mr. Heine’s cottage. The wooden roof is sound enough
against a storm. A fountain is close by his door. Whenever you desire,
you may turn its screw and hear the soft melody of rain.

That’s plenty. What else do you covet?

The closetlessness of his cottage is a symbol of his secretlessness. How
enviable is an open-hearted gentleman! Woman can never tarry a day in a
house without a closet.

He never closes his door through the year.

A piece of wire is added to his entrance at night. He would say that
that will keep out the tread of a dog and a newspaper reporter.

Not even one book.

He would read the history written on the brow of a star, he will say if
I ask him why.

Every side was patched by pictures and a medley of paper clippings. Is
there anything sweeter to muse upon than personal knick-nacks?

O such a dust!

I swept it.

But I thought philosophically afterward, why should people be so fussy
with the dust, when things are but another form of dust. What a far-away
smell the dust had! What an ancient colour!

I observed on the wall an odd coat and boots that dear old Santa Claus
might have lost.

“Klondyke costume!” I exclaimed.

I undressed myself, and tried them on.

When I was ready to put on a fur cap, Mrs. Heine wandered down, calling
me.

“Morning Glory! Morning Glory!”

I trembled in deadly fear.

I hid me promptly by the bureau, under the bed. I shut my eyes, praying:

“Namu Daijingu, don’t let her find me!”
