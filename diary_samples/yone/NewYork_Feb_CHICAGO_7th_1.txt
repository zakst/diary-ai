CHICAGO, 7th

Chicago water is a perfect horror.

Gomenyo! That’s no way to begin, is it?

I never waver in saying that California girls borrow their fairness from
their water.

There is no question in my mind why the Chicago women—certain hundreds I
saw, if you please—are barren in their complexion.

“O Uncle, how many days have we to tarry here?” I asked, within an hour
after we had set foot in this city.

I grieve over my contact with such a city. It is no place for a lady.
(Is here any lady?) It is just the place for a man.

No show marked “Only for a Man” is respectable, I dare say.

Are Chicago men “gentlemen?”

They are not sensitive about their hats in the hotel elevator. The
laundry work isn’t superb, I judge, as not every one’s shirt is snowy as
a San Franciscan’s. I cannot blame their black finger-nails, as they
live in smoke.

Even the Frisco smoke hindered my breath at my opening moment in
Amerikey. I should have died, if it had been Chicago.

Bodily cleanliness is the first chapter in the whitening of the soul.
How many mortals are there here with a clear soul?

“Chicago is Mr. Nobody without the smoke, like Japan without a fan. The
prosperity of a modern city is measured by the bulk of its smoke,
Morning Glory. But I don’t approve of their using a cheap coal. Health
has to be guarded,” my uncle said.

A driver carried us from the station as if we were pigs.

Mind you, this is Chicago illustrious for its hams.

I barred my ears with my hands in the carriage. The thunderous noise
menaced me so.

Do roses blossom well in the turbulent air?

I have no doubt that Chicago has no poet.

“Cook County fosters three thousand poets, one paper says, my young
woman,” Uncle said in laughter.

“Don’t say so!”

“As soon as I had established myself in the hotel, I inscribed—with the
longest apologetical ojigi to Mr. Shelley—as follows:


                   “Hell is a city much like Chicago,
                    A populous and a smoky city.”
